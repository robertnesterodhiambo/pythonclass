With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one.

        "I noticed that my coworker's decision tree is overfitting because the depth is set too high (10). With a small dataset (~500 data points), a deep tree becomes too complex and memorizes specific details and noise from the training data. This results in near-perfect training accuracy (~100%) but poor testing accuracy (~60%) because the model struggles to generalize. In small datasets, the model becomes overly specific to the training set, capturing noise instead of general patterns. To fix this, I would recommend reducing the treeâs depth or using pruning techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization."

        "No, the logistic regression and decision tree do not match. Logistic regression uses a continuous, linear relationship between the features (weight, height, and age) and retention, as shown by the equation. In contrast, the decision tree creates discrete splits based on thresholds (e.g., weight > 200 or age > 40). This results in a non-linear, piecewise decision-making process. While both predict retention, the logistic regression model gives a smooth, continuous prediction, whereas the decision tree makes predictions based on specific feature thresholds."
