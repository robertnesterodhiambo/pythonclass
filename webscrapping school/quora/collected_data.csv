How can I stop binge eating all the time? I suffer from a binge eating disorder. I am always craving food, and I eat approximately 5000 calories a day. It is seriously affecting my health, and I want to learn how to control my cravings.

Do you have any tips for an OMAD (one meal a day) beginner who has binge eating disorder? I don’t feel hungry during my fast but as soon as I eat, I have trouble stopping eating even when my stomach is extremely full. What should I do?

I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!
