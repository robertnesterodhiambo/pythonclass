I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!

What has been the most gruesome real footage you've ever seen?
Hi. Let me tell you the story of Tatiane Spitzner and how her recorded death shocked the world and opened many eyes to what exactly domestic violence looks like. Tatiane was a 29-year-old lawyer who lived with her husband Luis Filipe in Guarapuava. Looking at pictures of the couple they looked like a happy and deeply in love couple: But behind these pictures hid a truly shocking reality that ended in a horrific way. On the 22nd of July, 2018, the couple went to a party and when they returned (at around 2:30 AM) they can be seen on CCTV parked in front of their building. They spoke for a little bit and then he suddenly hit her thrice, with considerable strength, in the head. She then tried to run and opened the door, but he forced her to close it and put her seatbelt around her neck, while grabbing her by the hair and punching her head repeatedly. Then they drove to the garage, he parked the car, got out, dragged her out and pushed her against the car. He then punched her throat causing her to pass out and fall to the ground. As she laid there he parked his car and two minutes later he came back and started kicking her until she woke up and got up. When she started regaining consciousness she decided to run for her life and she started running towards the elevator as he chased her. They both managed to get inside the elevator and she clicked the ground floor button instead of the fourth floor where they lived. When the elevator opened on the ground floor she tried to run, and managed to get out but he grabbed her and forced her back inside grabbing her and putting her against the wall until the door closed again. When they got to the fourth floor she put her hands on the sides of the elevator to try and stop him from forcing her to get out, but to no avail. When they left the elevator, it was the last time Tatiane was seen alive. When they got to their apartment, the neighbours heard her cries for help but did nothing. Less than 15 minutes later the camera outside the building filmed her body falling onto the floor. He claimed that she jumped by herself, but it's clear that's a lie because in the video we can see that she was not trying to block her face or even screaming. She was lifeless when she fell. He came downstairs, picked her up and took her to the elevator where he, covered in her blood, started to caress her face and covered her breasts. He took her back to their apartment and then came back and cleaned the blood from the elevator, before driving away. Dunia Rampazzo, a prosecutor on the case, stated: Our investigation proves that the victim was killed inside the apartment by asphyxiation and her body was thrown over the balcony of the apartment. We believe the accused then took the elevator to the ground floor and collected Tatiane’s body, taking it back up to the apartment in the elevator. We suspect that before she was killed, Luis subjected his wife to a prolonged period of violent physical aggression. This was not a suicide, but femicide. The aggressor then attempted to escape by car. The case had multiple delays due to covid, but in May this year, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. If you know someone who has an abusive partner or if you're in such a relationship, get help. Her death cannot be in vain, and it'll hopefully inspire those who need the inspiration to get out while they can. Thank you for reading.

What do you remember about your first relationship?
I wouldn’t call my first boyfriend a relationship. The middle school stuff is just puppy love. My first real relationship was in high school. We lived in the same neighborhood but went to different schools. He played football and was super smart. My parents loved him. Not as much as me of course . We went on dates, walked around the neighborhood, snuck in some hanky panky when our parents weren’t home. We even made love in a hotel room when my parents took us to a fancy NYE party/dance. He left for college a year before me. He stopped calling and writing letters as often and I panicked and broke up with him. That aaa 30 years ago and he has kept up with me all these years. He’s married and has a beautiful family wile I’m still struggling with fear of abandonment that has affected my curren…

Did your ex change after you broke up?
Only after a year and three months of the year was no contact. We both changed. I worked on myself the past year. He worked on himself. We are both more ready to acknowledge on our own issues and we communicate much better. It’s falling in love all over again. He is even more romantic

Have you been intimate with an ex?
Yes. Then we took a break and I worked on myself. Now we are back together. We do not live together like we did previously. It took about 3 months of no contact to get us back together. Try it.

Should I expect an ex-narcissist to come back after he’s had me blocked already for 3 weeks? He’s never done this before.
Why would you want a narcissist back? Focus on yourself and work on becoming the best version of yourself. You have to look within to find out why you want to return to a narcissist. He’s probably with his new “supply” (someone who uplifts his ego) and will pop back up in your life when you’re not giving a care about him l, him, after she’s left.

What are the signs of flirtation that girls miss?
Sometimes girls just don't see the signs especially when they are not used to being flirted with. If a girl is approached by a guy I feel like she should try to relax and maybe see what he's thinking about. If she's given a hint of a date or something else it might help!

As a male I am attracted to only those girls who wear skinny jeans leggings and tights? How normal is this?
I'd say everyone has there own attraction to different types of women. Some men prefer tall, thin, fluffy(little extra lbs), blonde, or brunette women. I guess it boils down to what you want. You are very normal!

Do you feel bad about telling lies regarding your ex?
Depends. I guess I consider an ex exactly that no longer my problem. Spreading rumors about someone you used to care about is immature. I wouldn't recommend it. The best revenge is living your life happily. Doing things that make your life incredible. Being a bit more spontaneous or whatever you enjoy. Don't feed into the feeling you may have of wanting him/her to suffer like you are move on is the best answer.

Should I continue to give her the silent treatment?
Depends on what she did! I personally don't encourage the silent treatment as it gets you nowhere really. If I was in that position I'd try explaining to her how what she did made you feel. Such as when you (blank) it made me feel like (blank) and I'm (happy, sad, pissed off) and I'd like to clear the air between us.

What is the solution to the Palestinian and Israeli conflict?
The Israeli people must adopt the orphans of Palestine, and the Palestinians must adopt the orphans of Israel, and each must raise these children in the religions of the deceased parents. This will bring these peoples together in a just and lasting peace.

My Father never talks to a women with disrespect and i have the same habit. He never spoke a ill word about her with me in his entire life. Whenever i visit my father he asks how is everything at home.My Father even made attempts to forget everything even before my kid was born and tried to invite her for family functions and also gave us to freedom to stay wherever we want, but this time my wife did not wan’t to join family no matter how hard i tried to convince her.
“ who is wrong now”? His father or his wife decide yourself.

How many dads out there don't know how to change their baby's diaper?
You need to get your head in the game, my friend. As your children get older their problems get bigger and more complex. I often wish that I could soothe my troubled 6 year old as easily as I did when she was a baby. Changing diapers is something concrete that you can do to help both your baby and wife. Don’t miss the chance to fix all the problems that have an instant solution!

What are some good crafts to make with toddlers?
Toddlers are easily entertained just not for very long! It's best to have things set up and ready to go but I'm never that organized. Washable paint - Paint with fingers, paint with brushes, cut up some clean sponges (into shapes if you're feeling industrious) and dip the sponges into the paint. Stamps - Stamps and an ink pad are always a hit. Glue- Print their name in glue on a piece of construction paper. Then they can stick marshmallows/cotton/etc to the glue and 'make' their name. Threading: Toddlers can thread cheerios or colorful straws (that you've cut into pieces) onto pipe cleaners. Twist it into a bracelet. Use painter's tape to make a design on craft paper. Let your little one paint all over the paper. While the paint is still wet carefully remove the tape to show the design - grea…

My biggest regret in life so far is having children. How do I learn to enjoy parenting more?
Kids can be boring. Get them involved in things that you like to do. They are incredibly malleable. Just use your powers for good not evil.

No one tells you that sometimes these wonderful bundles of magic suck. Their dispositions can be bad and taking care of them is a lot of work - emotional work, financial work, manual work. Dude, it's a lot. Many long days will be spent trying to wipe up their bodily fluids before those same bodily fluids end up being wiped up on you. That right there can be a whole day. It isn't one long joy fest of parenting. It's a lot (if you're lucky) of little moments that make it profound.

I like your way of studying- this is similar to how I studied in college, too. You mentioned that medication doesn’t always work for you- I’d experienced this too, and after talking with my doctor, found out that most ADHD medication affects women more/less depending on where they’re at in their menstrual cycle. Not sure if this helps/is useful, but thought I’d share!

Is it normal for someone with ADHD to think about multiple topics within a short period of time?
TL;DR: Yes, sometimes. You know that feeling when you’ve read the same paragraph five times, but you still don’t know what it says? That’s what ADHD feels like. It doesn’t necessarily mean that I have racing thoughts in my head all the time, it just means I can’t focus on what I’m wanting to focus on. Sometimes when I’m feeling high energy or excited, I can get racing thoughts like what you’ve described. Sometimes, I feel more like I have a brain fog, and it’s difficult to grasp onto the train of thought that I want without it slipping away. The severity of ADHD is different from person-to-person, and even an individuals lived experience can vary. For example, we know that menstruating women have worse/better symptoms during different times in their cycle. Or, I know I tend to exhibit more “h…

Can Adderall give someone with ADHD a stimulant feeling if they are new to it?
When I was very first figuring out what dosage worked best for me, there were a couple of times that I’d accidentally taken more than needed. Being on too much addy can feel a bit exciting, like a strong caffeine buzz, but it’s not super comfortable, either. I felt like a machine that had been given too strong of a voltage- lots of energy, exciting, but exhausting. On edge, like a taut string.
On both occasions, once the addy wore off my body felt a bit sore, like I’d been dehydrated. I had a difficult time falling asleep, and my appetite was gone. It’s not super fun.

My son has been begging for a new phone. I have tried all the options, but all of them are too expensive. What should I do?
Buy what you can afford. Be open with your child about what you can and cannot afford. If they’re old enough, set up a payment plan with them.
Ie: “I can afford to front X amount; let’s see if we can find a phone in that budget. If you don’t like any of these and want something more expensive, I’m happy to pay that amount towards what you’d like. If you can come up with the rest, we can purchase this phone you’ve been wanting.”

If your adult son/daughter, who is very much capable of working and help witht he house finances, doesn't want to work out of pure laziness and expects to get everything form others, would you let them stay at your house or would you kick them out?
TL;DR: Kick them out. Communicate and set clear boundaries. Help a family member out if you can, but know the difference between helping and enabling. ___________________________________________________________ I had this situation recently with a younger brother. I was torn. He didn’t have a job when he came to live with me, and no savings either. No problem, I’d said, first month’s on me.

Does Adderall make you more motivated and confident (ADHD)?
Adderall doesn’t make me more motivated or confident. It makes my brain quiet, and more functional for modern purposes. I’m definitely motivated to get my job done- I like my boss and co-workers, and completing my job makes work easier for them. I like the sense of accomplishment I get upon completing projects. I particularly enjoy having money to spend on things like food and housing. But sometimes my brain has other plans. My lack of attention isn’t a lack of motivation. It’s a lack of “flow”, or consistency. Starting a task isn’t a problem, but staying on task continues to evade me. Before my diagnosis, I relied on extensive checklists and reminders, and the occasional nudge from a co-worker. Adderall alleviates the need for those extra systems. Adderall doesn’t add motivation- it just mak…

How do I deal with an ADHD child?
It’s encouraging to see this question asked. As a heads up, I do not have a professional background in treating ADHD, so what I have to say is all anecdotal. Both my twin brother and I were diagnosed with ADHD. He was diagnosed around 14, I was 24. Here’s what would have helped: Pro-active Monitoring: In my brother’s case, he was never taken in for diagnosis until he was really struggling in school. He got help after everything had gone wrong. I wasn’t diagnosed, because I managed to squeak by. It took until I was to my breaking point before I got diagnosed, and got help; it’s made a world of difference, and I always wish that I’d had help sooner. If you are a parent and you think there’s a chance your child may have ADHD (it’s highly heritable), keep an eye out for the signs, and get help be…

I learned about this early 2021 around my 30th birthday. I have been under the thumb of the same Narcissistic foster parent (mother) for 25 years, and NEVER have I been allowed to speak the truth or my mind or have a back bone. I remember being backed into a corner by her and her friends being severely abused and hit and beat on as a child. And unfortunately, I've carried that trait into my adulthood, until I woke up at 3 in the morning in pain and went to the ER and found out I almost had a heart attack or stroke either that day or week, and then found out later on that week I developed BOTH Hashimoto's Disease AND Graves Disease (thyroid diseases) and that it's REALLY RARE to have both diseases, and then realized after doing research that it all has to do with using my voice, and that my foster parent was trying to take away my voice and literally kill me. I'm still sick, still have to take medication right now, but little by little I've been using my voice and finding the strength I used to have again. In fact, when the Narcissist foster parent came to see me for my 31st birthday and started stuff, I was able to call her out (which infuriated her) but left me feeling more powerful speaking truth to her lies. But yes, dealing with a Narcissist CAN and WILL put you in the hospital if you don't do something about it.

Honestly, I left her sorry behind in Orlando and dropped her. Went No contact PERMANENTLY.
For YEARS I had put up with her neeed to be the center of my universe, dealt with her insulting comments, didn't wear the same colors as her or same perfumes or eat the same foods as her (etc), dealt with her making comments about me behind my back and our ""friends"" that we shared disrespecting me because of her, her therapist snapping at me for her behavior because she made up stories and blamed me for things, said she ""might"" have done stuff but it was only because of _______ (name your excuse), the list go ones and on…
Until one day, I had enough.
I remember we had a friend who worked at Disney World and we were in Orlando, and she had helped me move to Tampa, and in conversation with her and that acquaintance, I told them MY SPIRITUAL BELIEFS had changed and that I no longer held the same beliefs as then, and they froze, and THAT is when EVERYTHING changed. I saw her become possibly the worst version of her that I had seen. She became angry, asked why I couldn't have told her earlier, then started to argue with me saying trying to tell me about how ""amazing"" and ""great"" our denomination was (at the time) and that the LEAST I could have done was _______(x,y and z). And then she and that acquaintance got up, went into the acquaintance's room and slammed the door, leaving me out in the living room. I sat on the couch and thought all night. Before I realized it, it was morning and the sun was rising. I remember going over how she treated me through the years, whether it was a things done or said and I remembered them both getting up and coming out from their room and her angrily stomping around, wouldn't look at me and put shoes on and went downstairs and the acquaintance making faces at me and closing the door and then 15 minutes later she came back, slammed a venti Starbucks cup full of tea on the table and went back into the acquaintance's room with the acquaintance. Well, I wasn't putting up with it anymore and got my shoes on, took my stuff, put it in the car, took that tea and left QUICKLY and drove my stunned and shocked behind back to Tampa. I was surprised at myself, because I never IMAGINED IN MY LIFE doing what I did or being strong enough to walk away from her, but there I was, in the morning traffic, LEAVING her for GOOD and I wasn't coming back. In the days and weeks and months that followed, she tried to contact me via email and phone calls (to which I bluntly and coldly told her I wouldn't speak to her again, I wasn't explaining anything, and moving forward we will only speak by email), her friends tried multiple times to call me (to which I ended up telling them it's in their beat interest that they mind their own business and stay out of hers and mine), and lived my life. The ex friend tried to contact me multiple times, but I held my ground. It's not say I Don't plan on giving her back why is hers, but it is to say I found my strength and I realize my worth, and I realized I don't need someone who claims to be your friend but it's not a friend. Who makes everything all about her and who needs to be a center of everyone's universe, and whose opinion needs to be the only thing that matters, Who pretends to be a leader and has followers who follow her blindly and treat people any sort of toxic way blindly. Since then, I've learned that toxic people attract toxic people and they come in groups. And I've learned who to let in my life and who did not learn in my life. And I've let go of many friends, and family members, and I have found the strength and self-esteem to be able to make better friends and make better decisions in my life. So I went cold turkey that's what I did with her. I cut her off permanently. For good. I don't know if my story could have helped you, and I don't recommend that everybody do what I did by cutting people off, that's just what I do if that works for me and that's within my personality to do so, and to treat someone coldly and bluntly and to remove them from my life. But I do recommend that you do what's best for you, to remove anyone in your life who is toxic and negative, including friends. And I definitely encourage you to find a method that helps you because you don't deserve having friends in your life who are not loving or supportive or who don't care about you. I hope this helps ❤️.

Why am I wrong to fear that people think that I’m incapable?
You're not wrong for fearing that thought, it's normal to feel that way. But if you're letting it stop you from doing what you can, from living life, then yes, you are very wrong for that. What others think of you and does not matter if they are not there supporting you or encouraging you. Essentially, what others think doesn't matter. Do you think you're capable? If you do, go for whatever it is you want to accomplish . If you don't, only you can sit down and really and truly think over that and figure out what is holding you back and why the opinions of others is tied so strongly into it and affects you so strongly. I will also add this: Not believing in you and your capabilities holds you back from so much in life and all that you can accomplish for you. Never allow the thoughts and nega…

Why is it so hard for people with Major Depressive Disorder to keep our rooms clean?
I will answer this from my own experience : As someone suffering from dysthymia, I have become slow in many things. Cleaning is one of them. A clean house does actually make my head clearer so I should really do it more often. Still, it's rock hard. Why? Let me explain. I am living a pretty isolated life. My husband is off to work everyday and works overtime hours many days. I am pretty much home alone every day. I do have friends but they just live a little far away for me to see them often. I don't mind being alone as I'm introverted and like my own space and silence. Cleaning often just doesn’t bother me. Like many things in life don't bother me. I am thinking alot about why I am alive. Don't get me wrong- I am not suicidal- I just wonder a lot about my purpose on this planet. I am very luc…

How do Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day compare?
So they are up there in my list of bands I love.
Sum 41- Is questioning the world. (The hell song) But has this self deserved anger (still waiting) or sadness (without you) to help provide meaning or searching in life.
Blink 182- Ok let’s make light of real life issues. I don’t need to grow up (Whats my age again) I just wanna do me (shut up) blame my family for who I am (reckless abandon) (anthem part 2) I can’t change nothing (dammit) I’m fuckin sad (Adams song)
Green Day- all I need is me and I love it (Boulevard of broken dreams) (still breathing) (give me novacaine) (brain stew) (basket case)

How do you forgive your haters?
You don’t, u use em as motivators and soon ull evolve godsize (like Pantera’s song). Shove it in their face how awesome u r and how much they aren’t shit compared to u. U secretly act dumb, then u push them to react, and then u realize, u always had the hold over them not them over u. And in the end, u gain this power. And u wonder where it’s been ur whole life.

Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
Nurture. Environment is active and conscious, nature is hidden. Or so for me that’s how I feel. Imagine being born with the most desirable genes and traits, but you go through hardships your whole entire life , the traits that are most valuable to you, of course will stick, but the hardships will cause great havoc in traits that are vulnerable.

Another right here 🤚🏻 trust us all when we say nobody gives a flying fuck. Also trust me when I say, those who don’t give a fuck, will at some point begin to when they repeatedly get accused of something and have it shoved down their throats. So please don’t act surprised when white people do become actually begin to show hate and make attempts to “discredit” whatever bullshit you’re spewing, because you’re literally asking for it sparking these debates. All. The. Time.

Do I still deserve to be happy after all the mistakes I had in the past?
How awful could it be? Hurting someone in purpose is such a bad idea. For whatever reason it is, what's past is past. If only a time machine exists so that you can travel backward and ensure everything was right in the first place. Everyone seems to travel in time to re-do everything all over again. That's the idea of a perfect world. Get rid of the things that could probably drag you from overthinking. Try to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. No doubt, it haunts you like forever? Be thankful for what you have. The power of being thankful even when things don't go your way. Look after something or someone that can make you happy. After all, you just have to move on and be ensure to keep your head up.

Why does make up make me happy?
Drop dead gorgeous wannabe. Who doesn't? Anyhow not too much intentionally. The no make-up makeup look is quite highly desirable. It really takes a good practice to actually master the techniques. I adore people who can do good in makeup and how they can pull it off effortlessly. I dream of someday being a professional makeup artist :)

How can I keep myself together and stay up after not sleeping?
It's somehow very frustrating because all you want to do is going to bed. Your mind, body is tired but you can't sleep. Do you think you are in a state of depression? Perhaps. Probably because it leads to imbalances in chemicals in the brain. At first by trying to avoid using your mobile phone before going to bed yet at the same time you wants to do some reading. It will start to drag you by minutes to hours. While your alarm clock is set at 5.30am. Now it almost 3 in the morning. It can be so stressful until you actually woke up by the alarm feeling restless. Kick-start your day with a cup of coffee will do. Boosting up a bit even though your mind is unable to rest and relax.

Why do people hurt you if you have a good heart and soul?
Remind yourself that kindness is always the answer. We are treated somehow a good wellbeing to not hurt others. To always put ourselves in peoples’ shoe. What if? What if it happens to us, what would it be like to overcome the circumstances? We go beyond the consequences beforehand. By showing some respect I am pretty sure we will less likely to hurt people. Not everyone have the same thinking as we do and by the way of that, we tend to not involve with this circle of population any longer.

I am in tears. I can only imagine how horrific it must have been to actually witness something like that. Your descriptive telling of events brought pictures to my mind that both hurt my heart and astounded me. The suffering that poor man went through—it just wrecks me to think about it. Thank you for showing him care and compassion during his last days. I’m not very religious, but I pray he is now completely in peace.

Can drinking water cause your urine to turn dark brown?
Hello, as far as I know, no. There are several factors that influence the color of your urine so it's best to consult a doctor to figure out if the cause of your unusual urine color is pathological. :)

What is the function of alkaline phosphatase, and why is it used in hematology tests?
Hello I'm just a student studying medical technology so I am not an expert but from the review material I am studying it mentioned that it is a nonspecific enzyme that is found in many tissues but it's major tissue sources are the liver, the bone, the placenta, and the intestine. From what I understand the value of measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lies not in measuring the total ALP levels but in measuring it's isoenzymes. The isoenzymes of ALP is associated with several conditions. The liver isoenzyme is usually elevated in obstructive jaundice, the bone isoenzyme is elevated during osteoblastic activities that's why it is normally elevated in children during periods of growth and, pathologically, in patient's with osteitis deformans. The placental ALP elevates in pregnant women. The…

I'm a targeted individual that is going through the suffering of everyday gangstalking I too also am aware of who is stalking me. My question is what can I do, or who do I call to get justice for me, and my children who are the innocent victims of this sick way of abusing, bullying, and harassment. And in my case I have been sexually abused over and over again by this particular obsessed group. I am going to give you some names of who I know to be involved. The first person that is immediately involved as a perpetrator is Terrance “ tuggs” Winfrey age 35 location in Spokane, WA and his family located off of Greene and 4th Ave in Spokane Washington. And his family that is also located in Sacramento, CA as the Grovan family their headquarters are at Pat Grovan's house in her basement. The entire family which happens to be over 30+ members have all taken part in the stalking, harassment, and sexual assault of myself and claimed to have done this to members of my family. They are upset because I don't want to be with one of their family members which happens to be Terrance”tuggs” Winfrey. If there's any added information that you have for me please let me know right away.

Very interesting ways of looking at jealousy and how to not always be so closed minded and negative about the situation because it should be taken as a way to work on yourself in a positive light don't short change yourself and feed that negative approach to jealousy, When embracing the fact that you have this time in your life to reflect on who you are and what you want, minus all the yucky entanglements of emotions, and hatred you have for someone else. Your free from the burden of them having the reins on your emotions. Isn't that something.

Isn't being yourself the reason why you got in this mess in the first place? I know I am not fake or phony and don't have to put on an act for nobody. My emotions are real and I don't sugar coat nothing. But this must be enough to keep some people obsessed with my personality. It almost makes me want to do the opposite of being myself, because maybe it would help all of us out by them being able to learn different things to do instead of obsess over me and would also help me find peace

Very true. I look at men's shoes when I find the man physically attractive. If they have horrible off brand shoes and he's cute I find him less attractive after that. Sometimes I can view that differently as well by having nice shoes or a good unique style it can make the man attractive even if he's not so attractive style is everything.

Why was my thirteen-year-old upset when I told her that she was too old for a birthday party?
Because your a birch for that. Why would you tell your 13 year old she's too old for a birthday party? And then ask why she got upset? Not okay. You probably broke her heart. Wouldn't you want your child to still be a child and be able to do those things for her at any age. What is wrong with you?

I totally agree with you about the rate of speed ppl drive & they love to ride your bumper to get you to move, even police officers do it. It’s very annoying when ppl are walking in the streets holding signs up asking for money. I know which convenient stores to avoid due to this problem. The things that go on here is not just a Baton Rouge problem, this is happening every where. There’s a lot of racism & rude people, but we also have some friendly ppl I've ever met.

I was born & raised in Baton Rouge. I have my moments where I hate living here & times I love it. There’s a lot racism’s here, & some of the schools are awful. L.S.U is a great university, but to me it's a place to party. They have a great football team, but I can care less because I'm not a fan of anything dealing with sports. We also an H.B.U.C ( SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY) with one of the best nursing programs ( my opinion) yaay jags. It's not a lot of stuff to do these days. I don't travel much because I'm a full-time college student, & simply don't have the time. New Orleans is a 60/90 minute drive & one of my favorite places to spend a weekend. There's definitely always something going on in N.O almost every weekend & I love the nightlife there 😊. But honestly if I had it my way I would’ve moved some place else where it snows but my husband not having

That’s not how Jesus would speak about anyone and you have no right to judge her because you are a sinner too (John 8:7) and you’re no better (Romans 14:1–23). Jesus taught us to love everyone and to be peaceful (1 John 4:16–19), even to those that are not Christian. Please practice what you preach.

My theory is it's a very high sensitivity of clairvoyance, but without support in learning how to control it on a spiritual level and grounding it, it can be destructive.

Do you think most mental health issues are psychic abilities that are uncontrolled? Such as people with OCD and intrusive thoughts are probably picking up on thoughts/energy from spirits or from people around them.

They are tricksters and if they cannot directly attack you, they may find their way through people you care about to try and weaken your spirit. Its so important to pray, meditate, focus on being love, being positive, and have faith because this strengthens your aura and this can shift others around you to a higher frequency as well. Also, when you are aware of their tricks, you hold more power over them.

Yes, in hindsight I realized that I should have told my parents what was going on and I was very, very naive. However, being only 12 years old at the time I sadly didn’t know what abuse really was (especially emotional and sexual abuse) so I didn’t know at the time that anything was wrong. Also, he had me so manipulated that I was scared to tell anyone that what was happening didn’t feel right because I didn’t want him to get in trouble. He had me convinced that he “loved” me and that he was there for me over anyone else.
Years later when I told my mom some of what happened, she told me that at the time it was almost like I was in a trance or was brainwashed because no matter how many times she told me to stop talking to him, I just wouldn’t listen to reason. That’s actually common in abuse victims.
If I could go back and change things, believe me, I would in a heartbeat.
I wish that 12 year old me had been more educated about what behaviors from boys (especially older ones) are okay and what aren’t. Luckily, more schools have programs that discuss sexual abuse now so more children are being taught what is okay and what isn’t when it comes to touches and behaviors from other people.
Thanks for your response.

As a young adult (20) who was a disrespectful and sassy 12 year old daughter myself, I would try to calmly sit down and talk to her and let her know that you’re there for her. I’d ask her what’s going on and explain to her that you don’t appreciate how she’s been acting and that you took her phone as a result of her behavior. All behaviors have consequences and punishing her for being disrespectful and rude is fine. But my guess is that something is causing her to act the way she is. I can tell you that I and many friends I know greatly valued privacy at that age, and she may have lashed out because she felt her privacy was violated when you took her phone. Maybe ask her if that’s why she got so upset when you took it as a punishment. I always had an attitude at that age because I was feeling so much and going through so much. I had undiagnosed anxiety until I was 16 which came with depressive episodes and I was self harming and felt suicidal regularly. I was also being bullied and sexually/emotionally abused. All of these were things my parents didn’t know about so they didn’t understand why I was in emotional turmoil and being so defensive and rude to them. I didn’t feel like I could talk to them about it and when they would get frustrated with me and get angry at me for being so upset all the time it made me feel like they would never understand and that I was all alone. I’d shut myself away in my room and just wanted to be alone and seemingly never wanted to interact with them. And when they made me interact with them, I was negative and kept to myself the whole time. When they’d ask what was wrong and why I was being so rude I would immediately get defensive and get an attitude because I felt attacked. Does that sound familiar? If so, and if she won’t talk to you about whatever may be going on, I would recommend looking into a therapist or mental health professional. Even if it’s not something like anxiety or depression, your daughter may be having a tough time dealing with emotions and feelings that come with being 12 and puberty. I know that for myself, my hormones were all over the place and I just didn’t know how to cope with that. Therapists can be for everyone and don’t have to be a forever thing. Everyone can use some help coping with the stress of life sometimes and believe it or not, being a 12 year old girl can be very stressful. Now, I’d also like to mention that as a parent you do have the right to go through your daughter’s phone and see if anything is going on. And doing that may end up being necessary. However, if you choose to do that please seek professional advice on how to go about that in a healthy way because it can be really traumatizing to the child. When my parents wanted to search my phone when I was younger it was incredibly stressful for me because even though I knew that they owned the phone and had a right to, that was one of the only things I had as a teen where I had a certain amount of privacy expected and them demanding to search it felt violating. I think it’s really easy for parents to forget that it’s important that their kids need a certain amount of privacy too as another human being. I hope any of this helps and I hope that things work out soon with your daughter. Best of luck to you.

What?? I never said to subscribe to me what are you talking about lol. This is the very first time in like the three years I’ve been a member of quora that I posted something and regretfully so! I never post or answer anything I’m just someone interested in reading things from knowledgeable people. Unfortunately, not everyone on here who answers questions are knowledgeable of the subject…. ahem…. anyways, I don’t owe you a name or a profile picture and it doesn’t make me any less human just because I don’t show those things. And no need to project your lack of substance onto me, which appears so obviously in your “writing”.

Lol. And I’ve seen many people like you who structure their sentences and say certain words against borderlines like you do. The point is I was just trying to help you see something I felt you weren’t noticing and that maybe you were answering some questions incorrectly because of your negative experience. But yes I realize now my words have fallen on deaf ears and you are determined that everything you say is correct and that anything I say is discredited because I have bpd. But you’re entitled to your opinions, I just thought I could get some kind of proper response from you but you responded in the way I was afraid you would. So I understand now there was no point in trying to talk with you to try to help you understand that all the things you write about borderlines aren’t correct. I am not implying that everything you say is wrong, what I am saying though is that some of the things you say are wrong. It doesn’t matter if you’re an asshole about it or sugar coat it, I don’t care about that, that wasn’t my point… what I care about is that some of the things you’ve written are incorrect therefore spreading misinformation. And if multiple people have told you this before perhaps it’s not us that’s wrong, it’s you lol.

Look, Jason, i initially read your response to this question then ventured over to your profile and saw numerous answers you gave regarding bpd questions. It feels like you have a biased view on borderlines because of your negative experience with a bpd person. I completely understand why you’re so angry and why you feel like bpd individuals are “shitty”. However, it’s important to remember that just like there are “normal” people who are shitheads and who are not, the same goes for borderlines. I understand there are people diagnosed with this disorder that do have bad intentions and who don’t care about the suffering they inflict on to others, perhaps for those kinds of people it is too late for them, I have met those types of people before. This can be said about anyone suffering from anything, not just bpd. Some people, in general, aren’t good people at heart. That being said, and I cannot stress this enough, NOT ALL BORDERLINES ARE BAD PEOPLE. There are borderlines out there that have tried so hard to get better. Some have and some are still on that path. They do not get enjoyment from being the way they are. They don’t get enjoyment from being mentally ill and from seeing their loved ones suffer because of their unintentional wrong-doings. It may sound silly coming from me but, it’s not so black and white. I don’t want to be this way. I do whatever I can to get better. Getting better has become a life long journey. And in order for this bad stigma to go away that’s associated with those who have borderline, it is crucial that people like you don’t spread hate. Whether you see it or not, I am telling you your post sounded hateful. And you have every right to be hateful towards a person who hurt you or affected you so negatively. But to group everyone together and assume that all borderlines fit into one giant shitty person category is wrong to do. You may be stuck with the thoughts you have towards bpd people because of your experience with them, and nothing I, or anyone says will change your mind. That’s fine. I understand what its like to be so sure of something. But because you’ve never experienced it yourself, as in you actually having it, it may be near impossible for you to truly know the magnitude of how this disorder feels. I may have trouble with my thoughts and emotions but I’m still a decent person with morals and values and try to be as non judge mental as possible. My personal relationships are chaotic and I have many deep issues I need to understand still to hopefully get past this. Maybe I never will. But please, if you want to answer questions about bpd, please don’t spread misinformation. Please read non-biased information about bpd. And if you can’t be un-biased, please don’t spread hate and lies. Not every bpd is the person who hurt you.

Drive to a gas station and ask some people for help I see people all the time asking for money for gas and when I do have it I give . You might meet some nice people and mean and it may be hard to ask but it might work it’s just a idea

What are the temperature control features of Instacart's delivery vehicles? How do they compare to those of Amazon Flex and Postmates?
Instacart does not have a fleet of delivery vehicles. They do not send out “temperature controlled” company cars or trucks at all. When you order through Instacart, the order gets sent out to independent contractors (aka: Moms, Dads, students, neighbors, anyone who needs extra income can sign up to SHOP & deliver for Instacart). When that order gets picked up, that person will drive their own vehicle to the store, park, go inside & shop for the items on your list, go to checkout, wait in line, bag your groceries, load them back into their personal vehicle, drive to your home, unload all bags & carefully leave them at your doorstep. Would you like to know the average pay for someone who is doing all that work AND driving their OWN vehicle? I can tell u that it’s barely enough to cover the gas…

Yes, in fact, the Instacart app will send you a push notification after the order has been placed (but before its been picked up by a shopper) that asks you if there is anything else youd like to add. The app will also show you items to buy based on your previous order history. If your order is already being shoppe...

Would I be the worst person ever if I returned 2 of my 4 dogs to the shelter? I am a single parent and struggling to cope.
Yes. Dogs are family. Find a way to cope.

Can’t we do better….for Dixie and all the others?
Author Unknown “I was leaving the dollar store today and the cute little lady in front of me , alll dressed up, was struggling. She didn’t know her PIN number at the register. The man behind me kept sighing and said “Come ON” while the cashier and I tried to help her. When she was trying to leave, she asked for help trying to get the cart out the door because it had a big pole on it to prevent people from taking the carts out. I explained that they weren’t allowed outside and that I could help her. She immediately declined but looked out at the parking lot and then back at all her bags. “Really,” I said, “I would love to help.” She said, “Oh I couldn’t do that. You might not even be parked near me!” Seriously? When walking out with her, I learned her name was Dixie and she was 83 and stopped in after church and the grocery store. “These errands wear my old body out!” She sighed as we loaded the bags into car. The part that made me so sad was when I finished and shut the trunk, she asked me how much she owed me. I laughed and answered but she said, “No, I must pay you!”. Obviously, I declined and told her to have a beautiful day BUT how tragic is it that she thought she should pay me to walk with her to her car. Sparklers, we must do better. We must be proactive, bolder and deliberate with our kindness. We are failing our elderly. We are failing our young ones who will only know a world such as this. We are failing each other. Step up and go outside of your comfort zone today and just spark. Seriously! Oh…and invite your friends worldwide to our group so we can set this world on fire with GOODNESS.” Author: Unknowns Source: Let’s Spread the Kindness

60 Minutes had a hit piece on Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, but failed to disclose these facts: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the US Naval Reserve Center in Dallas Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant junior grade, to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a Lieutenant Commander in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal. He represented Florida's 6th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018. Obviously, with these qualifications, he is NOT qualified to be a Democrat, or serve in a senior political position in our nation’s capital when one considers and compares the credentials of Pelosi, Schumer, Harris or Biden. He has kept Florida free of the grip of a tyrannical federal government while our State of Florida still prospers, which is why more people have moved to Florida than any other state for the last couple years. So, for anyone who criticizes him, I have a request of you. Can you please post your education and service to our country in a resume so we can compare and put your opinion in perspective? THIS, my fellow Americans is the greatest Governor in our nation! I hope 2028 we find him in the White House...right after VP to Trump in 2024

I don’t know if it’s comfort, it’s what I’ve seen while working in the field of behavioral health. I’m sorry that presenting it in a matter-of-fact way is disturbing to you. There was typically an incident that led to them being there, either a threat to harm someone else or themselves. Being placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold is a process that requires more than just conjecture; evidence is needed for that hold.

Hi Manny, I appreciate you explaining a lot of these intricacies. (This is not sarcasm, I know it’s hard to tell over the internet). But you did a really good job of making this easy for someone who is not super well-versed on these issues to understand. I appreciate that.

My mom’s favorite to use on me: “if you would just try harder…..”
If I would just try harder what? Will my brain chemistry change? My genetics? (Granted I do realize a certain level of “trying” is needed in order to develop coping skills and emotional regulation skills).
The assumption that I am NOT trying is insulting. This is me trying.

…thank you to the person who already said “ok boomer”, but may I reiterate: “OK BOOMER”.
Sir, I have no idea if you are a baby boomer or not, but your comment sounds very inline with something a baby boomer would say about the Millennial Generation.
Were all of the Millennials who VOLUNTARILY signed up for the military immediately following 9/11 doing so because they knew “no hardship, pain, or suffering”?
OR were all the Baby Boomers who had to get DRAFTED demonstrating their lack of desire to go through “hardship, pain, and/or suffering”.
Have some respect for your Millennials.

100 truth. The Gambino's primarily own Long Island and also have a significant presence in Rochester, Miami, some neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn along with sprouting up in Los Angeles and other parts of California. The Genovese have control over pretty much all upstate New York outside of Rochester and The Arms Turf. The Genovese are also VERY VERY dominant around Portland in Oregon which is why the Russian mob (who own that territory) are at war with them now. The Latinos are also at a turf war with parts of The Outfit and more specifically the Genovese/Lucianos in Chicago. Many of the things that the Feds say on the news is false! The Mafia is still around and have a much different kind of influence then they used to. They infiltrated parts of law enforcement on Long Island in order to have a heads up on arrests for their guys and associates. They infiltrated parts of the FBI Office in Upstate New York for the same reason. The Genovese have a significant amount of family members in the Southwest part of the country who are either in the military or are ex-military. Many of the things they used to do mutated into things like mortgage fraud, identity theft, credit card skimming, COVID-19 assistance program fraud, tax fraud and other white collar crimes because they carry much less jail time.
The Mafia is evil.

United Blood Nation.
The West Side signed itself out of the UBN. And that's, not the East Side’s problem.
The founder of the Bloods which was founded in LA, was incarcerated in Rikers with a high ranking member of the Lucchese Family. When the Families didn't want him, they exiled him to LA. From that animosity he had towards The Families he found an excuse to find another Gang “to protect the Blood Families from the Crips”. The same founding statement of La Cosa Nostra and La Camorra from 800 years prior.

Involved? You're Funny! The Gambino Family uses the Bloods Gang to do all of its hits even to this day! They would never throw one of their own under the bus unless they were a snitch! The Lucchese Family and it’s founder were in prison with the Founder of the Bloods in Rikers so they share a very special bond. The Crips are closer with the Lucianos and Genovese on the West Coast and in Chicago. Whereas, Luccheses and Gambinos are very close with the Bloods in New York and on the East Coast. In General, the Italian Mafia has allowed people in the Bloods and Crips to marry into their Families under certain circumstances like when their is strategic value. So to answer your question, their are affiliated but not always on a personal level and more on a business level.

Why are people more united by what they hate than by what they love?
It's the same reason why everyone around the world wanted to help NYC on 9/11. And on every other day people in NYC are considered rude, self centered and selfish.

I don't want to be gay. Is there any way to stop it?
It's a blessing to be gay. Gays dress better, have better jobs, make more money, are generally better people, happier, when they get married they appreciate it more, better style and cook better - just to name a few. Be who you are.

I'm 90 days sober from a five year meth addiction. I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and struggle to do things. When will it get easier and what can I do to feel better?
It took about a year for me to start to feel better (I slept a lot). It has been an uphill battle, but worth it ultimately, as I could not live any longer as I was.
After 2 1/2 years, I feel tremendously better!

How does your anger affect your relationships?
Man. My anger at my junky tweeker ex is so bad that the woman I use to love is now who I send the most vile hurtful messages to and it’s tsking me down a dark hole. My energy is down and it’s pouring into the rest of my life. Anger is good when you take the lesson on why you are feeling it. It’s causing me to want to destroy her but I’m hurting myself in the process.

What is your review of Bremerton, WA?
Bremerton is a navy town. Ship port to be exact. It’s old. Run down for the most part. Lack of good jobs and rampant meth use that had already wreaked havoc in the early 90s. When we were young all we did was get into trouble. Bremerton is really a dump.

What are baby steps you can start taking to start loving yourself and what you look like?
If there are things you don’t like about yourself that you CAN change then tackle one thing at a time. Take something little that is easier and fix it. Celebrate your victory and then tackle something else that you will make you feel better about yourself. Baby steps. Accept the things you can not change and be the best most confident you that you can be!

What are some good coping mechanisms to stop someone from relapsing?
You can’t stop anyone from relapsing. For one, you cant make anyone do anything. For two relapsing is part of the process so they say, not sure what they might relapse on, but a few things are nasty, life and soul consuming and its an ongoing battle for life I have heard.
You can encourage and support them, let them know you care and help them see there is a different option.

This person appears to be asserting that a large big toe relative to the other toes may be an indication of ""nervous weakness"" that the person is attempting to conceal, maybe by being inconspicuous or avoiding drawing attention to themselves. Just to be clear, here is no scientific evidence to support the notion that the size or form of a person's toes is related to their personality or behavior in any manner.

Quite difficult to apply to those who are Ignorant and/or Irrational but it is the right thing to do! I do and have believed this is the way to deal with all the hate and deceitfulness in the world today towards others.

What is the meaning of Romans 12:19-21?
It is surprising how difficult this passage is for Christians to understand, although it is straightforward when you read it with an open mind. Paul is saying not to seek revenge against your enemies. Paul makes a vague allusion to Deuteronomy 32:35, saying that any revenge should be left to God. He then says that if we go out of our way to be good to those we consider enemies, helping them in any way possible, we will cause them to suffer burning shame (“coals of fire”) with greater effect than any revenge is likely to achieve. He summarises: Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil with good.

My Son joined right out of high school, went 0311, it was tough but he really felt like he was where he was suppose to be, it was home for him. He then was selected for MSG, passed the course and did some Embassy time, then was selected to a FAST Team which he seems to like too, but his sense of loyalty is… and always will be with the Infantry no doubt. One builds a bond, a sense of loyalty and a deep appreciation/understanding for what sacrifice and commitment means for the betterment of the guy next to you, the Corp’s and service to (and for) our nation.That life lesson can be well worth the investment of what one would put into it and conversely what one would get out of there experiences’.
However, there is something to be said about acquiring skills through other POG MOS’s, the VA working as it should and the fact you are left to pickup the pieces once your out. Though my son has had… and friends of his have had offers with major corporations offering them employment as soon as they get out for 6 figure security contracts both privet sector as well as Government both in country and out. So I see it as… make the best out of whatever you decided to do. Your training will help you move forward in life if you embrace the training use it as your weapon to go out there and make your way in this world.
And as a (Combat-Veteran myself} who served in the ARMY and have had more experience with the VA and society in general than most on the subject. I agree with the OP on his assessment of what really happens to the Vet’s here at home after all the hard work, sacrifice and hardships left for you and your loved ones to deal with can be extremely challenging. It’s a fight all the way through life, why not get to see some of the world on there dime and pick up what you can to get a running start when exit the service. As one E-8 MARINE said to me the other day, “It beats working at Wall-Mart”. Give it a shot if you apply yourself there is no telling where you might end up because there’s always opportunity if you look for it.

AGREED: Solid Perspective on Reality! Contrary to a lot of people’s belief’s, As a Veteran who has experienced/participated in a coup/take-over Military Coup/Take-Over of Government and repatriation of it’s population, it’s population. It’s my contention that it is… very possible that if the extreme shift of the Ult-Left continues to push this narrative of extremism ideology, extremism/ideology and propaganda, “our way or we all burn” type mentality, we will see those who are now understanding (maybe for the first time) it’s now or never to rise and save what’s left of this Republic and that for which it stands… they (we) very well could loose everything if they we don’t fight back with equal or greater force “you force. I believe we will end up in a civil war for a number of reasons, and I know from experience, “Sometimes it takes a wolf to kill a wolf”. The sheep dogs aren’t getting it done against this uprising of the kind of violence we are experiencing from the extreme left today. The kinds of mass rioting and civil disobedience directed at our current President, who is the legitimate Elected Government Official, is (in my eye’s) Treason and puts all of us at risk if it’s not stopped and stopped quickly. Whatever it takes to get these unruly masses under control must and ultimately will be a wolf to kill a wolf”, just being a sheep dog won’t get it done.done or we will all suffer the consequences.

I’d rather be in a foxhole with someone that wanted to join, than someone who was guilted by a total stranger on the internet, and called a coward. I think it takes quite a bit of courage to profess you made a mistake and don’t want to serve.
Signed a combat infantryman.

That’s a fair and reasonable question brother, and I’m glad you’re at least willing to consider another candidate, if available. I’m a lifelong registered republican, gun owner, combat infantryman , a Texan, and hell I have a shaved head, a beard, and beer belly! I am the stereotypical dream demographic of a Trump follower by all visual, and assumed standards. I shamefully admit I voted for Trump in 2016 for the mere fact that he represented the least of two evils (Hillary). I just as shamefully did not vote for either candidate in 2020, and will be voting 3rd party or write in “deez nutz” in November’24.
Trump ain’t no republican brother, he has masterfully found inroads to a usually silent majority(?) and manipulated that disenfranchised group of Americans to a fever pitch, he’s a genius by no means, but rather a shrewd manipulator of basic human nature of a certain demographic.
Biden is not a viable option either, trumps meteoric rise to prominence was a set of dumb luck, perfect opportunities represented by 2 of the worst polarizing democratic candidates that folks hate so much they will vote for anything that is the polar opposite of these two democrats.
I’m 55 and have never witnessed a hatred filled, vitriol controlled constituency anything near what Trump has created.
Ive never feared a constituency until trumps creation, I can take care of myself, but trump owns the golden dog-whistle. I’m sure a large majority of my associates, combat brothers, and general public will continue in goose step admiration for him.
I’m not hearing anyone of his followers saying things like “Trump is a mess but Biden isn’t a better choice,” people are “convinced” that Trump is the best candidate ever?!
Human nature, unfortunately, is very easy to manipulate in large groups, Trump has rewritten the book in this arena…I don’t even wish ill will on Trump…I’m also looking for an alternative to the two jokes that the “powers that be” have decided are the best choices.

Thank you for being a bright light in an otherwise pit of darkness. You could have easily looked the other way, ignored, or even added to their mental anguish. You chose to show compassion to souls who have no hope or even understand why or where they’re at. I wish blessings on you and hope you realize the blessings you brought to your fellow inmates, you did this for no other reward than that of knowing you were helping unfortunate souls, while you yourself was suffering the same hell. I am certain your acts will be rewarded in this life or when you pass into eternity. Bless you.

What are LGBT+ people tired of hearing?
“So, when did you choose to be gay?” My response is always “When did you choose to be straight?” the look on their faces is priceless! Haha. Also, when men preach that they're against homosexuals and then say “It's only okay if it's just girl on girl.” Then proceed to ask if they can watch or join.” HA. Men that act like that should have no right to vote against gay marriage. When men talk about how disgusting gay men are in terms of how they male love..Like, really bitch! Who cares bc love is love and if they dont agree they should just keep their mouth shut bc it does not affect their life what. so. ever. The funniest one is when they ask “how do lesbians have sex?” welp if they had to ask that then I feel sorry for whoever is dating them. Lol I could go on for days.

What do you mean he prepared for it by doing a modified low crawl? I don’t know how to swim and I’m in process of enlisting.

I'm pretty sure this anonymous muslim is just an undercover hindutva guy idealising BJP and their unjust culling of muslim minorities in India. India have been nothing but absolute shit head. They spread rumors regarding Bangladesh, they spread rumors about homes of muslim cricketers that were burned and made it seem like it was hindu household, just to paint a wrong picture in media and many more. And I can vouch that the “rape muslim women and make India Hindu again” is a BJP punchline, not muslim, but the punchline of hindu extremists. I have no respect for them, and just a few days back they opened a dam in the middle of the night without prior notice and flooded many district in Bangladesh, and many people died, hindu and muslims boths. Where is their humanity now? Domestic violence is something requiring attention despite all religions, and this guy is nothing but spewing bullshit besides bathing in it.

Dude, in what world XD your personal experience does not total the whole tall woman demographic. In fact, it is you all “short queens” who are after the tail of tall women, as is evident from all these answers: “size of a man” “The Hulk” psst grow up (pun intended) you guys sound so immature trying to fit in your demographic in these answers. And you sound like a “pick me” by creating divides based on your imaginary feuds with tall women. We don’t really give a damn.

Should a parent watch over their 8-year-old child whilst bathing if the child keeps coming out of the bath covered in soap? What if the kid feels embarrassed about the parent seeing their privates?
Depends. My daughter is 8 years old and just completed a mile stone of taking a shower solo. I told her her that it’s time to see if she could successfully shower without assistance. It went well. She was concerned she might not have rinsed a 100% but that’s okay. She is learning and will get better over time with verbal reminders. She does like me to wash her back but today I told her to do her best. Ask your 8 year old if he/she would like help. If they answer no, respect that boundary. Verbally remind them what to wash and rinse well. If there is soap or conditioner in the hair that is obviously hard to hide, have the child get back in there and rinse A second time. It’s inconvenient for them to do so especially when they want to do something else. To be honest…If I had not rinsed well en…

I wouldn't be able to do it. Lol I'm Mexican and I just pull my friend aside and mention that I don't eat meat but appreciate the offer. I mention that I'd be happy to eat some sides or anything without pork, chicken or beef. I eat seafood but that's as far as I am able to eat anymore. If I don't eat something I'm not going to make myself sick trying to eat it and true friends would understand that.

This. I went to a Coco's, which had shutdown a few months after we went, and there was a long dark hair in my Alfredo toward the bottom of the bowl. I told the waiter and they called over their manager who said I probably put it in there because it was not hers or the waiters and the cook didn't have long hair. I had red hair at the time. I was already cranky and tired because I had gotten out of work and I also had just thrown up because seeing someone else's hair in the food I just ate half of made me super nauseous. We paid for our meal and were offered a slice of pie before we left because “their kitchen was closed and we can't make anymore food"". I just wanted to leave. I was already fighting off tears and a breakdown from stress at work and the situation. My husband felt so bad. Lol If they had just owned up to their mistake it wouldn't have been as bad but them calling me a liar when I clearly didn't shove a hair into the bottom of the dish on top of puking was the tip of the iceberg that day.

When I was younger, someone called CPS on my mom and she was told by the social workers that my brother and I needed to have separate rooms. We are a year apart and we were about 9 and 10. This was in California in the late 90s to early 2000s. I guess it all depends on the person who actually goes out and is checking on families.

I was debating on doing my own makeup for my wedding but a friend of mine made a great point he said, “you'll have enough to worry about that day let alone trying to get your makeup right yourself. “ My makeup was gifted by my amazing mother in law but it was worth it. I just had to sit there, try to relax from wedding day jitters and not worry about anything like why my wings aren't coming out straight. Lol Someone also did my hair. I know myself and how frustrated I get when I'm trying to do something perfect so it helped a lot.
All the women I've known in my lifetime have gotten their makeup done professionally.

I tip after they come usually in cash because our food has been stolen way too many times. I've had a woman driver answer my call when she completed my order and pretend she couldn't hear me when I was trying to ask where she was because we didn't get our food. I could hear myself echoing on her end over her speaker. She hung up on me and declined my calls after that. It was an expensive order so I guess her greed got the best of her.
If you don't accept my order, that's totally fine but I'm not tipping until after what I paid for gets to my house and in my hands.

I am worried this will be my brother. My brother has crippling anxiety. He is going to be 23 soon, he just quit his job of 6 years because of his anxiety, he has quit school 2 times, and now he’s on academic probation.
It’s been very hard for him, but it has always been really hard for my family, especially for my mother. I hope he can find his way in life because he can’t live with our parents forever.

See my neuroscience program isn’t like that. We never had to memorize pathways (except for Biochemistry class). i had to take a 4 credit neuroscience research methods class where we had preform PCR, western blots, cell splitting, cell staining, mouse brain slicing and staining, microscopy, etc. That class was the hardest class I have ever taken.
My curriculum is also missing coding. Although they introduce R in biology II lab and you practice with excel is statistics. But yeah, that’s It’s not enough.
I think that a lot of people do not know what studying neuroscience is really like because it’s so interdisciplinary. Definitely look deeply into the classes and program before applying.

Hi Kale it’s me. I’m going to be a senior in college soon! Crazy, right?
I was going to apply for a PhD in molecular neuroscience this fall, and well.. I realize that I absolutely hate bench work. I might look into more clinical/psychology side of neuroscience, but as right now I’m not pursuing a PhD nor do I have any desire to go to medical school.
Luckily, my parents are very supportive of this decision. I’m sorry that you’re parents are pushing you to keep pursuing a higher education. You’re so smart and young, Kale.

Hi Kale it’s me. I’m going to be a senior in college soon! Crazy, right?
I was going to apply for a PhD in molecular neuroscience this fall, and well.. I realize that I absolutely hate bench work. I might look into more clinical/psychology side of neuroscience, but as right now I’m not pursuing a PhD nor do I have any desire to go to medical school.
Luckily, my parents are very supportive of this decision. I’m sorry that you’re parents are pushing you to keep pursuing a higher education. You’re so smart and still young, Kale. Stick to your gut and have faith in yourself.

If mentally ill means permanent to you, then no. The happy news is that is recoverable. With the right mood stabillizer, and giving yourself the chance to reboot, it is something generally obatained by severe stress plus how you respond to things. OptimisticOptimistic.

What does it mean when someone tells you they love you in a dream?
I had a few dreams about the same guy id been in love with since the day i met him. But after a while one night after we got closer and closer i slept and dreamnt of being beside him in bed(where i was with him 3hrs earlier) and he told me he Loved me. I yearned to hear those words for years. The only dream i ever had with him saying it. I do believe it was a yearn, because id held onto the idea of him opening up to me for years.

I was abused sexually as a child by mother and her drug addict friends. I enjoyed and loved it. My father was mean and would beat me badly so whatever my mother had to give me I wanted it. The bad thing is my mind has ducked things up and now I have a deep hatred not for the ones who turned me out but those who knew and left me in the house they be tortured.

A little backstory about me. I’m a 45 year old man who has never been married. Im terrible with women and dating and relationships have never come easy to me and they never last. I’m always rejected. I am clearly a horrible human being if no woman wants to give me a chance at a relationship. But I’m trying to fix this and have been pouring lots of resources in. I got a big job promotion recently with a big raise and pouring more money and time into self help books and courses, therapy, and hiring a dating coach and a life coach and hiring a spiritual reiki coach and I’m calling the pastoral team to help me fix things just in case it’s simply just God hating me too much to help me get a girlfriend. I’m even pouring in lots of money to update my wardrobe and I’ve bought pheromone scented colognes and soaps and lotions and hygiene products which are supposed to alter my body chemistry to where it sends out chemical signals to nearby women telling them that I’m slightly more attractive than I actually am. I joined weight watchers and I get up at 4am to work out and have lost 60 pounds. I put off taking my own life to give all this a chance. But if it fails in a few years, I truly will know society is better off without me. After all, if no woman can fall in love with me and see me as husband and boyfriend material, then it means I’m a horrible human being with nothing to offer. Just look all the happy couples around and I see all kinds of guys who can walk up a woman and never get rejected. While I’m always rejected. I’ll be talking to my therapist and the pastoral team at my church before ending things. But before I take my life in a few years, how should I get my affairs in order before taking my own life? What advice can you give me?
This is a very heavy post! OK, first off, having a physical ailment doesn't mean that God, or anyone else, hates you; this includes palpitations at bedtime! You are investing in improving yourself thru therapy, self-help, dietary changes, exercise and spirituality. Adressing your health so holistically will improve your mood, appearance and life in general. These are all wonderful things! Make sure that you also do the activities you love. Fall in love with life, first. As for your nightly palpitations, there are many possibilities. You need to work with a general practitioner to determine if there is a physical cause for this malady. Your primary care practitioner (PCP) can help you by ordering initial tests, diagnostics and specialist referrals, like blood work, electrocardiograms and card…

People sometimes make mistakes. Regardless, this was not an “oops, I colored outside the lines” mistake. This was a series of poor choices that lead to you betraying a sacred vow in a heinous way. You need to be honest about your transgression, and take the consequences of your actions. If that means family counseling and doing everything necessary to rebuild trust with the husband you harmed, then you'll be lucky. More than likely, you've caused irreparable damage to your relationship.

I’m glad your nurse focused on the baby, and that you have a daughter who survived so healthily. I don’t believe this god complex is unique to male doctors. Most doctors do want to help as many as possible; unfortunately they become inured to the plight of humanity watching so many deaths and trying to focus on saving as many lives as possible amongst the stupidity and harshness of humankind.

Details: Both myself and my friend grew up very poor and homeless at times. We were incredibly close as teens, but parted ways in high school. She chose drugs and partying, I chose to enter the military and then pursued a career in healthcare. We came together again several years ago and have maintained a less-close relationship as adults.
I have tried to be helpful to her when my own finances allowed. I've supported her at times monetarily, and took her middle child under wing to provide several opportunities. I've never expected much in return, just friendship, and the hope that the little I could give might help her keep a job or build her confidence.
To be met with such an ugly statement hurts. I don't understand why she would gleefully wager on my potential suffering.

What would you do? I am 44F, and a relatively successful RN. I recently learned that one of my lifelong friends 47F was making bets with her boyfriend 45M that the man 36M I'm engaged to would drain me of my finances and leave me penniless.

So today I came to school with my shirt tucked in, and like almost everyone that passed me in the hallway stared at my tucked shirt. I felt so self conscious. I don’t really have a belly though. What’s going on?
Maybe, in your school others dont tuck in.
Or maybe you were so conscious that yu may be over thnkng that all eyes r on u. Acc to social psychology we tend to thnk that ppl r looking at us more than they actually r

What should I do? I am 34 years old, unemployed, single, I live with my old parents, I have social anxiety, I am afraid to go out. I have no money for medication and for the therapist. My English is not good to work online, no one is helping me.
First of all, Do not put yourself down and Do not compare yourself to others as that would break your confidence. 1. Upgrade your communication skill * Learn English and improve speaking skills as that would give you a competitive advantage and will land you a decent job as that's would make it easier for you to climb the corporate ladder. 2. Be Confident (if not fake it till you make it) * The technique to being confident is to try to recall any of your previous achievements that you have to endeavour, doesn't matter whether it's small or big. You have to be in that moment of achievement that you have achieved. As this would give you the “let's do it” kinda things and by this, you would be able to make the first impression as the best impression. 3. Try to make friends/meet more people * It's hard somet…

It is not the oppressed's responsibility to educate the oppressor. It is inappropriate and triggering to be asked to educate those whom hurt us.
However, I'll give you this: Our disdain for men is not a generalization based on one bad interaction. Our disdain (or more accurately, the need to protect ourselves) arises from years and years of perpetual and pervasive misogyny and interactions with men who feel they can dominate us. The effect is cumulative. You are a member of a population who has done a lot of damage and continues to oppress women. We would rather feel safe and live harmoniously with all of human-kind, but most of us have not had positive experiences with men (often starting with our fathers and brothers) and are now in self-preservation mode. No one is looking out for us. We have to do it for ourselves. Hell, we even have to fight misogyny within our own sex and gender!! Yes, many of us have become hypervigilant, but for numerous valid reasons.
So, rather than asking what is wrong with women/the oppressed, ask what is wrong with men/the oppressor and the society that breeds this corruption. You are not the victim here.

What should I do about my brother refusing to invite me to his wedding because I haven’t gotten the vaccine?
You should either get vaccinated so you can attend, or stay home.
What answer are you looking for here? Permission from strangers on the internet to breach your brothers trust and wishes by attending unvaccinated?

The only thing I would disagree with here is the overgeneralisation that chihuahuas and other small breeds are “never” suitable for families with kids. It’s just not true.

ok so I have been talking to my boyfriend for 5 months and we just started officially dating about two months ago. When we first started talking I was unsure if I wanted to be with him; however we would speak constantly. There were two instances before we started dating where we fought and he insulted me and blamed me for his bad actions. Eventually we began dating and since then he has not done anything bad or been mean to me. The other day I caught him looking through my messages him. I confronted him and he promised to never do that again and said he only did it be he wasn’t my number one best friend on Snapchat. My boyfriend also insists he sees me every single day and texts me all the time. He gets upset when I suggest that I sleep alone. He insists on driving me to class and picking me up (although I do appreciate not having to take the bus). He offers to pay for everything and buy me the world. I’m just not sure if this is normal or cause for worry.

What are the symptoms of anxiety?
When you overthink and it leads to inaction. That’s anxiety in its most basic form. Giving yourself time to think before doing is a good thing. But when overdone then it becomes a counterproductive, unhealthy mental habit that feeds your fears until you realize you don’t want to do it anymore. All of a sudden you’ve created ‘imaginary problems’ in your head which makes it more difficult for you to move forward. “What if they don’t like me? / But I’m so awkward / I might be terrible at it.” The antidote: Conscientiousness. “The mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.” (Robin Sharma) Discipline your mind. Do not let it work on its own. When you are aware of your own thoughts you can learn to stop overthinking at will. Like any mastery, it’ll take deliberate practice, but it is one of t…

So then why do people criticize Jews for being adamant about not allowing Palestinians to have equal voting rights? I'm sure they're afraid what happened to Lebanon will happen in Israel and it will eventually become Arab Muslim majority.
I live as a minority in the US and honestly speaking, I pray it stays secular as a Christian majority country even if I'm a South Asian Hindu minority. I don't want it to be Muslim majority in the very distant future or ever. If that happens, I feel the secular nature of the country will disappear.
I don't see Arab Muslim majority nations accommodating non-Muslim views on secularism or laws of the land. All Muslim majority countries, for the most part, try to be as Islamic as possible, so I wonder why Non-Muslim majority countries are so quick to accommodate sharia law and lose their secular nature.

Do some men hate feminism? If so, why?
The primary reason I know why feminism is hated by anti-feminists is that the anti-feminists feel that feminists are asking for special privileges for women. The special privileges feminists want for women are the rights men have enjoyed for centuries: access to work, property ownership, control of their own bodies, voting rights, wage equality… the list goes on, but it pretty much boils down to equality with men under the law. For anti-feminists, these equal rights are special rights. This is not the case for feminists.

How come Indian Supermarkets like Patel Brothers and Apna Bazaar sell beef and other meat products when they have pooja items and murtis sold in there markets? At same point the workers who stock the beef and other meats could also stock pooja items.
Indians or South Asians aren't just Hindu, they come in all different religions and subcultures some of which don’t have any issues with beef and other meats. Sadly, Indians have no knowledge about other religions and subcultures of India.
When it comes to a business, religion and political views don’t decide what is sold or offered by the business. Plus, Patel Brothers doesn’t just cater to Indians, they also cater to Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are majority Muslims.

I've been struggling with a similar issue. I love my fiance so much but im starting to realize I'm more attracted to women.
.I decided to stay with him because I do still love him weve been together for 9 years and I do have an attraction for him still. If you feel like you don't have any strong romantic feelings for him its better that you end it so that you can both find someone you can truly love

What attracts introverted men?
Introverts are attracted by things that do not interfere with their personality in any way. An introvert would be glad to spend time with less talkative person who does not disturb him/her with noise. So, socially introverts prefer nerds as friends. In a relationship, an intro would want to be associated with a person who is secretive, low profile and who likes indoor fun. Although introverts are not anxious in public settings, they have great tendency to make use of their own time without mingling with the external world. Such tendency may create boredom or loneliness and thus an introvert still would be willing to have a gf or bf whom he can spend quality time with.

Where I'm from, neither glass or alcohol are allowed on the beach. I think this “hack” is saying to switch out the Listerine and vodka, and give the vodka good coloring so it looks like Listerine — basically, it’s how to sneak alcohol onto the beach with minimal risk of getting caught.

This was all too interesting not to comment. INFJ here, just to specify. It really sounds like you’re just arguing about the logical fallacies of using specific cognitive functions while de-valuing others. Of course an INTP has a problem with an INFJ using Ni- INTP’s devalue it!
Let me compare this to a mathematics analogy (I’ve got a masters in pure math- and we’re talking about thought algorithms). To me, INTP’s thinking is kind of like a proof using induction, one step building to the next until the conclusion has been reached- like going up the stairs, one step at a time. That’s fantastic- very logical. If you wanted to prove 2 million was even, you could count up by 2’s until you reach it. QED- Fantastic. Or you could notice the pattern (Ni)- that it’s in the form of 2n. Much quicker way to reach a conclusion. In this analogy, the inductive proof (INTP) will most times be correct (yes- you’re human, you make mistakes too), but it takes forever, and they can’t even reach some conclusions. Finding the pattern will usually be correct, but of course the chance for constructing an erroneous pattern is higher. The trade-off being that INFJs can also reach conclusions more quickly, which has value in itself- especially for dealing with people in the present moment or theorizing ideas in general. INTP’s also need enough valid data to even reach their conclusions at all. Here I might compare INFJ’s to using a telescoping type proof to fix that problem. (It’s partially a judger vs perceiver preference difference too).
My long time best friend, whom I adore, is an INTP (female); the person that I spent the most time with this year is an INTP (male). I truly love how consistent you all are. But- your social skills lack! I’ve had to bail you guys out so many times. Inferior Fe, and polar Se- you’ve not got a strong a sense of the social aspects going on around you. You barely (if at all) notice when you are being offensive, so why would you notice when others are? An INFJ can hardly NOT notice it (Ni-Fe).
Plus, just because an INTJ says that they wanted to be mean to the kid because he looked like Joeffrey, doesn’t mean that the INFJ will devise their feelings the same way. It’s Fe-Ti axis vs Te-Fi axis. Decisions just aren’t made the same. You, who is on the same axis as the INFJ for decision making, didn’t mention feeling the desire to be mean to this kid- rather you liked him for what he did (being a hoot- Ti-Fe). This is because Fe-Ti axis makes decisions based on how the person is treating others (Fe) and that is basically aided by whatever subjective logic frame is built up in the person’s mind (Ti). INTJ was probably right about their own vendetta (Fi) showing up in their feelings about the kid. INTJ’s are endearing like that.
Also, the kid really may have been a jerk before that and you simply didn’t notice. Kid’s behaviors do 180’s so much (lots of great neuroplasticity). Also, some kids behave better for men, and some behave better for women. It’s a pattern that I’ve had many of my teacher friends tell me about- and noticed myself too. My money is on her having some information (probably picked up via Fe-Se) that you didn’t about the kid.
In sum, saying that INFJ’s are illogical just because they don’t use the same “Proof type” as you is a bit irresponsible. If I tried to only use inductive proofs, there would be a whole lot of things that I simply couldn’t do. Additionally, INTP’s subconsciously use a lot of Ni too (socionics). So your logic structures are built on your subjective thinking (Ti) and your subjective experiences (Si) with a swift undercurrent of subjective intuition (Ni) to boot. What I’m saying is, your logic is very subjective to your personal experiences- just as INFJ’s gut feelings are subjective to their own experiences. This really seems like the pot calling the kettle black. You really hate people going along with their gut feelings because you devalue Ni.
Every type has its thinking flaws, INTP’s are no different. To say that the “sore thumb” of an INFJ is a thinking flaw is kind of… it’s just your personal preference! Everyone has a thinking flaw! I think that you got the intent of the question incorrect too. Did you answer the question? Yes. Did you just answer it with a complaint that INTP’s have against anyone who doesn’t value Ti above all else? Yes.
On a side note, guess what type of mathematics problems that I had to assist INTP’s with? Ones involving patterns (Ni)! =)
Feel free to counter any of this. I wouldn’t mind clarifying certain points. I realize that I can sometimes jump from A to C, but skip mentioning B.

Why would someone who cheated on you, and after you left them, they found new awesome partner very soon (and they kinda liked comparing this new partner to you), contacts you occasionally even after a year, while still having this new relationship?
He's a narcissist, wants to keep you on a string so you'll be available if and when the new girl figures out he is evil. He feeds off your attention and the comparisons between you are a classic behavior. :(

Every pet I've ever had has slept in my bed, usually under the covers. Some of them even like to lay their heads on the pillow. Currently we have 3 small dogs and they are no exception. Nugget likes to burrow under they covers and snuggle alongside my back or belly. Millie likes to stay on top of the covers at the foot of the bed or up on a pillow between my husband and myself. Beau, the baby, sprawls on top of one or the other of our chests or heads even.. They keep us warm and derive comfort and security from being close to us. I would never have it any other way.

❤️ hang in …just keep holding on, hold on through the pain, even when it feels like it will never end, because it is a cycle, exactly as you said. I sometimes forget that myself. That's why it's so important to reach out to others wunderstand, like you are here. Because this life of manic highs and lows can at times cause us such deep anguish that we just want to get off the roller coaster. But, remember, it's all a wild ride and we are just a turn or a hill away from the next ecstatic joy. Even if it's brief moments, you will feel joy. Pain, after breaking us down, builds us up. It's just more dramatic for those of us who suffer depression. I'm holding on with you. ❤️❤️❤️

When Frontline plus stopped working for our dogs (after 15 years of excellent flea and tick control) we tried 4 other top spot treatments and ended up finding the most cost effective and almost total eradication of fleas with seresto collars. Purchased directly from authorized dealers only. There are a LOT of counterfeits out there and they can be dangerous.

What are some tips for keeping a journal of your therapy sessions?
That’s a great question and one that is such an individual process so take what I offer with a grain of salt. One thing to consider before taking notes may be asking yourself “what makes me want to journal in the first place?” So that you can get an idea of what structure and ideas you may have about the direction of journalling you’re headed in. For example, have you agreed with your therapist some exercise aims that might take a more structured, day-by-day journal shape, or if you are working more fluidly and often tap into the depths of your imagination, perhaps you’d try using a big blank journal where you can scribble notes and layer magazine images or colour drawings. If you’ve got an idea of what type of journal you’re drawn to, another question would be “what is holding or what would…

Why would someone stop therapy suddenly in the middle of their sessions without telling their therapist?
This strikes me as a question about what is unsaid between therapist and client. I’m imagining a client who regularly attends therapy and perhaps all’s going well on paper but one day towards the middle of their contracted relationship, they leave all of a sudden, no email, no voice message, nothing. Getting the obvious out of the way first; clients can face uncontrollable financial difficulties, physical or geographic circumstances etc. but I get the sense you’re wondering about what may cause a client to intentionally leave therapy. In that respect I’m drawn to the idea of rupture and repair in that particular therapy relationship. For example: * C: “A is bothering me because I feel B” * T: “Ok so A is bothering you because of X” * C: “No no… X has nothing to do with it, I feel B.” * T: “Well B might j…

Hi, thanks for the great post! It was incredible informative :) Just wondering, what city did you end up moving to in the UK?
My partner and I are actually living in London but looking to move due to the high crime rates here (and looking for more accessibility to greenery), so are weighing options to move to somewhere else in the the UK such as Edinburgh or Bristol with its supposed better quality of life.

For me, it's not emotional expression in itself that is off-putting. I agree that in a film, performance, piece of music, an authentic moment between friends or spouses, emotion can be deeply moving and even an INTP can get misty eyed, and have genuine empathy.
When people become irrationally or plain unhinged emotional, that's when I disconnect and want to run away and disengage. There's something about immature emotional expression like whining, dramatic flair for attention that comes off manipulative and disingenuous that is also really off-putting.
It's not that we run from emotions, or never feel any. I know I feel very intense/deeply but I'm definitely guarded with it. Showing emotion denotes vulnerability and I also get easily flustered when emotion is high. I don't like feeling out of control.

I enjoy these writing moments. You're hardly feeling as if you're “working” when you're in the flow and the characters have essentially hijacked you as their conduit to get themselves onto the page. Part of the occasional magic, in my humble opinion.

I believe that many of the comments here are very helpful. Probably much more so than what I'm about to say.
As a woman (and a writer of fiction, including some spicy works) I would only like to offer up this, perhaps it might be helpful: If you're writing from a female POV or just wanting to understand more about female perception, women are very sensitive to scent. In my own writing work, I personally draw a lot on the sense of smell and describe these things, also the tactile and even the sound/timbre/volume of a voice. They are aspects of “sexual attraction” that can be quite powerful. Though, I am a very sense oriented person in general. I can only write/speak from my experience.
Hope it can be a little useful, however, the other comments suggesting having a trusty female to assist, or a writer's circle is excellent.

What are the ghouls in Fallout?
They are human beings who were affected by high levels of radiation that mutated them into the crispy, husky-voiced characters we find in the game such as Hancock, Jason Bright, Bobbi No-Nose, Dean Domino and others. They achieve an almost immortality as ghouls exist from the Pre War Era and you will meet them in the various games. Their aging process is slowed significantly from the radiation mutations that occur. Ghouls typically kept settlements of their own and lived among one another in societies (Necropolis, Underworld) because all ghouls will eventually become feral but the rate at which that transformation occurs varies from Ghoul to Ghoul. Because of this eventuality, Ghouls will live among ferals and attempt to keep them from the rest of the wasteland population. Ghouls retain the…

What did Kellogg mean in Fallout 4 when he said ""I'm just a puppet like you""?
My personal interpretation is probably the most obvious; You’re both being manipulated by The Institute. He knows the truth about Shaun but at that point in the game, you do not. He was used by The Institute for at least, approx. 100 years and you were lead to him. It can be read as a warning.
Or, you can interpret it as a hint to the “Sole Survivor is a Synth” theory.
You be the judge.

Do you believe all addictions have the same root cause?
The short answer is No. I have met opiate addicts who had lived relatively “normal"", stable, well adjusted lives and due to some unforeseen incident such as a car accident, cancer diagnosis, physical injury, etc. were prescribed narcotics and after a time of taking them found themselves addicted. There IS a distinction between physical dependence and addiction however. But there can also be a crossover where one might have begun as physically dependent and then began acting out addiction behavior such as theft, secrecy, lying about intake, doing anything to access that substance, etc. . Then you have addicts who experienced abuse, trauma, chronic shame/neglect or were people who were by temperament or personality more curious and risk-taking or had impulse control issues and gravitated towar…

If God loves us, why doesn’t he give us what we want?
This answer may seem a bit simplistic and vague, even but I always understood it this way: God expects us to depend and rely on him with love and trust that his Will for us is greater than we can understand in the moment. He does not hand out wishes, like a magic genie in a bottle or a fairy godmother. He wants us to learn, grow and seek him in all we do. That requires faith. Faith in God means surrendering our will for his. Whatever that may be, whether we understand or no.

Without context it is a little hard to advise. Are your errors with social interactions, is it work tasks or is it family? Do you have addictions or a medical condition that makes focusing difficult? Age is the normal way with dealing with things if you can learn from your mistakes.
Thank you very much for the reply. Sorry english isn’t my first language but I am trying my best to clarify. The errors that I made are usually in social interactions and doing simple activities.
In social interactions, I sometimes fail to understand a simple command. And overcomplicate a simple instruction. I am trying to think in a simple way but still it is so hard. Like when my dad asked me to do A+B, but I do A+F+I+Z instead..
When I solve math problems, I overcomplicate an easy math problem. Strangely, I solve the hard problem faster than the easy one. That is so ironic
And I also make other dumb mistakes like: dropping a tray, picking up wrong trolley in supermarket, drinking wrong coffee in Starbucks. I know it is embarassing. But when I made such mistakes, i felt as if my MIND was not connected to the REALITY. As a result, no matter how much I tried to focus and anticipated any possible mistake, I still ended up making the mistakes.

1984 is one of my favorite books ever. The best part in this book I think is the part from “The Book” which describes the politics behind the eternal wars and the society manipulation. It's easier to control people when they're ignorant and living in constant fear.
Also the speech of O'Brien is so important: Power is not a tool for making justice and progress like many people think. Power is a goal and one doesn't get power to give it away.
Finally, Orwell insisted on the importance of language. You cannot think straight with poor linguistic knowledge. You cannot talk about “Freedom” if there's no word as “Freedom” in the dictionary.
I guess there's more to learn from 1984 than what I've mentioned above.

Do you always unconsciously sit on the edge of the chair because your legs can’t fully rest on the floor?
As someone who is barely 5 foot (that is 150 cm for you intelligent people), I can surely say that I always sit on the edge of the chair when my legs can’t rest on the floor
Some exceptions is when there are ledge on the chair or table (I don’t know if this is the correct term, I mean the bar between chair or table legs to rest your feet upon), only then can I sit comfortably.

Can being a people pleaser make you a toxic person?
Definitely.
Imagine a people pleaser stuck in between two opposing sides. She will try her best to be diplomatic, avoid confrontation, and please both sides. When that is not possible, she will eventually resort to deception, or other negative things just to avoid being disliked by either side. If deception is not toxic then I don’t know what is.

Not every culture makes out death as the horrific tragedy. Some even celebrated it, which quite make sense since death is natural and will happen to everyone. For the Torajans in Indonesia,

What is the biggest misnomer of historical figures?
In Indonesian history, there are many famous historical figures, here are some of them:
Gajah Mada, directly translated, “Gajah” means “Elephant” in Indonesia. And no, our famous hero is not an Elephant.
Hayam Wuruk, which literally translates to “An Educated Chicken” (no, I am serious). Again, he is not a chicken, though I assume he must be well educated as a King.
Orang Kayo Hitam, he is just my favorite hero, how could you not love a “Rich Black Man”. This is not racist, this is just Indonesian history.
There are others, but these are some of my favorite historical figures misnomers which have puzzled me since elementary school. I don’t know about the biggest though.

How do you wish good morning to your lover?
I am Asian, so we don’t. Not really. What is even the point of saying good morning, to someone you love or not? More importantly, are there even such things as good mornings? If you are like me, you start your morning dreading your work and job for the day. Doesn’t matter that my house is filled with people I love, there is no such thing as a “good morning”. On that note, to answer your question, really a grunt or simple “hey” is enough to start the day, anything more will take too much of my energy.
People you love will love you anyway!

What is the first thing you will notice once you cut toxic people out of your life?
I felt like that weird, friendless, lonely kid. Because from my experience, those toxic people are everywhere and everyone. They can be the popular crowd or the not-so-popular crowd. I used to think only popular kids are mean, they talk about people behind their backs and made fun of them. But I have known some ugly and not popular people be as toxic as those popular kids, because they want to drag others down and make themselves look better. Those cliches about how the pretty women are dumb and the nerds are super kind? NOT TRUE AT ALL. If you cut toxic people out of your life, you will find that there is nowhere that you really belong, because everyone is at least a little bit toxic, even you yourself.

Why do some people have wanderlust and not others?
I suppose different kind of people will have different reasons for having wanderlust. For me personally, my wanderlust is a result from my urge to run away from my current situation. I feel as though currently all my family and friends and colleagues and the strangers have all become too familiar and too much. By being too familiar, I no longer feel excited about what is to come. I know who I will meet tomorrow or the next day, so what am I supposed to be excited about? Not to mention I kept being reminded of all the past mistakes that I made everyday due to the familiar surrounding. So yeah, I would like nothing more than to just pack my bags and go somewhere foreign and be anonymous. Some reasons why some people doesn’t have wanderlust might be because they are perfectly content with wher…

At the least ,i could say personally that don't do drugs ,avoid medication ,maybe you need to question your being .being, i tell you this as a one medicated for so long ,(long enough to cover two decades) ,so what I advised is more precious than doctor's medication,in my thinking psychiatry is probably pseudoscience ,and when I delve into depths of reasoning ,i could easily say the so-called “doctors” are only the gatekeepers of capitalism ,at the end if you dare to question so-called “human civilization” ,you could see that all had been ,was ,is a “SCAM”.

I'm on the verge of taking my life. How can I say goodbye without hurting anyone?
Guys, life isn't for everyone. I've suffered for 3 years and now it's becoming unbearable. Why me ? I didn't choose to be like this. Telling me it'll be better won't help. You don't understand until you've gone through it. I'm tired of the sleepless nights and of the overwhelming thoughts. I just want to say goodbye without people feeling guilty and with questions unanswered. I don't want them to feel as bad as I do. Why me ? Why ? I just wish that you guys don't ever feel like this. There's so much for you to go forward. God bless you all.

How do you say ""relentless"" in Arabic?
I would say that it depends heavily on the context. The Online Cambridge Dictionary mentions the word قاس (Qaas)
In another place دَؤوب (daʼūb) is mentioned to signify never ending!

Yes, especially if he worked hard! I wish the grades we get in touch could reflect the level of success we get later in life but they really don’t. Perhaps his area of interests lie somewhere else. Just encourage him to keep trying hard and tell him that hard work is the only thing that truly matters.

Why are some people ashamed of their parents?
This answer is going to be a bit disjointed/emotional/to the point. I’m turning 30 this year. I was raised by my grandparents since the age of seven. I don’t call my mother mom, I refer to her by her name, because she was not my mother, my grandmother took on that role. I just got married last year and she wasn’t invited. I don’t regret this decision. I had to tell my family members to hide the fact that I’m getting married (which wasn’t too difficult, I’m the only child and there were only three family members of mine attending the wedding). Reasons behind this decision: I’m not comfortable around her, I have no relationship with her, she can’t control herself around alcohol and would surely make a fool of herself and ruin my wedding, she’s bizarre and childish, unable to hold an adult con…

thanks for your feedback! I actually wanted to point this out. I've had friends that said they recovered from a mental illness, but trying to remember what it was like before they felt better as they do right now seems blurry or foggy to them. I don't really ask a lot about it because I don't want to bother them, and maybe this could happen or could be seen as a coping mechanism like you said. In my case, I was diagnosed with depression and OCD two years ago, but I also can't recall what I've felt. When I talk with my mom about it and she asks me what was like having OCD and depression…I just don't know what to say, I get lost in my thoughts. I'm currently feeling better but sometimes I still feel like I used to before, OCD it's hard to control but I try. (btw, sorry I'm not a native English speaker:( my grammar can be a bit off) but thank you once again! :3

I have come to this conclusion as well. As far as not being into a relationship. I end up really hurting the people that I love or I end up hurting so bad that I can’t function. I believe that being alone is best for me. Not feeling alone, living in a happy solitude. Lol

I’m 52 and recently separated from a 27 year marriage. I had never lived alone. I moved into my own apartment. While I missed my home for a couple of months, I now come to my apartment and smile. I can not imagine sharing my space with anyone ever again. All that you say is true. Especially having the bed to yourself. Lol. Maybe someday I will look for another person to share my life with but right now it’s a big nope.

I have a 20 year old Asd son. He practically lives in his bedroom. He goes to work, comes home, goes to his bedroom. We have to pull conversation from him. I saw that you said that this type of behavior makes you happy. I struggle with accepting that my son is happy. He seems happy enough but I still worry. Please tell me, are you really truly happy with being alone and going to work? I just want my son to be happy and if this makes him happy, I’ll stop trying to force interaction with him or between him and others. Thank you.

This hits home for me. I’ve been estranged from my father for five years. He’s and alcoholic and uses crack. He has a violent temper and assaults people around him. I chose to cut ties with him. One day I had the oddest feelings. It took me about two weeks to realize that I was missing him. The way he used to be. The way he will never be again. When he used to sing to me and play jokes and laugh. He is still alive but he is so unsafe for my family and myself to be around. I dread the day he passes away because I know there will be guilt. Also some people give me a hard time and judge me for not taking care of him. He is homeless. Anyway thank you for writing this.

I dated a guy that would act out his dreams. Slap at the air, get up and throw furniture around, cuss himself out in the mirror. If I got his attention he would yell in my direction but look right through me. It was terrifying.

I absolutely know I'm depressed, but I don't want to get ""undepressed"" again. I don't get a sense in life, but also don't know why I should end it. Can I do anything about it?
I think it's called hopelessness. You don't really want to die but you can't think of a good reason to live either.

What are your top five suggestions for getting out of depression?
Get up . Get out of the house. Walk around the block. Sit at a coffe shop, be around people. Getting up and out is the hardest part but it helps so much.

I am sorry about a few of the answers. ——————————— What you are feeling is completely normal. It is a side effect of anxiety. I know, the word anxiety is scary- but there is no need to fear. There is a word for what you are feeling. It is called depersonalisation or derealisation. They are words that describe a feeling of a more dreamlike world, one that is out of your hands. It may feel as if you are observing someone else’s actions that are not your own. Here is a link that will help you understand anxiety and depersonalisation more.

Definitely show them the facial expressions of your suffering. It also helps if you're very interactive and affectionate (to their desired level, of course 😂). I have a beautiful 6 and a half month old male ginger tabby, and he's so beautifully sensitive and affectionate to my needs, very much a reciprocation of how I am and have been to him since I got him at 5 weeks - he even “protects” me when my partner is away 😭 he's my lil ginger angel-muffin😍❤️ best wishes to you with yours 🙏💗

I can see how you got there, but I think it's more of a “show me what you'd body likes and responds to so I can please you better”
Obviously some things will be the same as exes past but that's not to say that this husband will become kme like them to her or in her eyes, you know? Sex is a lot of repetition of the same kinda of actions if you think about it. Its the personal association I guess that would make it “like her exes”. I personally would argue maybe there's something deeper if the wife feels the need to express herself like so to her husband. To quote other lovers as better - what reason does that serve, I cannot imagine a world where that would be used to positively influence change in your partner though.

I strongly suggest a new therapist or breaking off the relationship — efforts to fix it yourselves haven't worked and professional help isn't working. Either your therapist is incompetent or trying to suck money out of you cause surely they'd be able to see a mile away if people aren't compatible and the like and it's their job to tell said people.

I think you are so amazing and empowering to both NT and autistics. Have you ever thought about going into counseling or starting some sort of advice/support program? Your level of introspection is comforting. I am the mom to an amazing son, who has so many amazing qualities. He is high functioning on the ASD. Unfortunately, he doesnt seem to see all the wonderfulness that I do. I can only imagine how hard this must be. I Very much try to let him be him, engage in his intrests, and support him. We are very close. He can have huge meltdowns and doesnt see the value in school. Hes a senior and it is everything I can do to get him through. This is the area we clash.
If you were to give advice to parents on how to best support their high functioning autistic child, what would you say?

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. You don't know how valuable they are to parents of children who are on the spectrum. My son is high functioning and Is so creative, out of the Box smart, hysterically funny And such a gift to this world. He doesnt see that or wont accept that. How do I help him to see these talents? I can tell him, but I'm just mom. I want him to believe in himself more. Do you have any suggestions on how to build that selfesteem. My heart hurts for him because I know hes going through so many extra issues that are not typical. Regulating his emotions and the way he reacts to things are very extreme and I know he knows that. Social skills and anxiety play a huge role. He can tell you how to handle situations but when they actually occur it leaves his brain. He has a therapist and an autisim itinerant. Is there anything that really helped you? You are so very articulate and really seem to understand your emotions. To me that seems like half the battle, trying to get him to explain why hes upset And how to take a pause when he is upset.Any advice would be great because the way you just explained things was so spot on. How do we let our children know just how wonderful they are and it's actually the rest the world thats not as fortunate as them. I am constantly reading to him about famous people in the world that have made Life changing inventions or ideas. Most of those people are on the autism spectrum. We need people on the autism spectrum to enhance our lives.!

I'm on the fence here. My mother didn't spend shit on us, do much for us, and mentally fucked us up. Lucky if we got government powdered milk and cornflakes. Stole tampons and clothes, etc for myself among other things. Yes she barely kept a roof over our heads but I can't recall if that was the whole time we were mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually(men in her life) abused. She deserves nothing if she ever found out my drug addicted sperm donors name and managed to get back pay..fuck that

Today, started out to be a completely normal day, except for the news which turned it into not so normal.
My husband stays awake all night because he is a PHD student and its very difficult for him to continue his work from home while the baby is awake.I mean, he still works during the day, but the efficency reduces greatly with the baby jumping and running all over the place, especially when he spot a laptop on his father’s lap and shout with all his might, OOOOON.
So today, after feeding my baby, I prepared his breakfast with smile plastered on my face. Its kind of my habbit since our marriage, I always prepare breakfast, before waking him up and he always thank for everying on the plate, even though the paratha(bread) doesn't even look like paratha. He said the same thing he has said zillion of times before.
Jaan, ap ny tou kamal kr dia. Ap bht achi hen.
Life or soul(referring to me), you have done wonders, you are so good.
And then he showed me an email from his professor which left me shocked or worried. He was moving somewhere else and can no longer support his new phd students anymore. He apologized and told my husband to keep it confidential from uni and to look somewhere else for phd.
I mean he left his job to pursue his dream of phd in ireland. Leaving me and my 8month old in home country. We were in the middle of applying our vissa. He left in sept 2019 and visited us in feb 2020 because he was missing our son so bad that he decided to take a flight to home country for just 3 days before the conference . Conference got cancelled because of covid-19 and he got stuck here because of lockdown. After lockdown he couldn't go because uni( trinity college dublin) in ireland was close and there was no point in going back there, as everything is shifted to an online system.
Back to square 1. Its 3:16am and he is sitting right beside me searching for new phd positions and i just can't seem to thank lord for blessing me with such an amazing man, who didn't complain neither to me nor to his professor. He congratulated his professor for his new position and told me for hundredth time
“hey, don't worry love. I will get a new scholarship within next 6 months, till then we have enough savings. Maybe it was for better, because this time you guys will go with me. I can't live a day without you and this little monster”.
I’m happy because I’m blessed beyond measure. I’m sad because i can't help him in this situation. I’m scared of, what if……I’m worried for the man who is standing strong for my sake but I’m in love with his calmness, politeness and belief that he will always be able to provide the best for his family.

Who told you that?. Get your facts straight. No muslim on the face of earth drink any form of animal waste, including this nonsense.
The best thing about islam is its clarity.
We are not allowed to drink wine because we have to pray 5 times a day( from the sunrise till the sunset). Wine is bound to make people lose control and no one can pray while they are drunk, hence bound to make mistakes during salah.

I was glad to see seizures mentioned as well; my flight or fight is so constantly in flight mode (I didn’t know this), any trigger can cause me to dead drop (faint, but not from lack of oxygen; just a straight drop to the floor), or worse, have a “seizure”.
My seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or PNES, look and feel like an epileptic grand mal/tonic-clonic, and a video EEG confirmed they’re not epileptic back in ‘17.
Glad to read about this.

I’ve been saying the same thing since 1994. I was a freshman in college, and will never forget that day. I have never believed it was a suicide; most people I knew who followed the band tended to agree. What I find most sad is that his death is remembered before his life. You hear ‘Kurt Cobain’, and most people think of his suicide before they remember what an amazing talent he was, how he shared his soul with his audience every night, how his lyrics could change a mood, a though, a life.
I never saw that note, thanks for sharing.

My daughter is 9, and has severe myopia for her age. She is -3.0 in her R and -4.25 in her L. We put her in contacts over the summer for convenience and to eliminate goggles for sports, and her only complaint is the occasional dry eye. Contacts may help slow myopic decline in certain pediatric patients, and her ophthalmologist was completely on board.
I should note that I am severely myopic, with astigmatisms in both eyes; I’m -9.0 in the R, -10.25 in my left, and have been in contacts since 4th grade (I’m 45). Admittedly, there have been times when we just can’t dial in a diopter/axis/base for my left eye, as it has changed over the years, and I’ve changed my desired outcome. I no longer strive for 20/20; I’m 40/60 at best, with my right eye being corrected for vision alone, while my left eye has always focused on the astigmatism first, then strength.
I have never felt disappointed, devastated, or upset about my vision…maybe a little envy when friends would get LASIK surgery and have perfect vision by the time they get home! (I’m not a candidate because I lack the corneal surface in both eyes, and refractive surgery is out of my budget and my comfort zone.)
Set an example for your child and embrace the uniqueness of wearing glasses. Don’t be their first “four-eyes” bully, please.

Contact the EEOC and file a claim. I also have a seizure disorder, and ended up losing a 17+ year career due to my employer’s knowledge of said disorder. The company made so many mistakes, it was a pretty clear case of disability discrimination, but it NEVER hurts to call.

Um…I’d remove that .onion link, like, now. Most people reading this are not accessing Quora through Tor, and here on the clearnet, your referral code isn’t anonymous.
There’s a reason this information isn’t found in an A2A on Quora. Same reason why .onion links aren’t indexed by Google…OPSEC. And yours, my friend, needs to be revised.
OP, if you know what to search for, try Reddit. And if you’re using a browser that isn’t Tor, please anonymize yourself behind a VPN until you do. Just a little friendly advice.

Neither. “Finding those papers made her day” is correct for present tense; in this example, “have/has” is unnecessary, as “made” is your verb, used with an object (day).

There is a personality disorder that can mimic OCD to the casual observer; OCPD. I’ve been diagnosed with OCPD - along with ADHD, BPD, BP, and agoraphobia w/ seizures or attacks. Here’s a link if anyone’s interested:

Productivity hack: if an email/ping/IM can be answered in <2 minutes, do it then. I am almost always awake between 3–4 (daughter is a light sleeper), and if I make the mistake of checking emails, I still follow this rule.
(I once had a manger tell me to stop emailing outside business hours because it “made her look bad”. Yeah, that's not what made her look bad…)

How hard is it to get a good GPA at Purdue?
If you do the exact opposite of what I did (change majors, skip classes, discover Everclear), then it’s not going to be easy.
Tackle college the right way, and you’ll do great. Or you’ll discover a different career path, and then do great then. Enjoy - BoilerUP!

Is there any case of dissociative identity disorder that you cannot remember the timeline of your childhood memory?
The abuse for me started when I was 2 and continued until I was 12. I don't remember much of my childhood at all. I'd say I remember maybe 25%. What I do remember are more like photographs in my head and not actual things I did. Just a picture or some vague smell that will trigger an image. Aside from that I don't remember any conversations except a few. My memories don't actually start until about 12 years old. But I do still have memory gaps when certain traumatic events have happened since then.

You get 2 wishes and no wishing for more wishes. What are they?
My first wish is that myself and everyone else in the world never has to deal with crippling mental health issues. Depression, ptsd, panic attacks, personality disorders, etc would all be knocked out without taking addictive medications.
My second wish would be to have my mom back so I could just talk to her, feel her hand holding mine, hear her voice, see her face one last time and be by her side as she passed. I didn't get to do that and it haunts me.

What has been your most memorable moment in the hospital?
When my second child was born there was a complication during her birth where she became stuck behind my pelvis. The nurse I had was an absolute dream before the pushing stage and afterwards. This nurse showed me and my family such compassion and love. I'll never forget her. I started my time with her after shift change. She was in her mid 40s and genuinely loved her job. At first her bubbly personality annoyed me while I was in pain, but I was never rude to her. She was too kind to be rude to! She stuck with me so much, always checking on me, providing me with as much assistance as I needed and she was just perfect. After the difficult delivery of my baby she came in to check on me shortly after. She stayed by my bed staring at my daughter and saying how proud she was of me for how I handle…

How did your husband react when your first child was born?
He was overwhelmed in a good way. This strong tough man turned into the most gentle person I had ever met.
The way he held her and watched her was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I've been lucky enough to witness it a second time and soon to be a 3rd time.

Perineum massage beginning 4 weeks prior to your due date can help.
Having your ob apply gentle pressure while pushing, having your OB use their fingers to gently stretch your vaginal opening while pushing.
Not pushing as hard and forcefully as possible. This allows for baby to stretch you down there instead of being shoved out.

What shocked you the most when giving birth?
A couple of things surprised me a bit.
First thing was that after your water breaks you continue to have gushes with each contraction. Nobody told me this and so I was pretty shocked when it happened with my first lol.
Second surprising thing to me was that I couldnt stop shaking after I received the epidural. I wasnt even abnormally cold, but I just couldnt control the shakes. Totally normal to experience that, but I didnt know to expect it.

Is it normal for a woman giving birth to ""tear"" down there?
I've had two babies and tore with both.
First baby was 6lbs 13oz and I needed 6 stitches.
Second baby was 9lbs 7oz and I had a 3rd degree tear that required internal and external stitches.
It's common for women to tear, but not every woman does. It depends on many factors and there are things you can do to minimize the chances of tearing.

Is pregnancy really that awful? Or is it just that one thing everyone lies about? As an anxious person, I am not sure pregnancy is the right thing for my future.
Everyone has different experiences with pregnancy and giving birth. It can be awful for some but for others it can be great. I feel like most women are honest about their experiences with pregnancy but you should keep in mind that it's so personal and doesnt mean your pregnancy would turn out the same way. My first pregnancy wasnt bad. It was pretty easy and I just dealt with the normal things like morning sickness and the uncomfortable parts like trying to figure out a comfortable sleeping position. My second pregnancy began pretty easily. I did have morning sickness for the first 4 months but after the baby began really growing I felt extremely uncomfortable. She was a large baby and took up lots of space in my stomach so naturally breathing and finding a comfortable position became tough. I…

What is something you wish people knew about pregnancy?
I wish that more people understood the discomforts of pregnancy. When a pregnant woman doesnt feel like going out, cleaning the entire house, cooking elaborate meals or what have you..it doesnt mean shes lazy.
Pregnancy comes easy for some but for others it's more difficult. My pregnancies have been difficult despite having no complications. Sometimes walking from one room to the next puts a lot of strain on my body. On top of that we go through things like months of insomnia, months of nausea and vomiting, not being able to breathe properly during the 3rd trimester and just feeling not quite like ourselves.

Has anyone had a bad experience with a therapist?
When I was 15 I was in therapy due to my issues with depression, self harm, and past trauma from sexual abuse. One of my biggest issues was my mother, which tied into all of the issues above. My mother suspected the abuse that I ensured from ages 2 till 12 and did nothing. She took me to therapy twice at 12 years old and took me out because she said I wasn't cooperating with the therapist. I was severely depressed and began self harming at 14. She only put me in therapy because my high school said in order for me to remain a student I had to see someone. Ok, so at 15 I was talking to my therapist about issues. My mother saw her alone before me for a couple minutes to explain to her that i was being difficult. When I opened up to my therapist she then told me my issues weren't my mom, but tha…

Thank you for saying this. I see so many people throwing around the word depression like it's nothing. Depression isnt just a bad day every once in a while. Depression has disrupted not only my life, but caused my loved ones pain as well. Depression alters a person to the point where they feel like they have nothing to look forward to for days, weeks, months or years on end.

Can panic attacks last for days? I have been having similar symptoms for four days and I went to the doctor and they said it was a panic attack but I have never heard of one lasting this long. It feels like my lungs aren’t inflating fully.
Short answer: yes, kind of.
More detailed answer: this happened to me after the birth of my second child. I was exhausted from lack of sleep and a hard labor. I had been home for a few weeks and was still recovering. I have panic disorder but hadn't had a panic attack since she was born. It hit me out of nowhere. Heart racing, cant catch my breath, face feeling numb, I'm dizzy, etc. I freak out thinking maybe I took too much medication by accident. I call my husband and enlist the help of my neighbor and am told to call 911. They come and check me and tell me its a panic attack. Ok, fine. Thinking it was just a huge one I try to rest. The symptoms of that attack lasted 3 days after that. It's not so much the panic attack, but the leftover symptoms and fear of it happening again.

“Time to try for a boy""
My dad wanted me to have a boy so bad. Both of my kids are girls. With both he kept saying maybe the ultrasound was wrong. It wasnt. I'm pregnant again and hes hoping it's a boy, but I'm convinced it's a girl. Healthy babies is all that matters to me.

Do you lose your appetite while in labor?
I did birth the births of both of my babies. There is so much going on and pains from contractions that you simply just arent hungry.
I was in labor for 32 hrs with my first. Went about 48 hours without food. I wasnt hungry at the time, but I was starving after!
With my second I was in labor from about midnight and she was born at 530pm. It wasnt bad, but after her difficult delivery I was starving.

Why do some people put a kiss (x) at the end of everything they post or send? Does it make you uncomfortable?
Maybe they’re the kind of person who’s just so expressive and loving? They probably think it’s harmless and is a positive feeling to spread around.
If you feel uncomfortable about it, just be honest about it then. Everyone see and feel things differently. Work something out and you might be able to get a mutual agreement or balance point on this issue.
I personally don’t feel uncomfortable as I know some people use different emojis to express their meanings. However, do know how to differentiate when someone is being… sexual tho. :o You might want to avoid those haha.

I don’t really understand why a guy is starving hungry and eat a lot during the date is a problem haha. As long as the way he eat food is clean and polite, I don’t think it’s a problem. Unless he gives more focus to the food rather than talking to me haha.

Is having sympathy a sign of being weak and unmanly for a male?
No! People needs to stop genderizing emotions.
Male or Female, both are humans. Both can feel happiness, sadness, and pain. It doesn’t make you unmanly for feeling emotions; it makes you a HUMAN.
Stop reacting to people who tells you what a gender should act as. Instead, be what you want to be. Prioritize your own happiness and well being. We wouldn’t want to live our limited life just to get controlled and judge by others, would we?
Life is short, love yourself. No one can treat you better than yourself!

How much should a guy eat if he's going out with a girl for the first time to avoid looking like a pig?
Why fake your food intake in the beginning if she’ll know it after being with you for sometime later?
I don’t think the amount of food intake should be a problem. Just be yourself.
Oh, and make sure you eat politely and clean. Table manners should still be taken care of. Good-luck!

What are some wrong ways to approach a potential love interest?
Being too desperate (you’ll scare them off before you even got the chance to know what is their favourite colour)
Being too conservative (you’re not giving a chance for the both of you to have something to connect to)
Just be yourself. If it’s the right one, it’ll find its way to you.

Why do people get so upset at goodbyes?
Because they cared about the people who are leaving. And they care a lot.
Also, you’ll never know if that goodbye is the last one. Life is unpredictable, and humans are so fragile.
Just appreciate whoever in your life that cares for you.

If you were/are aware you’re hurting a person’s feelings, does an apology even cross your mind?
Everyone have a different level of EQ and mindset. You are going to get a lot of different answer for this question.
For me, I am most definitely going to apologise immediately. I’m one who couldn’t stand the fact that someone is hurting because of me. The guilt bag would be around me for a long time.
However, my partner is totally the opposite of me. If he thinks that the thing he said or action he did is right, he will not feel sorry; not even feeling apologetic.
Whether you hurt someone or you are the one who got hurt, you should be frank to your partner that you feel hurt or you should accept the fact that you hurt your partner. And from there, communicate and fix things. We all make mistakes here and there and fix them to get to somewhere. All the best.

What are the best student organizations or clubs to join at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman? Why should students join them?
The best club is the one you have passion for. There are a lot of Clubs and Society (C&S) in UTAR, but not all are that active. It’s obvious that the C&S that are active are filled with passion driven students. Their activities and events are heated and known to a lot of students. Regardless of which C&S students choose to join, in general, it’s a great platform to know more people outside of their own circle, extending their social network, meeting and exchanging different knowledges and experience with people. I personally would suggest students to try joining the Orientation Programme (in SL Campus) whether as a new student, or an existing student to act as a facilitator for the new student. It’s a great place to start. Consider it as level 1 in trying to achieve what I stated above. It’…

How do I convince a girl to do my makeup and who should I try to convince?
Just tell her that. She wouldn’t know if you don’t express what you want.
And if you already did but she refused, either you give her a good reason to, or you could just go and get some makeup yourself and put it on yourself. There’s a lot of YouTube tutorials about makeup for newbies.

What should you do if your father admitted you in an engineering college but you want to be a musician?
I’d first talk to my father about what I really want and plan in life (you do want to look like you’re actually thinking ahead for the future). If he reacted badly, I’d probably just go and complete my diploma/degree in Engineering. It doesn’t hurts to get a certificate I guess? But studying something you have no interest in is most likely going to be tough and such a suffering. However, what you studied for doesn’t determines what you’ll work as after getting that certificate. You could still be a musician. There are a lot of people who are a musician but came from a different background. It’s just a matter of how and will you go and reach out to your dream. It all comes to your priority at this point. Whether if you don’t want your father to disappointed; or you don’t want to give up your…

What strikes first time visitors as special or unusual when they arrive in Malang, Indonesia?
I’ve been living in this place for 3–4 year for education purpose.
As a student, I view this place has nice environment especially the weathers. It’s chilly almost all the time.
There are many variations of food too, hence it makes you won’t be bored to enjoy culinarily, and it’s CHEAP. so if you planned to continue your study here, it can be as one of the considerations you have.
People in here seem to be more open-minded since there are many visitors in here.
For recreation, there's a tons of choice, like Jatimpark, museum angkut, waterfall, etc.

I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!

What has been the most gruesome real footage you've ever seen?
Hi. Let me tell you the story of Tatiane Spitzner and how her recorded death shocked the world and opened many eyes to what exactly domestic violence looks like. Tatiane was a 29-year-old lawyer who lived with her husband Luis Filipe in Guarapuava. Looking at pictures of the couple they looked like a happy and deeply in love couple: But behind these pictures hid a truly shocking reality that ended in a horrific way. On the 22nd of July, 2018, the couple went to a party and when they returned (at around 2:30 AM) they can be seen on CCTV parked in front of their building. They spoke for a little bit and then he suddenly hit her thrice, with considerable strength, in the head. She then tried to run and opened the door, but he forced her to close it and put her seatbelt around her neck, while grabbing her by the hair and punching her head repeatedly. Then they drove to the garage, he parked the car, got out, dragged her out and pushed her against the car. He then punched her throat causing her to pass out and fall to the ground. As she laid there he parked his car and two minutes later he came back and started kicking her until she woke up and got up. When she started regaining consciousness she decided to run for her life and she started running towards the elevator as he chased her. They both managed to get inside the elevator and she clicked the ground floor button instead of the fourth floor where they lived. When the elevator opened on the ground floor she tried to run, and managed to get out but he grabbed her and forced her back inside grabbing her and putting her against the wall until the door closed again. When they got to the fourth floor she put her hands on the sides of the elevator to try and stop him from forcing her to get out, but to no avail. When they left the elevator, it was the last time Tatiane was seen alive. When they got to their apartment, the neighbours heard her cries for help but did nothing. Less than 15 minutes later the camera outside the building filmed her body falling onto the floor. He claimed that she jumped by herself, but it's clear that's a lie because in the video we can see that she was not trying to block her face or even screaming. She was lifeless when she fell. He came downstairs, picked her up and took her to the elevator where he, covered in her blood, started to caress her face and covered her breasts. He took her back to their apartment and then came back and cleaned the blood from the elevator, before driving away. Dunia Rampazzo, a prosecutor on the case, stated: Our investigation proves that the victim was killed inside the apartment by asphyxiation and her body was thrown over the balcony of the apartment. We believe the accused then took the elevator to the ground floor and collected Tatiane’s body, taking it back up to the apartment in the elevator. We suspect that before she was killed, Luis subjected his wife to a prolonged period of violent physical aggression. This was not a suicide, but femicide. The aggressor then attempted to escape by car. The case had multiple delays due to covid, but in May this year, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. If you know someone who has an abusive partner or if you're in such a relationship, get help. Her death cannot be in vain, and it'll hopefully inspire those who need the inspiration to get out while they can. Thank you for reading.

My Zoe adopted me 2years ago when I moved into my apartment her previous owner wanted to put her down because she couldn't take her with her when she moved out, so I moved in with Zoe.
Zoe and I get on well she enjoys her space. Problem is Zoe doesn't allow me to sleep late. I wake up every morning at 5h30 and feed her get ready for work and leave at 7h00, if I get back into bed on a morning that I don't have to go to work she brings home birds she catches or she jumps on top of me meowing licking or biting me until I eventually give up and get out of bed. If I decide to take a nap infront of the TV she does the same.
How do I get Zoe to let me sleep late?

Yes. This. 1000%. I have my standards obviously in course I wouldn’t do it unless I was in excruciating pain so I could care less if the floor was clean or not when this happens to me. Last resort.

What’s the worse they can do? I’m speaking as a patient who has severe bone pain that has been waiting five hours in a hard chair. Sometimes it’s not to be difficult but it’s the only option.

Thanks for the clarification. I was also wondering why they yelled at me to get off the floor when I was extremely ill. I had an awful fracture on my lower back and after 5 hours I could NOT sit in the hard chairs. So chairs any longer. I was out of my mind in pain but they didn’t care and I kept it to myself because there was nothing they were going to do. I just thought a different position would help even though yes, it was probably terribly unsanitary. I didn’t care. I just got on the floor. What can they do besides yell They yelled at you?me of course but I countered if you have a better solution I’m all ears. They didn’t.

Sadly I witnessed both. I was in a horrible hospital while in college dealing with breaking my arm and there was this psychotic woman having an huge break. Instead of treating her they just injected her with a bunch off different drugs until she stopped yelling. I interned in a psych ward before and I knew this was the completely wrong protocol! No restraints or watching her on camera. A few hours later the same staff tried waking her up for breakfast and she wouldn’t move. They kept yelling to get up but I knew the first time. It was really sad especially that none of these people were held accountable.

I don’t think anyone gets to judge Marilyn Monroe unless you lived her life and walked in her shoes. Her mother was mentally unstable causing her aunt to care for her. When she finally made a life for herself from modeling to acting, most men, directors mostly, took advantage of her and didn’t pay her anything near what she deserved compared to her men counterparts. Most deserved in diamonds is a girls best friend. Marilyn never even got paid for being playboy of the year. She paid for her mother to receive the best care. It’s not talked about often, but she inherited her mother’s mental illness as well and was suicidal about it. She took a lot of pills and alcohol which is how she passed. Albeit whatever allegations about the dirty dishes and IBS, where were the maids to take care of the dishes and sheets?

I hate being bodyshamed for being skinny. I have a GI condition that is excruciating and causes issues but aside from that, that’s how I naturally am. A bunch of random people started bullying me on my Poshmark account and even though I’m in my late 20s it’s still so cruel and degrading.

Have you ever been rude to someone and thought that you were right in doing so?
Not sure if it is considered rude. I Just responded in kind. This was several decades ago. As a child, and into my mid twenties I was naturally very skinny. Not underweight but skinny. Well, one day, I was coming home from work. I was about 22 years old or so.. This overweight woman, with moles on her face, about 50 or so, says to me-""You are so skinny, you need to eat something. You would look so much better with some meat on your bones.” Mind you, I worked at a restaurant at that time. I ate 2 meals there everyday. I had bacon and eggs, and for lunch I had fish, and pasta. And-I was going to have dinner later, at home So, her comment was ridiculous. I was just a skinny healthy 22 year old, who was naturally skinny. How I miss those days! Well, I lost it with her. I said- ""You should really lose some weight. You should eat less. You would look so much better with some meat off your bones. You should have those moles on your face checked, and removed, you would look better. Are we done exchanging advice complete stranger?” She just sat on the bench and gawked at me. The bus arrived, and she got on first and sat in the front. As, I got on, the bus, the handsome bus driver looks at me and says, you're a pretty girl. A boy about my age smiles at me. The big lady, heard the bus driver, and saw the youngman smile at me. I was just a skinny, 22 year-old in blue jeans and a Tee-Shirt, and no makeup. As I walked by the advice lady when I got off the bus. I smiled at her, and said you have a great day now. She rolled her eyes, and didn't respond. I was a bit harsh, with her, but, her commenting negatively on my personal appearance, was just inappropriate. Her making an inaccurate asumption, that I didn't eat, and telling me what I need to do, was, hurtful,, and disrespectful. I know she thought twice about what she said to people after that.

What are you talking about? Anorexia definitely is otherwise they wouldn’t consult psych in the first place. According to the dsm it is definitely a psychiatric condition. I’m not talking about appetite loss. I’m talking about being a small person already who has severe weight loss. That raises eyebrows unfortunately that strays away from my main medical issues. My doctor typical will not prescribe pain medication because it creates nausea.

It’s a joke for me. I’ve suffered for years with documented GI problems however whenever I show up to the er it’s a hit or miss situation. Sometimes they give me what I need other times they won’t. With my condition it also causes a lot of weight loss so they love to throw in a psych diagnosis of anorexia.

It might be cheaper however depending on numerous factors such as taking into account how long the flight is- I’d say 8 hours or more, which airline it is, certain amenities, most importantly if you have medical conditions where you just cannot sit straight for hours on end. Some things you can’t put a price on. I’m not an extremist and say blow $20k for emirates but a practical price especially if you have the capability to use mileage to upgrade.

It’s hard to pick one.. I recently had a tech picking on me. I don’t know why she didn’t like me but she was a straight up bully. I have serious GI issues such as gastroparesis which constantly flares and causes extreme vomiting. When I was admitted to the er I went to the bathroom and all of a sudden she starts banging on the door telling me to get out. I was literally hovering over the toilet saying lady don’t F&ck with me. I’ve never been more furious in my life. I ended up reporting her to hr. I’ll find out later what happened.

I’m trying to figure out if my mom has dementia or a “selective memory”. She does not use I statements, take any accountability for mistakes made on her part, however Will apologize with complete sarcasm and turn the tables. I don’t even consider them mistakes at this point. It’s was pure negligence in my case letting me go so long without physical care because school was more important. Yes I graduated high school at the top of my class getting all A’s. Yes I went to an Ivy League. But at what cost? I am 31 have severe kidney failure, osteoporosis, gastroparesis, etc, because as a kid she refused to listen to me if something was wrong. “Yes I was making up all my ailments as early as 3 years old” if anything I can stay it made me stronger to deal with such a person like that from the start.

I mean, I hid my meth addiction from my boyfriend who I lived with for 2 whole years before I finally broke down and told him.
He said he had no idea, but that he wasn’t exactly that surprised when he thinks back about how I was always so energetic, able to work 3 jobs without a complaint, and how little sleep I needed to function normally compared to most people… lol.
So, unless you’ve been smoking it around him or being blatantly and obviously tweaked out, maybe he just thinks you have a quirky personality 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have been trying to figure out why I am the way I am my entire life. Constantly trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Or if there even is anything actually wrong with me. Maybe I’m just more weak, less adequate, less worthy of a person than most.
I relate pretty heavily to every single one of these. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember so I was confused at first, because I just considered them my norm… even though my norm also consists of knowing that these traits make me feel the very opposite of “normal”.
Anyway. It was oddly comforting to read this list, written by someone else, when it feels like it could have come from my brain. Thank you for taking the time to write it.

What do you remember about your first relationship?
I wouldn’t call my first boyfriend a relationship. The middle school stuff is just puppy love. My first real relationship was in high school. We lived in the same neighborhood but went to different schools. He played football and was super smart. My parents loved him. Not as much as me of course . We went on dates, walked around the neighborhood, snuck in some hanky panky when our parents weren’t home. We even made love in a hotel room when my parents took us to a fancy NYE party/dance. He left for college a year before me. He stopped calling and writing letters as often and I panicked and broke up with him. That aaa 30 years ago and he has kept up with me all these years. He’s married and has a beautiful family wile I’m still struggling with fear of abandonment that has affected my curren…

Only after a year and three months of the year was no contact. We both changed. I worked on myself the past year. He worked on himself. We are both more ready to acknowledge on our own issues and we communicate much better. It’s falling in love all over again. He is even more romantic

Should I expect an ex-narcissist to come back after he’s had me blocked already for 3 weeks? He’s never done this before.
Why would you want a narcissist back? Focus on yourself and work on becoming the best version of yourself. You have to look within to find out why you want to return to a narcissist. He’s probably with his new “supply” (someone who uplifts his ego) and will pop back up in your life when you’re not giving a care about him l, him, after she’s left.

What are the signs of flirtation that girls miss?
Sometimes girls just don't see the signs especially when they are not used to being flirted with. If a girl is approached by a guy I feel like she should try to relax and maybe see what he's thinking about. If she's given a hint of a date or something else it might help!

Do you feel bad about telling lies regarding your ex?
Depends. I guess I consider an ex exactly that no longer my problem. Spreading rumors about someone you used to care about is immature. I wouldn't recommend it. The best revenge is living your life happily. Doing things that make your life incredible. Being a bit more spontaneous or whatever you enjoy. Don't feed into the feeling you may have of wanting him/her to suffer like you are move on is the best answer.

I always wanted to describe what happened, but never found the words. Thank you for giving the words to my story. No one ever said anything, he was there for a few month, months, and only an eye contact was enough. We both knew it was special. This happened while I was also realizing how emotionally abusive my husband of 8 years has been. I needed that person to help me think of me like I never did.

Wow, out stories are so similar! I am constantly conflicted and confused too. My man cares for me like no other and makes home a safe haven for me. And then, when I am comfortable in our little world, he criticizes me and acts indifferent all the time. I lived in guilt for not doing enough for 7 years. He uses power and control whereever he can. He offeres and offers and pulls away just in the end. We are married for 8 years now and I am recognizing his abuse now when he stopped me from going to work and asked me to prioritize family. I now know why he never wants to communicate with me. He is internally (maybe subconciously) witholding. From what I ahve read and understood, some people feed from negativity. They create negativity so they can live in the only environment they have known. My husband has lived in such negative environment growing up. I am on a dependent visa, so I cannot go anywhere yet. And he knows if he gets green card, I will leave him. He has said it himself. So he is not even trying to get greencard. So my only plan is to do my master’s and get my own visa.
but while I am working towards my goal, I am conflicted everyday. I am confused everyday. I still blame me. On good days like today, I feel shameful for my thoughts and plans. But I am hoping will know better in coming years.
please connect with me in private if u ever want to talk. I am seeing a therapist to overcome self esteem issues, among many other things. Consider that for u too.

I feel it is important for my son to have a sibling. We live in a very lonely world and I wanted him to have that one person who could have been his best friend ( like my sisters are for me). I understand there is a possibility of siblings not getting along.. but I didn’t want to deny a close bond to him based on that possibility

It was discussed before marriage! He said he wanted 3 kids. But he got into financial planning and early retirement. And now he plans to retire at 55 with x amount of money in his account. Another kid means he will to work another 10 years. So he is denying me happiness now for an unforseen future.

Well I have no intention of having a kid if my husband does not want it. And still mine tracks my period, uses condom and made me take plan B twice to make sure it does not happen. I could have lied and not taken the pill.. but well.. I am a reasonable person stuck with a selfish man 🤷‍♀️

Being genuine is about being genuine. What you are proposing is that they pretend to be genuine, which is counter-intuitive to actually being genuine. You rely on the presumption that the person is an attention seeker, or something else similarly negative.

Yes absolutely get help! I cannot stress this enough, unless you are on of the lucky few who are so mentally resilient they can deal with these things. I am not one of those and from the sounds of it you aren’t either. The thing is you’ll never know if you need the help if you don’t actually go and get help. Stuff like this, especially from a young age, can damage you without you even realising. So yes, go get help!
I am so so sorry this happened to you. You’ve made the first step by asking a question on here. Just remember that you are the victim, do not feel shame or guilt about it, as it was something out of your control. Believe in yourself and be strong.
Wishing all the best.

I completely understand where you’re coming from - but all of the negatives you have described can be applied to any form of entertainment, literature, TV, music they can all cause the negatives that you describe.
So yes you are right people can use them for escapist reasons (even though I actually believe a level of escapism is normal and necessary) and other negative reasons but I wouldn’t blame video games or any media, it’s more of a human thing.

Actually you couldn’t be more wrong. I can understand that a lot of people hate hip hop because it’s different - and has a bad reputation, however to say that Kanye has no musical ability, even if you don’t like his music is absurd.
I can appreciate that the topics that Kanye deals with can on the surface appear meaningless and money orientated but that is just the nature of his life. He is a strange, unstable individual who has made various odd life decisions, but to dismiss his music on those grounds just doesn’t seem like anything other than you don’t like his music.
Also Kanye was originally known for actually being a producer, so you know, he actually made his own music. Obviously as time has gone on he has involved many other people to help him make his more recent work - so I can understand questioning his musical ability based on how his recent music has been created, but originally he did fully produce his own music - and I just can’t see how you can claim he has no musical ability when lyrics and voice aside, he actually produced the rest of the music which to me actually demonstrates that he has at least some level of musical ability.

Although I understand how evil narcissists can be - I wouldn’t really suggest doing any of the above. Move on, be the better person, be blunt and honest. You made a mistake in being with them (even though it really isn’t your fault, I detest victim blaming but you do need to accept that you were part of the relationship).
Narcissists aren’t healthy, mentally stable people - and should be treated as such!
EDIT: I am young and unfamiliar with being in such a relationship so please accept my comment as a purely personal perspective.

How do you prove to your ex that you are not a narcissist, without looking like your hovering? I was a drunk and drug user, sober since our breakup. It's been well over a year without her and I've never experienced this type of pain and emptiness.
Simple answer unfortunately, you don’t. it doesn’t matter that you are sober now - because that isn’t the you that she knows. The best thing you can try and do is move on and accept your mistakes. I’d suggest looking at getting some therapy or at least visiting a doctor and describing your feelings of emptiness. I can only speak from experience and offer you my perspective, maybe she would like to reconnect, maybe she doesn’t, I really can’t tell you what to do. Personally I would go no further than sending her a message and apologising. Do not expect anything - the more you think about her the worse it will get and unfortunately this was just part of your development as a person. I apologise if I sound negative in any way - but honestly I believe that the past is the past and you can’t change…

What can I do in the next half-hour to make myself less depressed?
Grab a drink, preferably non-caffeinated with no sugar. Put some nostalgic music on. Sit outside. Dress comfortably. Focus on your breathing. Think of everything you do have - not what you don’t have. Think of your family, your pet or your friends (if you are blessed enough to have any of those things). If you feel like crying, let it out. Let your emotions out, just release everything and be in the moment. Of course none of these things will fix your depression and I truly understand from personal experience that when you are depressed it is incredibly hard to make yourself less depressed and just by thinking about it can make it worse. I find reflecting upon my life, my experiences, the good and the bad can help. Understand that you are who you are, there is no easy fix, and if you didn’t…

Whenever I think about a particular thing my heart tighten and I feel a pain in my heart . Even if my mind is diverted, I just cannot shake that feeling off . Plzz can someone tell me what is my problem?
It depends on what that specific thing is. If it is something negative, which I strongly presume it is, then it could definitely be to do with anxiety or event to an extent some level of PTSD. Speaking for myself, I know that I have very similar feelings when my mind thinks back to negative memories that I’ve had in the past, and just by thinking of them it triggers the exact feeling that I got when the event actually happens. Past traumatic memories in particular, but I’ve found that whenever that happens I force myself to understand that the past is the past and that i need to be in the present - coupled with some breathing excercises. If whatever it is not very nice to think about, I can only suggest that you try and think about it objectively, without blame and guilt just accept it and…

What is the solution to the Palestinian and Israeli conflict?
The Israeli people must adopt the orphans of Palestine, and the Palestinians must adopt the orphans of Israel, and each must raise these children in the religions of the deceased parents. This will bring these peoples together in a just and lasting peace.

From my Personal Opinion North Korea’s aware of the danger of their acts towards South Korea and USA, but it’s only a matter of time to get more benefits from the coming agreement.

I agree with Sinan, a direct war is very unlikely between them, I think the deal between that was made with Obama and Iran will push further for more diplomacy.
Many people thinks that Iran is really a nuclear threat, Iran strugling to fix their plane and cars, it’s only a propaganda by the iranian govt in order to catch attentrion

Do romances like in the movies actually happen in real life?
Actually all the romance in movies based on a true events or human imagination, so I think it could be close enough to real life.

My Father never talks to a women with disrespect and i have the same habit. He never spoke a ill word about her with me in his entire life. Whenever i visit my father he asks how is everything at home.My Father even made attempts to forget everything even before my kid was born and tried to invite her for family functions and also gave us to freedom to stay wherever we want, but this time my wife did not wan’t to join family no matter how hard i tried to convince her.
“ who is wrong now”? His father or his wife decide yourself.

How many dads out there don't know how to change their baby's diaper?
You need to get your head in the game, my friend. As your children get older their problems get bigger and more complex. I often wish that I could soothe my troubled 6 year old as easily as I did when she was a baby. Changing diapers is something concrete that you can do to help both your baby and wife. Don’t miss the chance to fix all the problems that have an instant solution!

What are some good crafts to make with toddlers?
Toddlers are easily entertained just not for very long! It's best to have things set up and ready to go but I'm never that organized. Washable paint - Paint with fingers, paint with brushes, cut up some clean sponges (into shapes if you're feeling industrious) and dip the sponges into the paint. Stamps - Stamps and an ink pad are always a hit. Glue- Print their name in glue on a piece of construction paper. Then they can stick marshmallows/cotton/etc to the glue and 'make' their name. Threading: Toddlers can thread cheerios or colorful straws (that you've cut into pieces) onto pipe cleaners. Twist it into a bracelet. Use painter's tape to make a design on craft paper. Let your little one paint all over the paper. While the paint is still wet carefully remove the tape to show the design - grea…

My biggest regret in life so far is having children. How do I learn to enjoy parenting more?
Kids can be boring. Get them involved in things that you like to do. They are incredibly malleable. Just use your powers for good not evil.

No one tells you that sometimes these wonderful bundles of magic suck. Their dispositions can be bad and taking care of them is a lot of work - emotional work, financial work, manual work. Dude, it's a lot. Many long days will be spent trying to wipe up their bodily fluids before those same bodily fluids end up being wiped up on you. That right there can be a whole day. It isn't one long joy fest of parenting. It's a lot (if you're lucky) of little moments that make it profound.

I like your way of studying- this is similar to how I studied in college, too. You mentioned that medication doesn’t always work for you- I’d experienced this too, and after talking with my doctor, found out that most ADHD medication affects women more/less depending on where they’re at in their menstrual cycle. Not sure if this helps/is useful, but thought I’d share!

Is it normal for someone with ADHD to think about multiple topics within a short period of time?
TL;DR: Yes, sometimes. You know that feeling when you’ve read the same paragraph five times, but you still don’t know what it says? That’s what ADHD feels like. It doesn’t necessarily mean that I have racing thoughts in my head all the time, it just means I can’t focus on what I’m wanting to focus on. Sometimes when I’m feeling high energy or excited, I can get racing thoughts like what you’ve described. Sometimes, I feel more like I have a brain fog, and it’s difficult to grasp onto the train of thought that I want without it slipping away. The severity of ADHD is different from person-to-person, and even an individuals lived experience can vary. For example, we know that menstruating women have worse/better symptoms during different times in their cycle. Or, I know I tend to exhibit more “h…

Can Adderall give someone with ADHD a stimulant feeling if they are new to it?
When I was very first figuring out what dosage worked best for me, there were a couple of times that I’d accidentally taken more than needed. Being on too much addy can feel a bit exciting, like a strong caffeine buzz, but it’s not super comfortable, either. I felt like a machine that had been given too strong of a voltage- lots of energy, exciting, but exhausting. On edge, like a taut string.
On both occasions, once the addy wore off my body felt a bit sore, like I’d been dehydrated. I had a difficult time falling asleep, and my appetite was gone. It’s not super fun.

My son has been begging for a new phone. I have tried all the options, but all of them are too expensive. What should I do?
Buy what you can afford. Be open with your child about what you can and cannot afford. If they’re old enough, set up a payment plan with them.
Ie: “I can afford to front X amount; let’s see if we can find a phone in that budget. If you don’t like any of these and want something more expensive, I’m happy to pay that amount towards what you’d like. If you can come up with the rest, we can purchase this phone you’ve been wanting.”

If your adult son/daughter, who is very much capable of working and help witht he house finances, doesn't want to work out of pure laziness and expects to get everything form others, would you let them stay at your house or would you kick them out?
TL;DR: Kick them out. Communicate and set clear boundaries. Help a family member out if you can, but know the difference between helping and enabling. ___________________________________________________________ I had this situation recently with a younger brother. I was torn. He didn’t have a job when he came to live with me, and no savings either. No problem, I’d said, first month’s on me. He was a 20 year old young adult (I was 24) with incredibly adverse life experiences that have left him with little to no experience with the “real world”, but had worked simple jobs like fast food and janitorial positions. No sense for the worth of money. No problem, I’ll help you put together a resume and apply to jobs. Let’s talk about how to budget, how to grocery shop when you’re poor, how to cook simp…

Does Adderall make you more motivated and confident (ADHD)?
Adderall doesn’t make me more motivated or confident. It makes my brain quiet, and more functional for modern purposes. I’m definitely motivated to get my job done- I like my boss and co-workers, and completing my job makes work easier for them. I like the sense of accomplishment I get upon completing projects. I particularly enjoy having money to spend on things like food and housing. But sometimes my brain has other plans. My lack of attention isn’t a lack of motivation. It’s a lack of “flow”, or consistency. Starting a task isn’t a problem, but staying on task continues to evade me. Before my diagnosis, I relied on extensive checklists and reminders, and the occasional nudge from a co-worker. Adderall alleviates the need for those extra systems. Adderall doesn’t add motivation- it just mak…

How do I deal with an ADHD child?
It’s encouraging to see this question asked. As a heads up, I do not have a professional background in treating ADHD, so what I have to say is all anecdotal. Both my twin brother and I were diagnosed with ADHD. He was diagnosed around 14, I was 24. Here’s what would have helped: Pro-active Monitoring: In my brother’s case, he was never taken in for diagnosis until he was really struggling in school. He got help after everything had gone wrong. I wasn’t diagnosed, because I managed to squeak by. It took until I was to my breaking point before I got diagnosed, and got help; it’s made a world of difference, and I always wish that I’d had help sooner. If you are a parent and you think there’s a chance your child may have ADHD (it’s highly heritable), keep an eye out for the signs, and get help be…

Exactly! It’s like getting a controller to “life”, but with better setting than you had previously. It takes a little bit to adjust to the new sensitivities, but overall makes for a much smoother experience.

What did it feel like the first time taking ADHD medication?
Note: The first medication I tried was 10mg of Adderall at the age of 24; I am a 130 lbs female. The first time was definitely the most “intense” reaction I’ve had. You know all of the white noise that’s surrounding you right now? For me, it’s the hum of my laptop, the wind in the trees outside, the air conditioning blowing through my home. But if I really listen, I can hear cars in the background, the occasional airplane, even myself breathing- all white noise that I normally filter out. Adderall was like taking all of that noise, and with the snap of a finger, silence. I’d become so accustomed to all of the different thought channels that were running through my head, and all of a sudden, it was quiet. It was just ‘me’ in there. Like tuning the channel on a radio, I could direct my thought…

Thank you for the advice!
Luckily(ish?), I don’t really have credit nor have I ever depended on it, so I don’t expect too many additional issues there. The name I’ve chosen is Americanized/Anglicized in it’s spelling.
My main desire in changing my name is to get rid of any trace of my existence elsewhere, in order to dissuade dangerous/stalker like family members. Unfortunately, I don’t have enough evidence to take to court, and am worried that if I were to do so making my current location public would only put me in more danger, so for now I’m keeping things quiet. I already keep most of my online interactions under alias, but wanted to go one step further just to sleep easier at night.

I learned about this early 2021 around my 30th birthday. I have been under the thumb of the same Narcissistic foster parent (mother) for 25 years, and NEVER have I been allowed to speak the truth or my mind or have a back bone. I remember being backed into a corner by her and her friends being severely abused and hit and beat on as a child. And unfortunately, I've carried that trait into my adulthood, until I woke up at 3 in the morning in pain and went to the ER and found out I almost had a heart attack or stroke either that day or week, and then found out later on that week I developed BOTH Hashimoto's Disease AND Graves Disease (thyroid diseases) and that it's REALLY RARE to have both diseases, and then realized after doing research that it all has to do with using my voice, and that my foster parent was trying to take away my voice and literally kill me. I'm still sick, still have to take medication right now, but little by little I've been using my voice and finding the strength I used to have again. In fact, when the Narcissist foster parent came to see me for my 31st birthday and started stuff, I was able to call her out (which infuriated her) but left me feeling more powerful speaking truth to her lies. But yes, dealing with a Narcissist CAN and WILL put you in the hospital if you don't do something about it.

Honestly, I left her sorry behind in Orlando and dropped her. Went No contact PERMANENTLY.
For YEARS I had put up with her neeed to be the center of my universe, dealt with her insulting comments, didn't wear the same colors as her or same perfumes or eat the same foods as her (etc), dealt with her making comments about me behind my back and our ""friends"" that we shared disrespecting me because of her, her therapist snapping at me for her behavior because she made up stories and blamed me for things, said she ""might"" have done stuff but it was only because of _______ (name your excuse), the list go ones and on…
Until one day, I had enough.
I remember we had a friend who worked at Disney World and we were in Orlando, and she had helped me move to Tampa, and in conversation with her and that acquaintance, I told them MY SPIRITUAL BELIEFS had changed and that I no longer held the same beliefs as then, and they froze, and THAT is when EVERYTHING changed. I saw her become possibly the worst version of her that I had seen. She became angry, asked why I couldn't have told her earlier, then started to argue with me saying trying to tell me about how ""amazing"" and ""great"" our denomination was (at the time) and that the LEAST I could have done was _______(x,y and z). And then she and that acquaintance got up, went into the acquaintance's room and slammed the door, leaving me out in the living room. I sat on the couch and thought all night. Before I realized it, it was morning and the sun was rising. I remember going over how she treated me through the years, whether it was a things done or said and I remembered them both getting up and coming out from their room and her angrily stomping around, wouldn't look at me and put shoes on and went downstairs and the acquaintance making faces at me and closing the door and then 15 minutes later she came back, slammed a venti Starbucks cup full of tea on the table and went back into the acquaintance's room with the acquaintance. Well, I wasn't putting up with it anymore and got my shoes on, took my stuff, put it in the car, took that tea and left QUICKLY and drove my stunned and shocked behind back to Tampa. I was surprised at myself, because I never IMAGINED IN MY LIFE doing what I did or being strong enough to walk away from her, but there I was, in the morning traffic, LEAVING her for GOOD and I wasn't coming back. In the days and weeks and months that followed, she tried to contact me via email and phone calls (to which I bluntly and coldly told her I wouldn't speak to her again, I wasn't explaining anything, and moving forward we will only speak by email), her friends tried multiple times to call me (to which I ended up telling them it's in their beat interest that they mind their own business and stay out of hers and mine), and lived my life. The ex friend tried to contact me multiple times, but I held my ground. It's not say I Don't plan on giving her back why is hers, but it is to say I found my strength and I realize my worth, and I realized I don't need someone who claims to be your friend but it's not a friend. Who makes everything all about her and who needs to be a center of everyone's universe, and whose opinion needs to be the only thing that matters, Who pretends to be a leader and has followers who follow her blindly and treat people any sort of toxic way blindly. Since then, I've learned that toxic people attract toxic people and they come in groups. And I've learned who to let in my life and who did not learn in my life. And I've let go of many friends, and family members, and I have found the strength and self-esteem to be able to make better friends and make better decisions in my life. So I went cold turkey that's what I did with her. I cut her off permanently. For good. I don't know if my story could have helped you, and I don't recommend that everybody do what I did by cutting people off, that's just what I do if that works for me and that's within my personality to do so, and to treat someone coldly and bluntly and to remove them from my life. But I do recommend that you do what's best for you, to remove anyone in your life who is toxic and negative, including friends. And I definitely encourage you to find a method that helps you because you don't deserve having friends in your life who are not loving or supportive or who don't care about you. I hope this helps ❤️.

Why am I wrong to fear that people think that I’m incapable?
You're not wrong for fearing that thought, it's normal to feel that way. But if you're letting it stop you from doing what you can, from living life, then yes, you are very wrong for that. What others think of you and does not matter if they are not there supporting you or encouraging you. Essentially, what others think doesn't matter. Do you think you're capable? If you do, go for whatever it is you want to accomplish . If you don't, only you can sit down and really and truly think over that and figure out what is holding you back and why the opinions of others is tied so strongly into it and affects you so strongly. I will also add this: Not believing in you and your capabilities holds you back from so much in life and all that you can accomplish for you. Never allow the thoughts and nega…

Can you say you loved someone because you accepted them for who they are?
Honestly, I think I loved my boyfriend semi-shallowly, but when he saw all my flaws and faults, and accepted me, and I learned all about him and found myself still accepting of him, that's when I truly fell deep in love with him…Not just his looks, or the fact he's from another country but the fact that I love what I see deep within him. We both have our bad days, where we could go anywhere from annoyed or frustrated to asking to just have some alone time to release and refresh and then come back to each other the next day. I'm learning to grow and so is he, but in spite of it all, in spite of all our errors, we still love each other very much and feel we are each other's perfect match to do life together with.

Why does my boyfriend ask me about my period?
My boyfriend just did this to me. My periods are irregular, and so I have PCOS. When they come, it can be painful. For me, he wanted to understand why I get mood swings or act aggressive or during that time, how he could help me feel better instead of me being depressed. I think your boyfriend (and this is just an assumption) is just showing he cares and wants to understand what it's like so that maybe he can help you feel better when it comes and to take your mind off of it as much as he can.

Why is it so hard for people with Major Depressive Disorder to keep our rooms clean?
I will answer this from my own experience : As someone suffering from dysthymia, I have become slow in many things. Cleaning is one of them. A clean house does actually make my head clearer so I should really do it more often. Still, it's rock hard. Why? Let me explain. I am living a pretty isolated life. My husband is off to work everyday and works overtime hours many days. I am pretty much home alone every day. I do have friends but they just live a little far away for me to see them often. I don't mind being alone as I'm introverted and like my own space and silence. Cleaning often just doesn’t bother me. Like many things in life don't bother me. I am thinking alot about why I am alive. Don't get me wrong- I am not suicidal- I just wonder a lot about my purpose on this planet. I am very luc…

What is something that someone said to you during your grieving that stuck with you?
I lost my first child at 25th week, a baby girl, fetal demise. I delivered my baby the next day after we found out. Umbilical cord twisted. We cremated her and had just picked up her ash. Mom was in Vietnam at the time. I called home but she already knew the news from my aunt who lives in the States and near me. She asked and I will never forget it , but for knowing her character, I was not surprised, she said “ What did you do that the baby died?”

Your mom’s friend, I’m not surprised with what she said. The majority of Vietnamese elders have no sense of honoring their loved one’s pride. For them , if you’re the kid (the young one) you must obey whatever the elderly says, even if it’s the most absurd thing. I do not like that kind of mindset. And I also like the way your mom handled that woman her friend. Your mom stood up for you. My mom would have sided with her friend and scolded me if i talked back like that. That’s the way my mom and a lot of VIetnamese moms were and still are. Well I don’t speak to her much. But good for you. The confidence of a child most of the time comes from the way she/he be treated by the parents.

Are people with mental illness truly aware of their mental illness or do they believe everyone else is the problem?
Unless the person is psychotic (having an episode where they perceive reality differently) or narcissistic (expert at externalising blame) they would generally accept that they have a condition that is not anyone’s “fault” but rather just bad luck. Thinking that it is not their responsibility would more likely be a personality trait rather than anything associated with the illness itself. Note that awareness falls on a spectrum and can be influenced by the length of time following diagnosis. It took me years to accept I had bipolar but I never blamed anyone else for my suffering even when I didn’t think it was caused by a mental illness. Lumping everyone in the same category and assuming they will respond the same way is akin to generalising that anyone with a chronic physical illness will…

Why are bipolar people considered crazy?
I don’t think it’s fair to say that people with bipolar are universally considered crazy. Psycho-education can help people without the condition to understand more about it and be more understanding around why people act the way they do. Madness is in the eye of the beholder.

Thanks Kenneth, thanks for the response and I do agree, I think “reason” would have been a more appropriate word choice. I guess the core of this is she is taking it as an excuse when I see it as a way to explain how I am affected by my negative thoughts. It’s not right to take these out on her. I’m having a min-melt down about how to either resolve this or let it go. Thanks for your input. Even though mental illness is invisible it can still impact your thinking/behaviour, right?

FYI the situation with the length between mood shifts is more complex with “ultra rapid cycling” used to describe rapid shifts of mood for bipolar sufferers and “ultradian cycling” now used to describe shifts occurring over cycles as short as a day.

If you read between the lines you’ll see he obviously did have a drinking dependency whether daily or whatever. Alcoholic is just a label. Unless you’ve been in a relationship with someone who is abusing alcohol you may not understand the ramifications for the person involved who has to watch a loved one slowly kill themselves.

My ex boyfriend of 3 years and I have been on again off again most of that time. My main issue was his heavy daily dependency on alcohol (although he is high functioning and never violent). However the emotional games that came with his getting drunk sometimes bordered on emotional harassment. While I was the one to end it six months ago we never broke off contact and continued seeing each other and sleeping together. I started hoping to get back with him however he is now neither wanting to move forward nor communicating he has closed the chapter... saying he doesn't know what the future holds and ""I haven't given up though I'm not holding on"". The truth is I'm far from over him and pretty much still in love with him. Is he just playing mind games with me and how can I hope to move on without the external feedback I think I need (ie: him saying he doesn't want to ever get back with me)? I feel unable to make the decision to move on when I feel like there might be still a chance with him. I know this sounds convoluted and it's a simplified version but I just wish I could know what he truly felt and if he is playing tricks on my heart so I don't waste any more of my time pining over him. I have recently stopped contacting him but it's hard when I feel like we might still have a chance at a future together. Being in such an unhealthy relationship has made me doubt I'm worth anything more, hence the wanting to go back to him for what is comfortable and reassuring.

Does a thing exist, if we don't have a name for it?
Existence is not determined by language. Language does not determine existence. An example of this is the concept of untranslatable words. What has a name in one language may not have a name in another. The English language has one name for “snow” while some Inuit dialects have over twenty different names for it showing that this phenomenon is important to their culture. This does not mean that more types of snow exist where they live but reflects the variations of snow that the observing culture notices. “Mokita” is a word in the Kivila language spoken on the Papua New Guinean island of Kiriwina. Loosely translated it means “the truth we all know but agree not to talk about”. In English we don’t have a name for this but we still know or are aware it still exists. For example one might say “…

How do Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day compare?
So they are up there in my list of bands I love.
Sum 41- Is questioning the world. (The hell song) But has this self deserved anger (still waiting) or sadness (without you) to help provide meaning or searching in life.
Blink 182- Ok let’s make light of real life issues. I don’t need to grow up (Whats my age again) I just wanna do me (shut up) blame my family for who I am (reckless abandon) (anthem part 2) I can’t change nothing (dammit) I’m fuckin sad (Adams song)
Green Day- all I need is me and I love it (Boulevard of broken dreams) (still breathing) (give me novacaine) (brain stew) (basket case)

Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
Nurture. Environment is active and conscious, nature is hidden. Or so for me that’s how I feel. Imagine being born with the most desirable genes and traits, but you go through hardships your whole entire life , the traits that are most valuable to you, of course will stick, but the hardships will cause great havoc in traits that are vulnerable.

Real answer is no. Once legal, it’s ur mind that stops you. Your parents are going to tell u how they feel, u can respectively validate it as well as getting the piercing, by letting them know it is you and you are legal age, and you hope not to upset them.

Another right here 🤚🏻 trust us all when we say nobody gives a flying fuck. Also trust me when I say, those who don’t give a fuck, will at some point begin to when they repeatedly get accused of something and have it shoved down their throats. So please don’t act surprised when white people do become actually begin to show hate and make attempts to “discredit” whatever bullshit you’re spewing, because you’re literally asking for it sparking these debates. All. The. Time.

Do I still deserve to be happy after all the mistakes I had in the past?
How awful could it be? Hurting someone in purpose is such a bad idea. For whatever reason it is, what's past is past. If only a time machine exists so that you can travel backward and ensure everything was right in the first place. Everyone seems to travel in time to re-do everything all over again. That's the idea of a perfect world. Get rid of the things that could probably drag you from overthinking. Try to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. No doubt, it haunts you like forever? Be thankful for what you have. The power of being thankful even when things don't go your way. Look after something or someone that can make you happy. After all, you just have to move on and be ensure to keep your head up.

Why does make up make me happy?
Drop dead gorgeous wannabe. Who doesn't? Anyhow not too much intentionally. The no make-up makeup look is quite highly desirable. It really takes a good practice to actually master the techniques. I adore people who can do good in makeup and how they can pull it off effortlessly. I dream of someday being a professional makeup artist :)

How can I keep myself together and stay up after not sleeping?
It's somehow very frustrating because all you want to do is going to bed. Your mind, body is tired but you can't sleep. Do you think you are in a state of depression? Perhaps. Probably because it leads to imbalances in chemicals in the brain. At first by trying to avoid using your mobile phone before going to bed yet at the same time you wants to do some reading. It will start to drag you by minutes to hours. While your alarm clock is set at 5.30am. Now it almost 3 in the morning. It can be so stressful until you actually woke up by the alarm feeling restless. Kick-start your day with a cup of coffee will do. Boosting up a bit even though your mind is unable to rest and relax.

Why do people hurt you if you have a good heart and soul?
Remind yourself that kindness is always the answer. We are treated somehow a good wellbeing to not hurt others. To always put ourselves in peoples’ shoe. What if? What if it happens to us, what would it be like to overcome the circumstances? We go beyond the consequences beforehand. By showing some respect I am pretty sure we will less likely to hurt people. Not everyone have the same thinking as we do and by the way of that, we tend to not involve with this circle of population any longer.

I am in tears. I can only imagine how horrific it must have been to actually witness something like that. Your descriptive telling of events brought pictures to my mind that both hurt my heart and astounded me. The suffering that poor man went through—it just wrecks me to think about it. Thank you for showing him care and compassion during his last days. I’m not very religious, but I pray he is now completely in peace.

What is the function of alkaline phosphatase, and why is it used in hematology tests?
Hello I'm just a student studying medical technology so I am not an expert but from the review material I am studying it mentioned that it is a nonspecific enzyme that is found in many tissues but it's major tissue sources are the liver, the bone, the placenta, and the intestine. From what I understand the value of measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lies not in measuring the total ALP levels but in measuring it's isoenzymes. The isoenzymes of ALP is associated with several conditions. The liver isoenzyme is usually elevated in obstructive jaundice, the bone isoenzyme is elevated during osteoblastic activities that's why it is normally elevated in children during periods of growth and, pathologically, in patient's with osteitis deformans. The placental ALP elevates in pregnant women. The…

My story is similar to yours in that we had to give up our beloved pooch, Max, due to living arrangements. We found a fantastic and loving couple who owned their own home and could take Max. We were heartbroken in having to give him up, but we kept in touch via his own Facebook page that they set up for him and all the wonderful photos of him on a paddle board, swimming at the beach and running on the sand, sharing the back seat of the cab-ute with his other house mate and pooch, being bride-dog at their wedding, the fun list goes on and on. One day we asked the couple if we could come visit after a few months and they were delighted. Max took to me and my son immediately and when we were sitting down having afternoon tea, Max would come bounding out of the house through the doggy door and straight onto my lap! We had a wonderful afternoon with them and only thank God that we met such a loving and kind young couple who were able to,take Max. We still have fond memories of Max and he holds a special place in our hearts, as do the young couple.

Wow, even though I am now pescatarian (no meat except seafood) , I enjoyed reading your answer. Wish I knew this when I was a red meat eater! For the life of me I could never cook a good steak! Sooo much salt, however friends of mine who are from Brazil always salted their meats and the cuts and taste were amazing ! Thanks for the thorough explanation and enjoyable read! Do you have a similar method when cooking fish !?! ;-)

Damn right you should smoke indoors with your windows closed. Why should non smokers breathe in your toxic fumes? We have the right to enjoy fresh air, that's what our lungs are made for , FRESH AIR! I have the same problem with a neighbour who moved in next door, all his smoke drifts over to my side where my clean washing is on the line. I HATE IT ! I have respectfully asked him if he could please move somewhere else also because I have a serious heart condition, but he stays and now uses incense sticks thinking that will make it better, pullleez. I am so mad about this as I can't afford to move anywhere else due to being on pension / low income. I am trying to help myself by living a healthy lifestyle, but the inconsiderate tosser next door makes sure that I don't. SMOKERS, PLEASE CONSIDER YOUR NEIGHBOURS, SMOKE WELL AWAY FROM YOUR APARTMENTS, UNITS ETC.

I'm a targeted individual that is going through the suffering of everyday gangstalking I too also am aware of who is stalking me. My question is what can I do, or who do I call to get justice for me, and my children who are the innocent victims of this sick way of abusing, bullying, and harassment. And in my case I have been sexually abused over and over again by this particular obsessed group. I am going to give you some names of who I know to be involved. The first person that is immediately involved as a perpetrator is Terrance “ tuggs” Winfrey age 35 location in Spokane, WA and his family located off of Greene and 4th Ave in Spokane Washington. And his family that is also located in Sacramento, CA as the Grovan family their headquarters are at Pat Grovan's house in her basement. The entire family which happens to be over 30+ members have all taken part in the stalking, harassment, and sexual assault of myself and claimed to have done this to members of my family. They are upset because I don't want to be with one of their family members which happens to be Terrance”tuggs” Winfrey. If there's any added information that you have for me please let me know right away.

Very interesting ways of looking at jealousy and how to not always be so closed minded and negative about the situation because it should be taken as a way to work on yourself in a positive light don't short change yourself and feed that negative approach to jealousy, When embracing the fact that you have this time in your life to reflect on who you are and what you want, minus all the yucky entanglements of emotions, and hatred you have for someone else. Your free from the burden of them having the reins on your emotions. Isn't that something.

Isn't being yourself the reason why you got in this mess in the first place? I know I am not fake or phony and don't have to put on an act for nobody. My emotions are real and I don't sugar coat nothing. But this must be enough to keep some people obsessed with my personality. It almost makes me want to do the opposite of being myself, because maybe it would help all of us out by them being able to learn different things to do instead of obsess over me and would also help me find peace

Very true. I look at men's shoes when I find the man physically attractive. If they have horrible off brand shoes and he's cute I find him less attractive after that. Sometimes I can view that differently as well by having nice shoes or a good unique style it can make the man attractive even if he's not so attractive style is everything.

Why was my thirteen-year-old upset when I told her that she was too old for a birthday party?
Because your a birch for that. Why would you tell your 13 year old she's too old for a birthday party? And then ask why she got upset? Not okay. You probably broke her heart. Wouldn't you want your child to still be a child and be able to do those things for her at any age. What is wrong with you?

I totally agree with you about the rate of speed ppl drive & they love to ride your bumper to get you to move, even police officers do it. It’s very annoying when ppl are walking in the streets holding signs up asking for money. I know which convenient stores to avoid due to this problem. The things that go on here is not just a Baton Rouge problem, this is happening every where. There’s a lot of racism & rude people, but we also have some friendly ppl I've ever met.

I was born & raised in Baton Rouge. I have my moments where I hate living here & times I love it. There’s a lot racism’s here, & some of the schools are awful. L.S.U is a great university, but to me it's a place to party. They have a great football team, but I can care less because I'm not a fan of anything dealing with sports. We also an H.B.U.C ( SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY) with one of the best nursing programs ( my opinion) yaay jags. It's not a lot of stuff to do these days. I don't travel much because I'm a full-time college student, & simply don't have the time. New Orleans is a 60/90 minute drive & one of my favorite places to spend a weekend. There's definitely always something going on in N.O almost every weekend & I love the nightlife there 😊. But honestly if I had it my way I would’ve moved some place else where it snows but my husband not having

1/10 ratio is quite possible for a siege war. Russia only loses more troops at close combats. Some believe the ratio can be 1/20 earlier, before Russia do assaults with melee fights today. But at worse, Russia is quite capable of maintaining 1/7 ratio.

Which race receives the most racism?
I honestly think despite any other race is white. When else can any other decent stand making joke about white guy this or that. Now that’s if you consider every one to be equal and the same at least then to say most every other race except white can’t get a group of all whites together for a movement. Yet black is by far discriminated against more so then any other race. Even there own race trust me I get it but you can’t say racism is the issue, look to understand the bigger picture here. Since so many white people run police etc, most not thinking less of your skin. Some do not like black people and they even see children of 12 years old as adults. It’s because of fear of them.

My daughter use to say my best friend autumn. Now she is saying things like my favorite color is black. What is racism then ? Is it when I look at you to see that white asian or Hispanic guy. No it’s the black guy. Sure they had more crap from police then anyone else, leave it at that. I would rather a future where my daughter was before spring break that never ended saying my best friend is Autumn and not thinking she is black or she is white so you tell me

Yet, all the “Black” Black children that are accepted into these schools has the same or better presentation as the poster. Please stop.Sadly, you are the only one to make it about race. Not surprised. The notion that in 2022, if a Black person is doing well it’s not due to Merit. Tell me how I became successful? Is it because I am Black or is it that I took the same boards as an RN, nurse practitioner and now my Doctor in Nursing Practice to become who I am? Is it because I have a tenacity for business and helping my community, therefore my private practice has grown exponentially in the last two years? Enlighten me..

All to familiar. Imagine the white family who brings the their “lost” teen for a Psychiatry appointment and realize that I’m black. Yet, have heard rave reviews about my practice. Oh, my favorite “you are “Are you a CNA?” My response “No, I’m actually the CNA?”provider.” With a smile.

Hi sir. I have a doubt. I worked as a temporary employee for 1 year in a private clinic and now working in another hospital as a permanent employee for 1 year 8 months. So now I have a total work experience of 2 years 8 months. I had no problem registering for dataflow and DHA exam. But is there any chance that I may be rejected from eligibility because my first year experience was temporary? I still worked as an employee and got salary.

I remember reading another answer which explained the reason is because people only oppose racism only when their particular race is concerned. Each person defends their own race, rather than defending another race. When you defend your own race to the point you oppress another race, that is racism.

Is Satan currently being tortured, suffered, burned in hell?
1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. (He's roaming on the Earth, and clearly not burning in Hell). Job 1:6 One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”. (Again, Satan is roaming the Earth as of now). One thing you must understand- Hell is unoccupied as of now. Sure it exists. But NO ONE is in Hell. When people die, they do not go to Hell or Heaven. Instead, they go to the land of the dead. In other words, they are simply DEAD. Just DEAD. Just that. Ecclesiastes 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but th…

What does the symbol ℞ (Rx) in medical prescriptions and pharmacy stand for?
℞ actually comes from the Greek word Χρήστος (CHRISTOS). (CHRISTOS/ KRISTOS). Christos, a Greek word meaning Anointed is the popular Greek surname for the Hebrew Messiah (CHRISTOS —-> CHRIST), but was not actually used by the Messiah himself nor his followers.
Etymology:

The first two letters are KAI (Χ, pronounced K) and RHO (ρ, pronounced R). It's from these two letters (Χρ) that we get the symbol ℞ (ρx) or RX, which is still used in medicine today (a nod to the Greek origins of Western medicine). So also is the snake and staff symbol used in medicine (again from Greece).

That’s not how Jesus would speak about anyone and you have no right to judge her because you are a sinner too (John 8:7) and you’re no better (Romans 14:1–23). Jesus taught us to love everyone and to be peaceful (1 John 4:16–19), even to those that are not Christian. Please practice what you preach.

My theory is it's a very high sensitivity of clairvoyance, but without support in learning how to control it on a spiritual level and grounding it, it can be destructive.

Do you think most mental health issues are psychic abilities that are uncontrolled? Such as people with OCD and intrusive thoughts are probably picking up on thoughts/energy from spirits or from people around them.

They are tricksters and if they cannot directly attack you, they may find their way through people you care about to try and weaken your spirit. Its so important to pray, meditate, focus on being love, being positive, and have faith because this strengthens your aura and this can shift others around you to a higher frequency as well. Also, when you are aware of their tricks, you hold more power over them.

What is the heaviest and most extreme female-fronted heavy metal band?
Probably brutal deathmetal band Abnormality fronted by Mallika Sundaramurthy. They disbanded in 2020, but she also has her new bands such as Unfathomible Ruination, and Emasculator.
Another new kick ass brutal deathmetal band from USA would also be Castrator:
Another brutal death / grindy band from USA is Harlequin. They started off as a blackened death-thrash band in early days, but are now sounding super brutal in their songwriting:
I’m sure there are many more out there who kick ass. These are just a few I can think of right now. Enjoy! =)

I've had social anxiety since I was a kid and honestly going to school made my anxiety worse, not better and it affected my ability to learn. I felt dumb everyday because I couldn't grasp what the teacher was saying because the anxiety symptoms would get in the way and distract me. But if you put me in a quiet room with less people, or alone, I'd be able to feel more calm and focus better. Everyone is different and learns differently. There is no one size fits all, but for some reason our society thinks it has to shape themselves to fit into the current system, to be one way or no way.
If i was homeschooled, I think I would have done better and got better grades and maybe felt more confident. I think I would have experienced less “trauma” each day (yes when you have anxiety attacks that is you experiencing trauma each time, big or small) your brain learns this as a bad experience which leads to more anxiety when you have to face it again. So exposure therapy, forced to do things you're uncomfortable with (like going to school), is not always the best solution for people with social anxiety.
I think you meant well for child and this is not an attack, but just a perspective. We anxiety sufferers live with this disability and so accomodations would mean the world to us, if we can take a step back from everything so we can calm down, refocus, and try to gain strength to face the next day and have the strength to seek help. I also think it is much harder for us because we live in such a fast paced society, and were not allowed to slow down and process our feelings when we need to. Then people wonder why mental health problems have been increasing. There is so much pressure and demands to succeed in everything. Work and school is important but mental health should always come first.

Is it normal that I have to double check everything before bed? Like the door, or the AC, and right after I check it I have to go back and check a few times again to feel relieved. I’m not sure if it’s normal because I get outta bed for it. Help?
It could be a normal bed time routine, but how you said you have to check it a few times to feel relieved sounds a lot like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior — the vicious cycle of OCD. Obsessions While everyone worries, in people with OCD,…

Yes, in hindsight I realized that I should have told my parents what was going on and I was very, very naive. However, being only 12 years old at the time I sadly didn’t know what abuse really was (especially emotional and sexual abuse) so I didn’t know at the time that anything was wrong. Also, he had me so manipulated that I was scared to tell anyone that what was happening didn’t feel right because I didn’t want him to get in trouble. He had me convinced that he “loved” me and that he was there for me over anyone else.
Years later when I told my mom some of what happened, she told me that at the time it was almost like I was in a trance or was brainwashed because no matter how many times she told me to stop talking to him, I just wouldn’t listen to reason. That’s actually common in abuse victims.
If I could go back and change things, believe me, I would in a heartbeat.
I wish that 12 year old me had been more educated about what behaviors from boys (especially older ones) are okay and what aren’t. Luckily, more schools have programs that discuss sexual abuse now so more children are being taught what is okay and what isn’t when it comes to touches and behaviors from other people.
Thanks for your response.

As a young adult (20) who was a disrespectful and sassy 12 year old daughter myself, I would try to calmly sit down and talk to her and let her know that you’re there for her. I’d ask her what’s going on and explain to her that you don’t appreciate how she’s been acting and that you took her phone as a result of her behavior. All behaviors have consequences and punishing her for being disrespectful and rude is fine. But my guess is that something is causing her to act the way she is. I can tell you that I and many friends I know greatly valued privacy at that age, and she may have lashed out because she felt her privacy was violated when you took her phone. Maybe ask her if that’s why she got so upset when you took it as a punishment. I always had an attitude at that age because I was feeling so much and going through so much. I had undiagnosed anxiety until I was 16 which came with depressive episodes and I was self harming and felt suicidal regularly. I was also being bullied and sexually/emotionally abused. All of these were things my parents didn’t know about so they didn’t understand why I was in emotional turmoil and being so defensive and rude to them. I didn’t feel like I could talk to them about it and when they would get frustrated with me and get angry at me for being so upset all the time it made me feel like they would never understand and that I was all alone. I’d shut myself away in my room and just wanted to be alone and seemingly never wanted to interact with them. And when they made me interact with them, I was negative and kept to myself the whole time. When they’d ask what was wrong and why I was being so rude I would immediately get defensive and get an attitude because I felt attacked. Does that sound familiar? If so, and if she won’t talk to you about whatever may be going on, I would recommend looking into a therapist or mental health professional. Even if it’s not something like anxiety or depression, your daughter may be having a tough time dealing with emotions and feelings that come with being 12 and puberty. I know that for myself, my hormones were all over the place and I just didn’t know how to cope with that. Therapists can be for everyone and don’t have to be a forever thing. Everyone can use some help coping with the stress of life sometimes and believe it or not, being a 12 year old girl can be very stressful. Now, I’d also like to mention that as a parent you do have the right to go through your daughter’s phone and see if anything is going on. And doing that may end up being necessary. However, if you choose to do that please seek professional advice on how to go about that in a healthy way because it can be really traumatizing to the child. When my parents wanted to search my phone when I was younger it was incredibly stressful for me because even though I knew that they owned the phone and had a right to, that was one of the only things I had as a teen where I had a certain amount of privacy expected and them demanding to search it felt violating. I think it’s really easy for parents to forget that it’s important that their kids need a certain amount of privacy too as another human being. I hope any of this helps and I hope that things work out soon with your daughter. Best of luck to you.

What?? I never said to subscribe to me what are you talking about lol. This is the very first time in like the three years I’ve been a member of quora that I posted something and regretfully so! I never post or answer anything I’m just someone interested in reading things from knowledgeable people. Unfortunately, not everyone on here who answers questions are knowledgeable of the subject…. ahem…. anyways, I don’t owe you a name or a profile picture and it doesn’t make me any less human just because I don’t show those things. And no need to project your lack of substance onto me, which appears so obviously in your “writing”.

Lol. And I’ve seen many people like you who structure their sentences and say certain words against borderlines like you do. The point is I was just trying to help you see something I felt you weren’t noticing and that maybe you were answering some questions incorrectly because of your negative experience. But yes I realize now my words have fallen on deaf ears and you are determined that everything you say is correct and that anything I say is discredited because I have bpd. But you’re entitled to your opinions, I just thought I could get some kind of proper response from you but you responded in the way I was afraid you would. So I understand now there was no point in trying to talk with you to try to help you understand that all the things you write about borderlines aren’t correct. I am not implying that everything you say is wrong, what I am saying though is that some of the things you say are wrong. It doesn’t matter if you’re an asshole about it or sugar coat it, I don’t care about that, that wasn’t my point… what I care about is that some of the things you’ve written are incorrect therefore spreading misinformation. And if multiple people have told you this before perhaps it’s not us that’s wrong, it’s you lol.

Look, Jason, i initially read your response to this question then ventured over to your profile and saw numerous answers you gave regarding bpd questions. It feels like you have a biased view on borderlines because of your negative experience with a bpd person. I completely understand why you’re so angry and why you feel like bpd individuals are “shitty”. However, it’s important to remember that just like there are “normal” people who are shitheads and who are not, the same goes for borderlines. I understand there are people diagnosed with this disorder that do have bad intentions and who don’t care about the suffering they inflict on to others, perhaps for those kinds of people it is too late for them, I have met those types of people before. This can be said about anyone suffering from anything, not just bpd. Some people, in general, aren’t good people at heart. That being said, and I cannot stress this enough, NOT ALL BORDERLINES ARE BAD PEOPLE. There are borderlines out there that have tried so hard to get better. Some have and some are still on that path. They do not get enjoyment from being the way they are. They don’t get enjoyment from being mentally ill and from seeing their loved ones suffer because of their unintentional wrong-doings. It may sound silly coming from me but, it’s not so black and white. I don’t want to be this way. I do whatever I can to get better. Getting better has become a life long journey. And in order for this bad stigma to go away that’s associated with those who have borderline, it is crucial that people like you don’t spread hate. Whether you see it or not, I am telling you your post sounded hateful. And you have every right to be hateful towards a person who hurt you or affected you so negatively. But to group everyone together and assume that all borderlines fit into one giant shitty person category is wrong to do. You may be stuck with the thoughts you have towards bpd people because of your experience with them, and nothing I, or anyone says will change your mind. That’s fine. I understand what its like to be so sure of something. But because you’ve never experienced it yourself, as in you actually having it, it may be near impossible for you to truly know the magnitude of how this disorder feels. I may have trouble with my thoughts and emotions but I’m still a decent person with morals and values and try to be as non judge mental as possible. My personal relationships are chaotic and I have many deep issues I need to understand still to hopefully get past this. Maybe I never will. But please, if you want to answer questions about bpd, please don’t spread misinformation. Please read non-biased information about bpd. And if you can’t be un-biased, please don’t spread hate and lies. Not every bpd is the person who hurt you.

I disagree because he will find out. It may not be now or in a few years but something will slip. If she is cheating she is not committed to the relationship. I know what I speak I lived it. Yes it hurts and is devestating but so is being deceived and finding out after the fact. He deserves someone who does not lie to his face. Hurt now or later? You sound like you have either been cheated on or are doing the cheating. That's my philosophy on the subject. If you are going behind your spouses back there is a serious breakdown in the marriage. One can recover but it's not fair to keep the other in the dark to “spare” their delicate feelings. You give the person being deceived absolutely no credit he/she can't handle it.

I’m preganant with my brother’s baby. He’s so hot and I like his muscles. It was consensual but an accident. Our mom walked in on us but she was on meth so I don’t think she saw. I feel like if I tell her, she’ll get mad at me. What do I do?
‍♀️RUN AWAY FAST - your mother is not supposed to be on Meth she is supposed to be taken care of you and you are not supposed to be having SEX with your Brother PERIOD there are plenty of good guys with muscles. You’re family is off limits have some control , No No all wrong and now you’re pregnant, what will a child that will have to endure life,with a meth grandma and a UncleDad… I think you’re being taken advantage of here life has more to offer you sweetheart

I also received genetic testing and was told my son would have Down syndrome and I would have to have doctors there when I delivered. I was so devestated because I already had children that were healthy and didn’t know how they would receive him and I did consider not having him but I prayed and prayed and even faced the fact that I would have a child that was special needs but as I kept going to my appointments every week his ultrasounds begins to turn normal and was born completely healthy. I thank god everyday . He is 5 now and about to start school this year, yes I know 5 but he will probably be my last child so I wanted to spend all the extra time I can with him.

What are the temperature control features of Instacart's delivery vehicles? How do they compare to those of Amazon Flex and Postmates?
Instacart does not have a fleet of delivery vehicles. They do not send out “temperature controlled” company cars or trucks at all. When you order through Instacart, the order gets sent out to independent contractors (aka: Moms, Dads, students, neighbors, anyone who needs extra income can sign up to SHOP & deliver for Instacart). When that order gets picked up, that person will drive their own vehicle to the store, park, go inside & shop for the items on your list, go to checkout, wait in line, bag your groceries, load them back into their personal vehicle, drive to your home, unload all bags & carefully leave them at your doorstep. Would you like to know the average pay for someone who is doing all that work AND driving their OWN vehicle? I can tell u that it’s barely enough to cover the gas…

Can you add items to an Instacart order after it's been placed but before delivery has occurred?
Yes, in fact, the Instacart app will send you a push notification after the order has been placed (but before its been picked up by a shopper) that asks you if there is anything else youd like to add. The app will also show you items to buy based on your previous order history. If your order is already being shoppe...

Can’t we do better….for Dixie and all the others?
Author Unknown “I was leaving the dollar store today and the cute little lady in front of me , alll dressed up, was struggling. She didn’t know her PIN number at the register. The man behind me kept sighing and said “Come ON” while the cashier and I tried to help her. When she was trying to leave, she asked for help trying to get the cart out the door because it had a big pole on it to prevent people from taking the carts out. I explained that they weren’t allowed outside and that I could help her. She immediately declined but looked out at the parking lot and then back at all her bags. “Really,” I said, “I would love to help.” She said, “Oh I couldn’t do that. You might not even be parked near me!” Seriously? When walking out with her, I learned her name was Dixie and she was 83 and stopped in after church and the grocery store. “These errands wear my old body out!” She sighed as we loaded the bags into car. The part that made me so sad was when I finished and shut the trunk, she asked me how much she owed me. I laughed and answered but she said, “No, I must pay you!”. Obviously, I declined and told her to have a beautiful day BUT how tragic is it that she thought she should pay me to walk with her to her car. Sparklers, we must do better. We must be proactive, bolder and deliberate with our kindness. We are failing our elderly. We are failing our young ones who will only know a world such as this. We are failing each other. Step up and go outside of your comfort zone today and just spark. Seriously! Oh…and invite your friends worldwide to our group so we can set this world on fire with GOODNESS.” Author: Unknowns Source: Let’s Spread the Kindness

60 Minutes had a hit piece on Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, but failed to disclose these facts: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the US Naval Reserve Center in Dallas Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant junior grade, to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a Lieutenant Commander in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal. He represented Florida's 6th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018. Obviously, with these qualifications, he is NOT qualified to be a Democrat, or serve in a senior political position in our nation’s capital when one considers and compares the credentials of Pelosi, Schumer, Harris or Biden. He has kept Florida free of the grip of a tyrannical federal government while our State of Florida still prospers, which is why more people have moved to Florida than any other state for the last couple years. So, for anyone who criticizes him, I have a request of you. Can you please post your education and service to our country in a resume so we can compare and put your opinion in perspective? THIS, my fellow Americans is the greatest Governor in our nation! I hope 2028 we find him in the White House...right after VP to Trump in 2024

Do Instacart drivers see ratings?
Yes, we do see our ratings, not only do we see them, a bad rating can greatly damage our ability to see future potential orders in the Instacart app. The orders we do see, if our rating falls below a 4.70, are usually the orders that no one else wants to take such as driving to the store for one random item & then getting stuck delivering the item 30 miles away with no tip. There is an upside to this, if an instacart shopper consistently receives bad ratings then it’s a great way to “weed them out” which means more orders available for the shoppers who are actually good at their job & passionate about top notch customer service!

Would Instacart retain a contractor if they only wish to shop & deliver two or three times per week?
Yes, absolutely. That is the great thing about “gig” work! You’re an independent contractor, Instacart does not extend an offer of employment. If you are able to pass the background check & have a clean driving record then you’re able to download the app to begin accepting orders. You’re welcome to log on anytime that is convenient for YOU. Once you’re logged on, the orders will show up for stores near your location. You’ll see how much the job will pay before you ever take the order. You can work once a day, once a week, once a month or all day every day; they don’t care, they just want a shopper to take the offers so that the customers get their groceries in quality condition and a timely manner which is partly why the customers keep ordering which is how we have more orders to fulfill,…

I'm his fiancee now and we been together for three years ,so yeah your right it doesn't concern me because I wasn't dating him at the time of all the chaos,I started dated him years later. me and him love each other as we should but if your my man and you love me like you say you do?why do I have to pay double because I have no dental ins. like she has with him ?their child is 18 so the bitch shouldn't be in the picture and getting support by my soon to be husband when I should be getting the discount because he is with me, should have been stopped when their divorce was finalized.she has been over.no disrespect but she doesn't deserve shit in all honesty.thanks

I don’t know if it’s comfort, it’s what I’ve seen while working in the field of behavioral health. I’m sorry that presenting it in a matter-of-fact way is disturbing to you. There was typically an incident that led to them being there, either a threat to harm someone else or themselves. Being placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold is a process that requires more than just conjecture; evidence is needed for that hold.

Hi Manny, I appreciate you explaining a lot of these intricacies. (This is not sarcasm, I know it’s hard to tell over the internet). But you did a really good job of making this easy for someone who is not super well-versed on these issues to understand. I appreciate that.

My mom’s favorite to use on me: “if you would just try harder…..”
If I would just try harder what? Will my brain chemistry change? My genetics? (Granted I do realize a certain level of “trying” is needed in order to develop coping skills and emotional regulation skills).
The assumption that I am NOT trying is insulting. This is me trying.

…thank you to the person who already said “ok boomer”, but may I reiterate: “OK BOOMER”.
Sir, I have no idea if you are a baby boomer or not, but your comment sounds very inline with something a baby boomer would say about the Millennial Generation.
Were all of the Millennials who VOLUNTARILY signed up for the military immediately following 9/11 doing so because they knew “no hardship, pain, or suffering”?
OR were all the Baby Boomers who had to get DRAFTED demonstrating their lack of desire to go through “hardship, pain, and/or suffering”.
Have some respect for your Millennials.

100 truth. The Gambino's primarily own Long Island and also have a significant presence in Rochester, Miami, some neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn along with sprouting up in Los Angeles and other parts of California. The Genovese have control over pretty much all upstate New York outside of Rochester and The Arms Turf. The Genovese are also VERY VERY dominant around Portland in Oregon which is why the Russian mob (who own that territory) are at war with them now. The Latinos are also at a turf war with parts of The Outfit and more specifically the Genovese/Lucianos in Chicago. Many of the things that the Feds say on the news is false! The Mafia is still around and have a much different kind of influence then they used to. They infiltrated parts of law enforcement on Long Island in order to have a heads up on arrests for their guys and associates. They infiltrated parts of the FBI Office in Upstate New York for the same reason. The Genovese have a significant amount of family members in the Southwest part of the country who are either in the military or are ex-military. Many of the things they used to do mutated into things like mortgage fraud, identity theft, credit card skimming, COVID-19 assistance program fraud, tax fraud and other white collar crimes because they carry much less jail time.
The Mafia is evil.

United Blood Nation.
The West Side signed itself out of the UBN. And that's, not the East Side’s problem.
The founder of the Bloods which was founded in LA, was incarcerated in Rikers with a high ranking member of the Lucchese Family. When the Families didn't want him, they exiled him to LA. From that animosity he had towards The Families he found an excuse to find another Gang “to protect the Blood Families from the Crips”. The same founding statement of La Cosa Nostra and La Camorra from 800 years prior.

Involved? You're Funny! The Gambino Family uses the Bloods Gang to do all of its hits even to this day! They would never throw one of their own under the bus unless they were a snitch! The Lucchese Family and it’s founder were in prison with the Founder of the Bloods in Rikers so they share a very special bond. The Crips are closer with the Lucianos and Genovese on the West Coast and in Chicago. Whereas, Luccheses and Gambinos are very close with the Bloods in New York and on the East Coast. In General, the Italian Mafia has allowed people in the Bloods and Crips to marry into their Families under certain circumstances like when their is strategic value. So to answer your question, their are affiliated but not always on a personal level and more on a business level.

It's a blessing to be gay. Gays dress better, have better jobs, make more money, are generally better people, happier, when they get married they appreciate it more, better style and cook better - just to name a few. Be who you are.

Why do you forgive that people are bad?
Some people like to call it good and bad people. Every good person does bad things and every bad person does good things. It's better to look at life as people who honor life and people who do not honor life. If someone got into a car accident and hit the divider in the middle of the night on the highway with no one around except you driving by would you call 911? Or get out and help? Both are things you would say a good person would do. Think about it my way and it opens up a whole new world.

It's very true what I said. Based upon the history of the Italian people. And yes, there are many other organized criminal syndicates out there but the Sicilian Mafia has the most publicity. And yes I'm from New York but my views aren't distorted at all. Everything I said is true which is supported by historical facts. I didn't add the Moor influence in there and many others facts as well because it's 2019 and we have electric here not gas lamps.

I'm Northern Italian and I've dated quite a few Sicilians. I can tell you THEIR IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TYPES OF PEOPLE. First off, the Sicilian people hated us (as portrayed in the Sopranos) because we were the Italian (pronounced E-TA-AL-EE-ON) people first hence why we say we're Italian and they say there Sicilian. Sicily was the first melting pot of the world (before America and actually was the idea for America) and a sanctuary place because the Sicilian people were pretty much thrown out of Italy because of the way they are. They were (and still are by some) considered to be dirty people for a number of reasons (not including their La Cosa Nostra and our Camorra aka The Mafia) mostly because of their darker (nigger) skin tone, whore mentalities, mistresses and vulgar language (WH…

It's a war between the real and the genuine. New York just happens to be in the constant spotlight. I was born here and have lived all over New York. I can say that Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse and Niagara Falls are all cities in New York - much different. People don't sound like they ate a box of tissues for breakfast. People might be fake nice but that's better than ruining someone's day by ripping their face off if you don't care about them. “Your such a good person”, “your such a nice person"", “your such a sweet person”. Get used to that in the beginning when you move here. That's normal. And being attacked outside your building for no reason at all. Could write the book about New York. How they (we) say people envy us for some reason any reason because we have more money then others. But really at the end of the day, they (we) are the first ones to be corrupt, abuse our power and cover it up, more corrupt cops have been charged by grand juries in New York than any other state. And hey they have pretty great food, awesome transportation, weather sucks, it's a ton of people all the time competing who takes a better shit in the toliet. It's a great place IF you need social services, have a ton of money or to work. Other than that LA, Chicago, London, Paris, Perth, Miami and Portland have better weather, nicer people and GOOD FOOD.

How do guys become gay?
The science says were born gay BUT personally I believe their are 3 types of guys that have sex with other guys. One is the obvious, attraction to men or being homosexual. The second, which is more common than you think, is when a younger doesn't have someone to look up to or to be like when they get older. Like their father wouldn't be there friend outside of being their father. Their father was not someone to look up to. Whatever else. The younger lost and find somebody who's teaches them lessons about life through taking something from them they can never get back. This happens A LOT in jails, contruction, masculine jobs and the military. It's also where the “absued becomes the abuser"" psychology was made. It's the predator and prey mentality. Some guy couples enjoy this too but, it's d…

I caught my 13 year old daughter using pads for her period without my permission. What do I do now?
I feel like this has to be a joke? If not then you, mother, need your head examined. You cannot possibly expect your daughter to bleed out when it's that time of month, onto her clothing. When my daughter was 13, she came to me and asked if she could start using tampons bc she hated the sight of blood so I went and got her some small ones and then had the talk about how long to leave them in and what not and tried to the best of my ability to explain to her the best way to insert it. You are your daughter's mother. You should be her advocate. You shouldn't have had to catch her, because she should have been comfortable enough to come to you and ask. If she can't ask you something as simple as this, then what can she talk to you about? Nothing? Do better. This is exactly why we have parent…

My husband threatened to hit me. What should I do?
Wait until he leaves for work or falls asleep and run and never look back. If he threatened it, that was just to test the waters to see if you will stay. If you stay, he will definitely do it. Sooner than later. If you don't have any money, check domestic abuse centers in your area. If you have kids together, make sure you get them to safety as well.

I will tell you what I've told my son numerous times. If a girl hits you, make space between yourself and her and keep it that way. An abusive partner, no matter the gender, is uncalled for. If they have to put their hands on you, clearly they're not the one. Move along.

If a man hits you, does he love you?
Absolutely not. It took me a lot of years and losing almost everything I had to realize this. My kids father hit me the first time when I was pregnant with his child and told me it would never happen again. Well it did! And again and again and again. I would leave and he would beg me back. After so long he thought that I would come back, no matter what he did to me. So, needless to say, it got worse. To the point of me losing everything I had, but him. And really, I didn't have him. He cheated with my friend and that was the straw for me. I was done after that. I blocked him out of every part of my life and only gave him an opportunity to see his kids, thru my parents.

Do you still live with her? And if so why not moving out? If your mom still beats you up, I'd bet she's done it your whole life, meaning she is the problem. Not you. Get away from her. I'm all for respecting parents, but I do know there are some lousy parents out there, that don't deserve to be called a parent. Don't let that control your life. There is a great big world out there, full of loving, caring people. Leave and don't look back and never ever let history repeat itself.

I'm 90 days sober from a five year meth addiction. I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and struggle to do things. When will it get easier and what can I do to feel better?
It took about a year for me to start to feel better (I slept a lot). It has been an uphill battle, but worth it ultimately, as I could not live any longer as I was.

I'm right there with you. I was with Bernie in 2016, but had to go with Hillary against Trump in the general election. Don't think Bernie is the best candidate to go against Trump if we want Trump out of the White House. Really liking Buttigieg & feel he could not only hold his own against the orange one, but replace him as POTUS. Bottom line for me, regardless of which Democratic candidate wins the Primary, is that candidate will be where my vote is going, for the sake of our country.

How does your anger affect your relationships?
Man. My anger at my junky tweeker ex is so bad that the woman I use to love is now who I send the most vile hurtful messages to and it’s tsking me down a dark hole. My energy is down and it’s pouring into the rest of my life. Anger is good when you take the lesson on why you are feeling it. It’s causing me to want to destroy her but I’m hurting myself in the process.

What is your review of Bremerton, WA?
Bremerton is a navy town. Ship port to be exact. It’s old. Run down for the most part. Lack of good jobs and rampant meth use that had already wreaked havoc in the early 90s. When we were young all we did was get into trouble. Bremerton is really a dump.

What are baby steps you can start taking to start loving yourself and what you look like?
If there are things you don’t like about yourself that you CAN change then tackle one thing at a time. Take something little that is easier and fix it. Celebrate your victory and then tackle something else that you will make you feel better about yourself. Baby steps. Accept the things you can not change and be the best most confident you that you can be!

What are some good coping mechanisms to stop someone from relapsing?
You can’t stop anyone from relapsing. For one, you cant make anyone do anything. For two relapsing is part of the process so they say, not sure what they might relapse on, but a few things are nasty, life and soul consuming and its an ongoing battle for life I have heard.
You can encourage and support them, let them know you care and help them see there is a different option.

What is the most unusual synchronicity or message from the universe you've had on your spiritual awakening?
For me it was one night when I was using my pendulum. I was watching myself in the mirror and made a strong connection with my higher self. I asked why I talk to myself like sharing my day and ideas. Myself told me it’s because I am my own best friend. Then I told me that I validate me. It changed the whole game.

What is something you want to ""get off your chest""?
I feel somewhat guilty for wanting the worst for my addict ex. Since she decided to keep using dope I want her to go so hard that she wont ever come back. I want the heroin and meth to engulf her soul and leave her wallowing in a black bottomless heroin abyss. It makes me angry but also sad I would have these feelings. My life is so good now, yet when I feel low or angry I think of her and wish nothing but her self inflicted demise.

For me it was easy. I thought things like using heroin was an instinctual no no like touching a stove. My ex began Heroin who really knows when. I looked around and you don’t even have to dig deep to see what it destroys. That is why I tried to shame her. It made no sense. I fucking hate drugs. I did lots and lots of drugs growing up. Just stopped. The lifestyle, the people, the loss, the hopelessness, the dark aybss, watching my spouse degrade. Becoming vile and toxic myself berating her over it. It was awful. It was easy to not become an addict. But I was very much an addict myself. Addicted to her addiction. In many ways she had a valid excuse. I was simply operating like an addict in darkness of my own choosing. I isolated myself. I lost much of what the addict does. She just got to stuff those feelings with drugs. So while I did not do drugs, I was very much an addict. It was the breaking point in which I changed my own life.

Same for me. I think about it multiple times a day. I feel hopeless, like the future will be terrible and I don’t want to be here for that. It’s like I’m too tired to continue trying and battling life. I constantly wonder how people would feel, would they be shocked? Feel remorse? Or would my death just be another random thing that happened ? For a moment, I’m comforted in knowing that they will think about me for just a minute.
The funny thing is, I don’t think I ever could. I’m scared of dying , just the same as I’m scared of life. Feeling like a failure, or that I’m wasting away my best years. Who knows.

I feel exactly the same way. I’m 27 and have been this way for as long as I can remember. The thought of living the rest of my life like this is depressing. I’m lonely. I do have 1 good friend that I trust and that I’m sure won’t abandon me. But I feel like I will never find a partner. I’ve tried really hard to get out there and meet guys, but they always end up hurting me. Nobody wants to be in a real relationship with me. My father died a couple of years ago, very suddenly. And my mother is very sick and needs help, life is overwhelming to say the least. You’re not alone.

I couldn’t add more details due to character limits. But obviously those qualities I described are just the first things you see in someone and do not describe me entirely as a person. I’m not looking for someone that’s just pretty, I want someone I can share my thoughts, feelings and aspirations. But I feel like I never get the chance to share more about me because guys end things after a few weeks or they ghost me.

This person appears to be asserting that a large big toe relative to the other toes may be an indication of ""nervous weakness"" that the person is attempting to conceal, maybe by being inconspicuous or avoiding drawing attention to themselves. Just to be clear, here is no scientific evidence to support the notion that the size or form of a person's toes is related to their personality or behavior in any manner.

What is the meaning of Romans 12:19-21?
It is surprising how difficult this passage is for Christians to understand, although it is straightforward when you read it with an open mind. Paul is saying not to seek revenge against your enemies. Paul makes a vague allusion to Deuteronomy 32:35, saying that any revenge should be left to God. He then says that if we go out of our way to be good to those we consider enemies, helping them in any way possible, we will cause them to suffer burning shame (“coals of fire”) with greater effect than any revenge is likely to achieve. He summarises: Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil with good.

My Son joined right out of high school, went 0311, it was tough but he really felt like he was where he was suppose to be, it was home for him. He then was selected for MSG, passed the course and did some Embassy time, then was selected to a FAST Team which he seems to like too, but his sense of loyalty is… and always will be with the Infantry no doubt. One builds a bond, a sense of loyalty and a deep appreciation/understanding for what sacrifice and commitment means for the betterment of the guy next to you, the Corp’s and service to (and for) our nation.That life lesson can be well worth the investment of what one would put into it and conversely what one would get out of there experiences’.
However, there is something to be said about acquiring skills through other POG MOS’s, the VA working as it should and the fact you are left to pickup the pieces once your out. Though my son has had… and friends of his have had offers with major corporations offering them employment as soon as they get out for 6 figure security contracts both privet sector as well as Government both in country and out. So I see it as… make the best out of whatever you decided to do. Your training will help you move forward in life if you embrace the training use it as your weapon to go out there and make your way in this world.
And as a (Combat-Veteran myself} who served in the ARMY and have had more experience with the VA and society in general than most on the subject. I agree with the OP on his assessment of what really happens to the Vet’s here at home after all the hard work, sacrifice and hardships left for you and your loved ones to deal with can be extremely challenging. It’s a fight all the way through life, why not get to see some of the world on there dime and pick up what you can to get a running start when exit the service. As one E-8 MARINE said to me the other day, “It beats working at Wall-Mart”. Give it a shot if you apply yourself there is no telling where you might end up because there’s always opportunity if you look for it.

AGREED: Solid Perspective on Reality! Contrary to a lot of people’s belief’s, As a Veteran who has experienced/participated in a coup/take-over Military Coup/Take-Over of Government and repatriation of it’s population, it’s population. It’s my contention that it is… very possible that if the extreme shift of the Ult-Left continues to push this narrative of extremism ideology, extremism/ideology and propaganda, “our way or we all burn” type mentality, we will see those who are now understanding (maybe for the first time) it’s now or never to rise and save what’s left of this Republic and that for which it stands… they (we) very well could loose everything if they we don’t fight back with equal or greater force “you force. I believe we will end up in a civil war for a number of reasons, and I know from experience, “Sometimes it takes a wolf to kill a wolf”. The sheep dogs aren’t getting it done against this uprising of the kind of violence we are experiencing from the extreme left today. The kinds of mass rioting and civil disobedience directed at our current President, who is the legitimate Elected Government Official, is (in my eye’s) Treason and puts all of us at risk if it’s not stopped and stopped quickly. Whatever it takes to get these unruly masses under control must and ultimately will be a wolf to kill a wolf”, just being a sheep dog won’t get it done.done or we will all suffer the consequences.

I’d rather be in a foxhole with someone that wanted to join, than someone who was guilted by a total stranger on the internet, and called a coward. I think it takes quite a bit of courage to profess you made a mistake and don’t want to serve.

That’s a fair and reasonable question brother, and I’m glad you’re at least willing to consider another candidate, if available. I’m a lifelong registered republican, gun owner, combat infantryman , a Texan, and hell I have a shaved head, a beard, and beer belly! I am the stereotypical dream demographic of a Trump follower by all visual, and assumed standards. I shamefully admit I voted for Trump in 2016 for the mere fact that he represented the least of two evils (Hillary). I just as shamefully did not vote for either candidate in 2020, and will be voting 3rd party or write in “deez nutz” in November’24.
Trump ain’t no republican brother, he has masterfully found inroads to a usually silent majority(?) and manipulated that disenfranchised group of Americans to a fever pitch, he’s a genius by no means, but rather a shrewd manipulator of basic human nature of a certain demographic.
Biden is not a viable option either, trumps meteoric rise to prominence was a set of dumb luck, perfect opportunities represented by 2 of the worst polarizing democratic candidates that folks hate so much they will vote for anything that is the polar opposite of these two democrats.
I’m 55 and have never witnessed a hatred filled, vitriol controlled constituency anything near what Trump has created.
Ive never feared a constituency until trumps creation, I can take care of myself, but trump owns the golden dog-whistle. I’m sure a large majority of my associates, combat brothers, and general public will continue in goose step admiration for him.
I’m not hearing anyone of his followers saying things like “Trump is a mess but Biden isn’t a better choice,” people are “convinced” that Trump is the best candidate ever?!
Human nature, unfortunately, is very easy to manipulate in large groups, Trump has rewritten the book in this arena…I don’t even wish ill will on Trump…I’m also looking for an alternative to the two jokes that the “powers that be” have decided are the best choices.

Thank you for being a bright light in an otherwise pit of darkness. You could have easily looked the other way, ignored, or even added to their mental anguish. You chose to show compassion to souls who have no hope or even understand why or where they’re at. I wish blessings on you and hope you realize the blessings you brought to your fellow inmates, you did this for no other reward than that of knowing you were helping unfortunate souls, while you yourself was suffering the same hell. I am certain your acts will be rewarded in this life or when you pass into eternity. Bless you.

How did you get a revised bipolar diagnosis, as in being considered ""not bipolar""?
Hmm, I think the only way that can happens is if you're misdiagnosed in the beginning. There is no reversing of a correctly diagnosed bipolar human being; no pill, no special diet, no exercise regimen will “reverse” the correctly diagnosed case of bipolar disorder. However, one can function quite well with said diagnosis, in and among society, if she/he will be compliant with meds, get on normal sleep schedule and normal schedule in general, find good counseling, and know their “""warning signs” (thoughts, moods, triggers etc), and enlighten oneself with cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) when you sense a warning sign. Things won't always be great, but as with all battles in life, arm yourself well and you enhance the probability of success….or successes, as you will have back slides…..and be…

God how I wish this were so, but my experience with bi-polar is you have both depression and mania. Dunno maybe someone out there is different, but it's called “bi”-polar for a reason.

What are LGBT+ people tired of hearing?
“So, when did you choose to be gay?” My response is always “When did you choose to be straight?” the look on their faces is priceless! Haha. Also, when men preach that they're against homosexuals and then say “It's only okay if it's just girl on girl.” Then proceed to ask if they can watch or join.” HA. Men that act like that should have no right to vote against gay marriage. When men talk about how disgusting gay men are in terms of how they male love..Like, really bitch! Who cares bc love is love and if they dont agree they should just keep their mouth shut bc it does not affect their life what. so. ever. The funniest one is when they ask “how do lesbians have sex?” welp if they had to ask that then I feel sorry for whoever is dating them. Lol I could go on for days.

I'm pretty sure this anonymous muslim is just an undercover hindutva guy idealising BJP and their unjust culling of muslim minorities in India. India have been nothing but absolute shit head. They spread rumors regarding Bangladesh, they spread rumors about homes of muslim cricketers that were burned and made it seem like it was hindu household, just to paint a wrong picture in media and many more. And I can vouch that the “rape muslim women and make India Hindu again” is a BJP punchline, not muslim, but the punchline of hindu extremists. I have no respect for them, and just a few days back they opened a dam in the middle of the night without prior notice and flooded many district in Bangladesh, and many people died, hindu and muslims boths. Where is their humanity now? Domestic violence is something requiring attention despite all religions, and this guy is nothing but spewing bullshit besides bathing in it.

Dude, in what world XD your personal experience does not total the whole tall woman demographic. In fact, it is you all “short queens” who are after the tail of tall women, as is evident from all these answers: “size of a man” “The Hulk” psst grow up (pun intended) you guys sound so immature trying to fit in your demographic in these answers. And you sound like a “pick me” by creating divides based on your imaginary feuds with tall women. We don’t really give a damn.

I feel like a waste of space. I’m 18 years old and life feels like it's passing by. I can't achieve anything. I want to die soon. I’m depressed, but I can't tell anyone. They think I'm looking for attention and I should get over it. What should I do?
What helped me during those bleak, hazy days when dying felt like the easy way out was knowledge. Not the text book knowledge that comes with truckload of stress. I’m talking about the out of syllabus ones. I watched Youtube videos like the ones from khan academy, veritaseum, ted-ed and button poetry. They were my lullaby, they told me of places my thought didn’t yet wander to. And it was vivifying, for me. You don’t exactly have to abandon your computer, you could simply use it for something new, something better. Plus-point, you could watch those videos indoors. I also try to uplift others, like I’m doing now. In turn, it uplifts me, as if I was consoling myself all along. Through that, you’ll discover the hidden optimism in you, which will surprise you in a good way. These are two simple rec…

How can you forgive an ex partner for dating your close friend for 3 years after you divorced? They did not work out and now my ex partner wants to consider remarriage. How can I let go of the resentment and anger? Should I?
They have crossed the line and Carried on up the hill! They have both used up all your trust in relationships and friendships, leave both of them to rot and find new people or enjoy your own self like you've had too. They will have damaged your trust in everything you ever knew. Why bother they will do it again as they know NO boundaries!

Should a parent watch over their 8-year-old child whilst bathing if the child keeps coming out of the bath covered in soap? What if the kid feels embarrassed about the parent seeing their privates?
Depends. My daughter is 8 years old and just completed a mile stone of taking a shower solo. I told her her that it’s time to see if she could successfully shower without assistance. It went well. She was concerned she might not have rinsed a 100% but that’s okay. She is learning and will get better over time with verbal reminders. She does like me to wash her back but today I told her to do her best. Ask your 8 year old if he/she would like help. If they answer no, respect that boundary. Verbally remind them what to wash and rinse well. If there is soap or conditioner in the hair that is obviously hard to hide, have the child get back in there and rinse A second time. It’s inconvenient for them to do so especially when they want to do something else. To be honest…If I had not rinsed well en…

The generation of people who went to blockbuster and RadioShack, what was it like?
My answer comes in the form of Blockbuster goer perspective. I have been to a RadioShack back in the day. Like childhood days mostly for my brother, who loved building and racing rc cars. I remember going to Blockbuster as a teenager and young adult. You knew it was the weekend cause I would get to pick movies that I could not see in the theater. It was great because that meant pizza night too! You would go hoping you got a copy of the movie you wanted. Newest movies released would be sitting 20–30 copies thick. I remember when it was like 10 copies of the latest and greatest. It was great browsing movies in real life. You happened upon movies you forgot about, or movies you loved a kid. You call to your significant other to tell them all about it hoping they will want to watch it with you.…

My daughter does the same. She says to me and my husband, I miss you. This happens all the time. He could run an errand and be gone for 10 min. As soon as he walks through the door she behaves as if he had been gone for days. She says I love you all the time too. By ‘all the time’ I do mean like every couple of hours. She needs constant reassurance.
For example: My husband works 12 hours 3–4 days a week. While he is gone this is our typical conversation.
4 year old: Daddy’s at work today?
Me: Yes, he is working today?
4 year old: He is coming home?
Me: Yes, after work he is coming home?
4 year old: I miss him.
Me: I know you miss, but he is going to come home.
An hour or two later this conversation will be repeated throughout the day.
Then dad walks through the door.
4 year old: Daaaaaaaaaddy! I missed you! You were at work today? I love you!
I think Mr. Flom said it. My daughter needs constant reassurance about where dad happens to be at the moment. She is very much a daddy’s girls and a mother hen. Mother hens need to know where everyone is at that very moment.
As annoying as this might be right now just amuse her with you answer. No one is getting hurt. You are strengthening your bond and relationship with her. Its beautiful!

Thank you, I really needed to read this right now. I've been there, lost, and am in recovery. Some days are ok and some are overwhelming..I'm having one of those days when you realize how trapped you and your kids are, and that there is no escape from the trap that was set into motion before even meeting the person. It's literally nothing to do with me, but I feel like I'm being force-fed someone else's bullshit. It's a lot to swallow.

Wow, what a change from my experience of a MALE child protection (officer), who unsurprisingly, sided with the father, and together they've sought to take me back to the 1960s. It's so, so bleak.

I went through this too recently, but with eyes wide open once I realized I was in the devalue phase. I found that even though I knew I was being played with (future faking, intermittent reinforcement) I finally threw in the towel when I learned first hand that I had been triangulated, with a previous fwb, and most keenly, because it was made clear that the hang part of our meeting up, the talking, was something to be endured prior to getting what they came for. Npd sufferers seem to always tell you what you don't want to hear, but need to, albeit not intentionally.

Jesus, I'm so sorry; I cannot fathom the pain and anxiety you must have felt. What a smallminded and obscene desire to destroy….I wish for you that your nemesis could proceed to shed his layers of destruction and reveal his shamed, tiny self little by little, perhaps wearing a nappy and sucking on a dummy in his mouth….or maybe he could shrink a bit each day, Benjamin Button style, or even better ala Lily Tomlinson in the Incredible Shrinking Woman, a film from the 80s… I'm not being funny, but hope my odd reframing of the threat generates a something resembling a smile? You deserve happiness. I'm rooting for you and your family; tune and turn that ass-clown out! What a waste of humanity.

I do think it's worth remembering when dealing with someone displaying narcissistic traits that their subconscious “wizard behind the curtain"" may still be chasing after what they didn't receive when they were 5, 6, 7 etc. I don't know if it helps relations between oneself and the other person, sometimes I think, yes, and sometimes, nope, but I noticed that if I'm able to reframe their godawful, hurtful, antagonistic behaviours through a compassionate lens, this at least gives me a break from thinking about/climbing back aboard that broken-down, house of horrors, shitshow, ride without end, the “them!/it!/why?/when will they stop?/pls make them stop…/when will I stop expecting normal behaviour from them?” pain train continually running in my brain.
I am almost at acceptance for myself; but it's seeing the affects of this person's blindness about themselves, the damage it's doing to our children…I've never felt a pain like it.
(Sorry, I got a bit carried away there…pls let me know if my comment is a fauxpas, I'm new to contributing.)

Do narcissists sometimes speak to their girlfriends in baby language?
At the start of my relationship with my ex, he very quickly employed cutesy nicknames for me, the same that he used later for our children when they were babies, and beyond, almost in an ironic sense as they think of themselves as being “cool kids"", nearly “big kids"". I remember at the time the cutesy nicknames made me feel diminutive, feminine, coddled, and appreciated. I met him when I was picking myself up off the floor, after being repeatedly discarded and then hoovered by someone who I later realised displayed the characteristics of a covert narcissistic, who seemingly resented me for knowing my own mind, and being comfortable in my own skin. The nicknames became sinister when I realised that my ex routinely enfantalised me and habitually tore into all those qualities of mine he profe…

Thank you for sharing your own personal experience of connecting with your younger selves in different stages, and expressing how reparenting can lead to integration; I'd not thought about chronology before. I was wondering if you have any recommendations about how one can best go about doing this work? My usual approach in achieving positive change is something like this: start with research, lots and lots of reading, attempt to put new learning into practice, usually self-guided, and with limited success. I've read about and find appealing guided inner child hypnotherapy; is this considered effective?
A few hours after reading your post, I found myself pondering negative events from my childhood and wondering if any could be deemed injurious enough to impact me now, when suddenly a traumatic event from when I was 3 years old revealed its magnitude to me in a way it never has before…. yep, I reckon there's quite a bit to work with in just that one happening on its own. Had I not read your post, I don't think I would have registered how impactful this thing has been for me, subcnsciously…now I'm feeling like I really need someone to work with on this stuff, as I'm not sure what to do next…

This…
“But you know what, parent, the fact that we still try shows we truly don't understand, good. It's not a game I'd ever want to win, to win would be our death. So don't be mad at yourself because you are still normal and good and don't know the inner workings of the deviant mind …to truly know it would make us just like them. So be happy your still making mistakes handling them!”
Thank you for your post, and especially your statement above. I am on my case after each negative, awful exchange, for believing normal relations should still be possible, and that I have only myself to blame for expecting reasonable, respectful, and humane treatment from the one and only person on Earth with whom I chose to create new human beings.
I really am starting to feel like compassion is the key to getting past it, for both myself and for them, because as much as they cause me to suffer, I would never want to walk in their shoes nor feel the magnitude of their suffering, and to feel this way, I am grateful.

This might seem odd, but when you're in the middle of it and doubting yourself, wondering if you're being too xxxxx, try this…reverse the genders and see how you feel about his words and actions when you reframe your positions in the opposite sex: Guy has surgery and would like his girlfriend to be around to help him deal with the as yet unknown consequences, or pain management, food prep and moral support. (You may not actually want him in the bed with you, but you probably will want him nearby). But his girlfriend has other plans, she's planning a night out with the girls…so what if she sees them every weekend, he's gonna be just fine, all by himself, facing the unknown…he might need urgent medical treatment but you know, he has a cell phone…you'd at least expect the girlfriend to arrange a substitute stand-in, wouldn't you?
Now see if you feel like you're asking too much…
The only way to beat a narc at their game is not to play it. You deserve someone who is healthy in heart, mind and spirit.
Lastly, if you cannot say that you yourself are that, healthy, how about saying as sweetly as you can to those people who are getting in the way of your health that you care for them & wish them all the best, but can they now politely f-off and never come back.. this is your time, and you need it.
Instead, I would ask your friends/family to break up the weekend into shifts and be on hand for you. It's ok to ask for help, and most people feel good helping people that they care about.
I bet anyone who loves you will do this for you without hesitation.

I always try to keep this thought in mind, when butting up against what walks, thinks and quacks like a duck; they too, feel that they are the victim, just as much as I feel that I am, and that the pain they inflict is done so in self-defence. It's hard to muster compassion for a person so seemingly determined to destroy one, but it keeps me from giving in to their narrative, and from giving up.

This is the best explanation and guide for how to avoid narcs that I've read on quora; thank you.
I've been feeling stuck i.e. no longer trusting my judgement due to the sheer numbers of collected cluster-bs past and present, and somehow forgot that ultimately one can experience pernicious vapourous self-worth & yet still make choices in line with that of a person unencumbered by wound baggage; here's hoping fake it till you make it does the job…
(Am debating internally if I should give up my quest to find the smoking gun/a-ha moment/figure out how to be whole, i.e actually care about oneself without feeling cringe…the a-hole within still snipes and shies away from truly going for it in fear, but who cares? Everyone has one, after all. Or is there a key to authentic wellness that I lack? As far as I can tell, I'm just the latest output of dysfunctional families and their trauma, being punted from one century into the next. I have compassion for all of my ancestors, myself included, but how do I translate this into proper mojo?…sighs)

Thank you, finding your wonderfully written post was so serendipitous, for me, as I'm currently swimming against the tide and trying to keep my head above water. I've been trying to support one of my sons who claims his dad bullies him (which I've seen firsthand), and who's response has been to start a smear campaign against me with anyone who will listen, including the school, rather than engage with his son. It's quite exhausting and your post has really helped me regain the long-haul view, in that I stand by my intent and actions and am happy to let what I have done speak for itself. Thank you again.

Hi Victor, I just came across a few titles in Amazon regarding the vagus nerve, and wanted to ask you about the therapy you mentioned. Is this something one can do unaided, or does one need to find a practitioner? Is there a book that you'd recommend as a guide or intro to it? I have similar traits to those that you describe, I think. Not sure where to start, as it does seem a kind of whole being problem.
——
(I reread my post which follows, and though it was ‘fun' to write, my first on this site actually, it's not necessary for you Victor, or anyone to read, as posting my questions above doesn't beg for a why, but seeing as I've 'finished' writing it, I'm gonna go ahead and post it anyway…)
and, breathe…
About 2 years ago I started having fainting episodes known as vasovagal syncope, often in response to stress. If I had to come up with a narrative for why I started having these episodes when I did, I put it down to my body telling me that my usual approach to living life; aka running on fumes, well, it was done with that and I needed to change it up, as this bag of bones, sinew and skin wasn't gonna play that game no more.
Now I feel like I'm in a stairwell, trying to work out which floor I need to get to, and how many more flights up it is... And my ex, suspected-npd, he keeps shouting at me whenever I'm close to choosing the floor, confusing me with brain fog, despair, and invalidation, preventing me from building the life I want, rather than the one I found myself in. I started measuring in days how long it takes me to recover from one of his txt sessions (min 3 before I can sort of function normally).
I had hoped that our kids wouldn't become targets, at least not yet, but nope, that hope is toast. They're single digits still, in age, but both showing signs of the neverending story being etched upon their psyches, with one being rewarded and privileged for being the ex's mini-me and the other punished, harped on constantly, criticized, his self esteem in shreds, I think for calling it as he sees it… I really need to stop expecting different behaviour from this guy, as he's reliably loathsome, hypocritical and supercilious.
Sorry for my digression — I meant to circle back to ask William if he has any co-parenting w a narc tips, aside from parallel parenting…*sigh* …but if these fainting episodes could be signposts for actual changes that I can make, to make better relationship choices, for mental, emotional and physical health, I'm very interested. Hopefully there's a relationship between syncope and the therapy you mentioned.
As it is, at least I have learnt now how to tell these pesky NPD/sociopath types (that I attract and am attracted to) to go away and not come back; they seem to clam up and lose interest when I tell them that I need to put my house in order, to put my kids first, or work on myself, and as much as I want to give them more of my time, or other resources, doing so prevents me from taking care of who or what's important, i.e. not them.
I don't block my ex; I just have his contact set to mute.

I wouldn't be able to do it. Lol I'm Mexican and I just pull my friend aside and mention that I don't eat meat but appreciate the offer. I mention that I'd be happy to eat some sides or anything without pork, chicken or beef. I eat seafood but that's as far as I am able to eat anymore. If I don't eat something I'm not going to make myself sick trying to eat it and true friends would understand that.

This. I went to a Coco's, which had shutdown a few months after we went, and there was a long dark hair in my Alfredo toward the bottom of the bowl. I told the waiter and they called over their manager who said I probably put it in there because it was not hers or the waiters and the cook didn't have long hair. I had red hair at the time. I was already cranky and tired because I had gotten out of work and I also had just thrown up because seeing someone else's hair in the food I just ate half of made me super nauseous. We paid for our meal and were offered a slice of pie before we left because “their kitchen was closed and we can't make anymore food"". I just wanted to leave. I was already fighting off tears and a breakdown from stress at work and the situation. My husband felt so bad. Lol If they had just owned up to their mistake it wouldn't have been as bad but them calling me a liar when I clearly didn't shove a hair into the bottom of the dish on top of puking was the tip of the iceberg that day.

When I was younger, someone called CPS on my mom and she was told by the social workers that my brother and I needed to have separate rooms. We are a year apart and we were about 9 and 10. This was in California in the late 90s to early 2000s. I guess it all depends on the person who actually goes out and is checking on families.

I was debating on doing my own makeup for my wedding but a friend of mine made a great point he said, “you'll have enough to worry about that day let alone trying to get your makeup right yourself. “ My makeup was gifted by my amazing mother in law but it was worth it. I just had to sit there, try to relax from wedding day jitters and not worry about anything like why my wings aren't coming out straight. Lol Someone also did my hair. I know myself and how frustrated I get when I'm trying to do something perfect so it helped a lot.
All the women I've known in my lifetime have gotten their makeup done professionally.

I tip after they come usually in cash because our food has been stolen way too many times. I've had a woman driver answer my call when she completed my order and pretend she couldn't hear me when I was trying to ask where she was because we didn't get our food. I could hear myself echoing on her end over her speaker. She hung up on me and declined my calls after that. It was an expensive order so I guess her greed got the best of her.
If you don't accept my order, that's totally fine but I'm not tipping until after what I paid for gets to my house and in my hands.

I am worried this will be my brother. My brother has crippling anxiety. He is going to be 23 soon, he just quit his job of 6 years because of his anxiety, he has quit school 2 times, and now he’s on academic probation.
It’s been very hard for him, but it has always been really hard for my family, especially for my mother. I hope he can find his way in life because he can’t live with our parents forever.

See my neuroscience program isn’t like that. We never had to memorize pathways (except for Biochemistry class). i had to take a 4 credit neuroscience research methods class where we had preform PCR, western blots, cell splitting, cell staining, mouse brain slicing and staining, microscopy, etc. That class was the hardest class I have ever taken.
My curriculum is also missing coding. Although they introduce R in biology II lab and you practice with excel is statistics. But yeah, that’s It’s not enough.
I think that a lot of people do not know what studying neuroscience is really like because it’s so interdisciplinary. Definitely look deeply into the classes and program before applying.

I think that a lot of people do not know what studying neuroscience really is like because it’s so interdisciplinary. Definitely look deeply into the classes and program before applying.

Hi Kale it’s me. I’m going to be a senior in college soon! Crazy, right?
I was going to apply for a PhD in molecular neuroscience this fall, and well.. I realize that I absolutely hate bench work. I might look into more clinical/psychology side of neuroscience, but as right now I’m not pursuing a PhD nor do I have any desire to go to medical school.
Luckily, my parents are very supportive of this decision. I’m sorry that you’re parents are pushing you to keep pursuing a higher education. You’re so smart and young, Kale. Stick to your gut and have faith in yourself. And you know, I’m seeing some of my classmates go off to graduate school and I’m wondering if they will be fit for it or if they will be happy. The truth is, nobody really knows. I definitely don’t know where the future will take me! Also, you are so much more than your old researcher self. You’re a writer, disability advocate, a friend, a boyfriend, a cat father. Tap into those things. I feel like as STEM majors we are so focused on one identity but the world, and yourself, is so much bigger than that.that. Keep growing, keep trying new things, stick to what you feel is best, and time will help you figure it out.

I’m not trying to minimize your great actions, but I hate when people celebrate a police officers during officer when they do their job. It’s your job to investigate things that are dangerous. This shouldn’t be celebrated, it should be expected. You don’t see doctors on tv when they save people’s lives.

I’ve been following you for 4 or 5 years now, and I think I’ve mentioned before how you’re still one of the Quorans I still read about. I’ve honestly been really curious about what your plans are for after you graduate. I’m studying neuroscience now, I’m in my third year and I can’t believe you went through all that just to change what you want to do. It’s funny how life is and I can’t imagine how difficult that decision was, but I’m so happy that you’re doing something your more passionate about. Whoever you work for, whatever you doing, they are so lucky to have you!
Another funny thing is that I really looked up to you in high school, and I even had a dream that you mentored me. Like you, I think I’m drawn to neuroscience because it found me, and me; it gave me a purpose when I had none. Luckily though, I still enjoy it, and don’t see myself doing anything else. You were always so multifaceted though, and I knew that when you opened up your own business business/website (remember, was wasn’t it like tutoring at Hopkins or something?) and college prep?) Anyways, I’m so excited to follow you on your new journey!

Why does my female friend chat about extremely personal stuff (her breasts and other sexual stuff) despite having a boyfriend and also knowing that I have feelings for her (rejected me directly)?
She is selfish. And, in her way is cashing in on your attention. If you really want to see if she is truly “friend capable” ask her to not talk about things that she knows would trigger any man. anyone attracted to her. If she wants to be friends, respect would “respect”would be to share things you have in common. And if you have that kind of patience, see if she can understand. Its good for you to give her something to think about. Even if she gets defensive. She will think about what you had to say, and change her ways around you, or whatever. not.

What does it mean when someone tells you they love you in a dream?
I had a few dreams about the same guy id been in love with since the day i met him. But after a while one night after we got closer and closer i slept and dreamnt of being beside him in bed(where i was with him 3hrs earlier) and he told me he Loved me. I yearned to hear those words for years. The only dream i ever had with him saying it. I do believe it was a yearn, because id held onto the idea of him opening up to me for years.

I was abused sexually as a child by mother and her drug addict friends. I enjoyed and loved it. My father was mean and would beat me badly so whatever my mother had to give me I wanted it. The bad thing is my mind has ducked things up and now I have a deep hatred not for the ones who turned me out but those who knew and left me in the house they be tortured.

A little backstory about me. I’m a 45 year old man who has never been married. Im terrible with women and dating and relationships have never come easy to me and they never last. I’m always rejected. I am clearly a horrible human being if no woman wants to give me a chance at a relationship. But I’m trying to fix this and have been pouring lots of resources in. I got a big job promotion recently with a big raise and pouring more money and time into self help books and courses, therapy, and hiring a dating coach and a life coach and hiring a spiritual reiki coach and I’m calling the pastoral team to help me fix things just in case it’s simply just God hating me too much to help me get a girlfriend. I’m even pouring in lots of money to update my wardrobe and I’ve bought pheromone scented colognes and soaps and lotions and hygiene products which are supposed to alter my body chemistry to where it sends out chemical signals to nearby women telling them that I’m slightly more attractive than I actually am. I joined weight watchers and I get up at 4am to work out and have lost 60 pounds. I put off taking my own life to give all this a chance. But if it fails in a few years, I truly will know society is better off without me. After all, if no woman can fall in love with me and see me as husband and boyfriend material, then it means I’m a horrible human being with nothing to offer. Just look all the happy couples around and I see all kinds of guys who can walk up a woman and never get rejected. While I’m always rejected. I’ll be talking to my therapist and the pastoral team at my church before ending things. But before I take my life in a few years, how should I get my affairs in order before taking my own life? What advice can you give me?
This is a very heavy post! OK, first off, having a physical ailment doesn't mean that God, or anyone else, hates you; this includes palpitations at bedtime! You are investing in improving yourself thru therapy, self-help, dietary changes, exercise and spirituality. Adressing your health so holistically will improve your mood, appearance and life in general. These are all wonderful things! Make sure that you also do the activities you love. Fall in love with life, first. As for your nightly palpitations, there are many possibilities. You need to work with a general practitioner to determine if there is a physical cause for this malady. Your primary care practitioner (PCP) can help you by ordering initial tests, diagnostics and specialist referrals, like blood work, electrocardiograms and card…

People sometimes make mistakes. Regardless, this was not an “oops, I colored outside the lines” mistake. This was a series of poor choices that lead to you betraying a sacred vow in a heinous way. You need to be honest about your transgression, and take the consequences of your actions. If that means family counseling and doing everything necessary to rebuild trust with the husband you harmed, then you'll be lucky. More than likely, you've caused irreparable damage to your relationship.

I’m glad your nurse focused on the baby, and that you have a daughter who survived so healthily. I don’t believe this god complex is unique to male doctors. Most doctors do want to help as many as possible; unfortunately they become inured to the plight of humanity watching so many deaths and trying to focus on saving as many lives as possible amongst the stupidity and harshness of humankind.

Details: Both myself and my friend grew up very poor and homeless at times. We were incredibly close as teens, but parted ways in high school. She chose drugs and partying, I chose to enter the military and then pursued a career in healthcare. We came together again several years ago and have maintained a less-close relationship as adults.
I have tried to be helpful to her when my own finances allowed. I've supported her at times monetarily, and took her middle child under wing to provide several opportunities. I've never expected much in return, just friendship, and the hope that the little I could give might help her keep a job or build her confidence.
To be met with such an ugly statement hurts. I don't understand why she would gleefully wager on my potential suffering.

Gadget died at age 10 from lymphoma. He was incredibly sweet! Before his diagnosis he was the healthiest, most fit dog I’d ever had in my life, and had a very tolerant demeanor towards kids.
Unfortunately, he was one of a cluster of dogs in our neighborhood to develop lymphoma within months of eachother, something I and my neighbors attributed to years of round-up exposure. Nothing anyone could prove, but something we all suspected. He’s been gone for nearly 7 years, and I miss his antics regularly.

BPD= Borderline Personality Disorder. Though the two are frequently confused, they are distinct mental health diagnoses. One is considered a neurochemical imbalance (bipolar disorders), and the other is a collection of maladaptive personality traits developed as a combination of response to environmental pressures and hereditary baseline.

Depends on your age. As an adult, yeah. As a minor, not really, but it depends.

Would you marry a man that had previous sex with other men but will not admit it to you?
No, because if he can't be open and honest with me, or himself, then he's not ready for commitment.

Is a 4 inch penis in a 47 yr old rare?
Nope, that's average. In my experience, most men have around 4-5 inches.

I know that masturbation is natural and healthy, but I always end up feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself when I do it. What is wrong with me? Should I stop?
Sounds like you're doing it too often, and are not comfortable with yourself, or the act itself. There's nothing wrong with you, and you don't have to stop. Maybe you're going too far with it and need to take a break. It's okay to feel grossed out, just find out what you're comfortable with.

How do you know when it is absolutely necessary to speak up?
It happens often and not only when you were raised in an isolated or sheltered environment. Anyone can be faced with the dilemma of crippling fear when sharing point of views in front of a group or even one on one. Or a person may be habitual to acting on impulse and lashing out without an apparent reason. So, it is important to put into groups, situations, in which you must or mustn’t speak.
You must stay silent when:
a loved one is venting about their problems and may just need a listening ear.
an elder or senior (especially) is trying to convey some ‘golden words’
you are angry and may lash out at the nearest target.
Read here to know when is the appropriate time to speak and when is the time you must keep your cool.

What should I do? I am 34 years old, unemployed, single, I live with my old parents, I have social anxiety, I am afraid to go out. I have no money for medication and for the therapist. My English is not good to work online, no one is helping me.
First of all, Do not put yourself down and Do not compare yourself to others as that would break your confidence. 1. Upgrade your communication skill * Learn English and improve speaking skills as that would give you a competitive advantage and will land you a decent job as that's would make it easier for you to climb the corporate ladder. 2. Be Confident (if not fake it till you make it) * The technique to being confident is to try to recall any of your previous achievements that you have to endeavour, doesn't matter whether it's small or big. You have to be in that moment of achievement that you have achieved. As this would give you the “let's do it” kinda things and by this, you would be able to make the first impression as the best impression. 3. Try to make friends/meet more people * It's hard somet…

It is not the oppressed's responsibility to educate the oppressor. It is inappropriate and triggering to be asked to educate those whom hurt us.
However, I'll give you this: Our disdain for men is not a generalization based on one bad interaction. Our disdain (or more accurately, the need to protect ourselves) arises from years and years of perpetual and pervasive misogyny and interactions with men who feel they can dominate us. The effect is cumulative. You are a member of a population who has done a lot of damage and continues to oppress women. We would rather feel safe and live harmoniously with all of human-kind, but most of us have not had positive experiences with men (often starting with our fathers and brothers) and are now in self-preservation mode. No one is looking out for us. We have to do it for ourselves. Hell, we even have to fight misogyny within our own sex and gender!! Yes, many of us have become hypervigilant, but for numerous valid reasons.
So, rather than asking what is wrong with women/the oppressed, ask what is wrong with men/the oppressor and the society that breeds this corruption. You are not the victim here.

What should I do about my brother refusing to invite me to his wedding because I haven’t gotten the vaccine?
You should either get vaccinated so you can attend, or stay home.
What answer are you looking for here? Permission from strangers on the internet to breach your brothers trust and wishes by attending unvaccinated?

The only thing I would disagree with here is the overgeneralisation that chihuahuas and other small breeds are “never” suitable for families with kids. It’s just not true.

ok so I have been talking to my boyfriend for 5 months and we just started officially dating about two months ago. When we first started talking I was unsure if I wanted to be with him; however we would speak constantly. There were two instances before we started dating where we fought and he insulted me and blamed me for his bad actions. Eventually we began dating and since then he has not done anything bad or been mean to me. The other day I caught him looking through my messages him. I confronted him and he promised to never do that again and said he only did it be he wasn’t my number one best friend on Snapchat. My boyfriend also insists he sees me every single day and texts me all the time. He gets upset when I suggest that I sleep alone. He insists on driving me to class and picking me up (although I do appreciate not having to take the bus). He offers to pay for everything and buy me the world. I’m just not sure if this is normal or cause for worry.

What are the symptoms of anxiety?
When you overthink and it leads to inaction. That’s anxiety in its most basic form. Giving yourself time to think before doing is a good thing. But when overdone then it becomes a counterproductive, unhealthy mental habit that feeds your fears until you realize you don’t want to do it anymore. All of a sudden you’ve created ‘imaginary problems’ in your head which makes it more difficult for you to move forward. “What if they don’t like me? / But I’m so awkward / I might be terrible at it.” The antidote: Conscientiousness. “The mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.” (Robin Sharma) Discipline your mind. Do not let it work on its own. When you are aware of your own thoughts you can learn to stop overthinking at will. Like any mastery, it’ll take deliberate practice, but it is one of t…

So then why do people criticize Jews for being adamant about not allowing Palestinians to have equal voting rights? I'm sure they're afraid what happened to Lebanon will happen in Israel and it will eventually become Arab Muslim majority.
I live as a minority in the US and honestly speaking, I pray it stays secular as a Christian majority country even if I'm a South Asian Hindu minority. I don't want it to be Muslim majority in the very distant future or ever. If that happens, I feel the secular nature of the country will disappear.
I don't see Arab Muslim majority nations accommodating non-Muslim views on secularism or laws of the land. All Muslim majority countries, for the most part, try to be as Islamic as possible, so I wonder why Non-Muslim majority countries are so quick to accommodate sharia law and lose their secular nature.

Do some men hate feminism? If so, why?
The primary reason I know why feminism is hated by anti-feminists is that the anti-feminists feel that feminists are asking for special privileges for women. The special privileges feminists want for women are the rights men have enjoyed for centuries: access to work, property ownership, control of their own bodies, voting rights, wage equality… the list goes on, but it pretty much boils down to equality with men under the law. For anti-feminists, these equal rights are special rights. This is not the case for feminists.

Why do Indians returning from the US start talking with a fake American accent?
Well this is an interesting question. So, I grew up in the United States. My parents brought me over when I was 5, my accent is confused. I can speak Indian languages which I forgot for many years as a child, but I relearned them. I try to speak the language in the authentic, Indian accent. When I speak in English, my accent isn’t Indian because I didn’t grow up in India. I have noticed my cousins when they came to the US, initially used to wear sunglasses inside or act really strangely to show they’re Americanized or cool now. Try to speak English in an American accent which, I mean they still have an Indian accent so it still sounded Indian. Now, they've come down to earth and act normally and don’t try to fake an accent.

How come Indian Supermarkets like Patel Brothers and Apna Bazaar sell beef and other meat products when they have pooja items and murtis sold in there markets? At same point the workers who stock the beef and other meats could also stock pooja items.
Indians or South Asians aren't just Hindu, they come in all different religions and subcultures some of which don’t have any issues with beef and other meats. Sadly, Indians have no knowledge about other religions and subcultures of India.
When it comes to a business, religion and political views don’t decide what is sold or offered by the business. Plus, Patel Brothers doesn’t just cater to Indians, they also cater to Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are majority Muslims.

My very first bf. I was a teenager when we dated, I’m 29 now. He contacted while in town one day and I told him how I was going through a heartbreak. We met up to get my mind off it and talked about the old days. I began feeling sad again explaining my heartbreak.. He told me “Its his loss” ❤️

When I was 18 my ex was 28 the relationship was wonderful at first but I was so young I ended up outgrowing him i him. I broke things off after 1yr. Its not illegal but he's still got alot of growing up to do. If you want to settle down ,get married and have kids in the next 2–3 years he may not be ready for that.

Men have a greater need for sex than women do thats why. It's not our fault It' has always been this way. Men naturally chase women. Women are more picky when it comes to finding a partner.

I've been struggling with a similar issue. I love my fiance so much but im starting to realize I'm more attracted to women.
.I decided to stay with him because I do still love him weve been together for 9 years and I do have an attraction for him still. If you feel like you don't have any strong romantic feelings for him its better that you end it so that you can both find someone you can truly love

What attracts introverted men?
Introverts are attracted by things that do not interfere with their personality in any way. An introvert would be glad to spend time with less talkative person who does not disturb him/her with noise. So, socially introverts prefer nerds as friends. In a relationship, an intro would want to be associated with a person who is secretive, low profile and who likes indoor fun. Although introverts are not anxious in public settings, they have great tendency to make use of their own time without mingling with the external world. Such tendency may create boredom or loneliness and thus an introvert still would be willing to have a gf or bf whom he can spend quality time with.

Where I'm from, neither glass or alcohol are allowed on the beach. I think this “hack” is saying to switch out the Listerine and vodka, and give the vodka good coloring so it looks like Listerine — basically, it’s how to sneak alcohol onto the beach with minimal risk of getting caught.

This was all too interesting not to comment. INFJ here, just to specify. It really sounds like you’re just arguing about the logical fallacies of using specific cognitive functions while de-valuing others. Of course an INTP has a problem with an INFJ using Ni- INTP’s devalue it!
Let me compare this to a mathematics analogy (I’ve got a masters in pure math- and we’re talking about thought algorithms). To me, INTP’s thinking is kind of like a proof using induction, one step building to the next until the conclusion has been reached- like going up the stairs, one step at a time. That’s fantastic- very logical. If you wanted to prove 2 million was even, you could count up by 2’s until you reach it. QED- Fantastic. Or you could notice the pattern (Ni)- that it’s in the form of 2n. Much quicker way to reach a conclusion. In this analogy, the inductive proof (INTP) will most times be correct (yes- you’re human, you make mistakes too), but it takes forever, and they can’t even reach some conclusions. Finding the pattern will usually be correct, but of course the chance for constructing an erroneous pattern is higher. The trade-off being that INFJs can also reach conclusions more quickly, which has value in itself- especially for dealing with people in the present moment or theorizing ideas in general. INTP’s also need enough valid data to even reach their conclusions at all. Here I might compare INFJ’s to using a telescoping type proof to fix that problem. (It’s partially a judger vs perceiver preference difference too).
My long time best friend, whom I adore, is an INTP (female); the person that I spent the most time with this year is an INTP (male). I truly love how consistent you all are. But- your social skills lack! I’ve had to bail you guys out so many times. Inferior Fe, and polar Se- you’ve not got a strong a sense of the social aspects going on around you. You barely (if at all) notice when you are being offensive, so why would you notice when others are? An INFJ can hardly NOT notice it (Ni-Fe).
Plus, just because an INTJ says that they wanted to be mean to the kid because he looked like Joeffrey, doesn’t mean that the INFJ will devise their feelings the same way. It’s Fe-Ti axis vs Te-Fi axis. Decisions just aren’t made the same. You, who is on the same axis as the INFJ for decision making, didn’t mention feeling the desire to be mean to this kid- rather you liked him for what he did (being a hoot- Ti-Fe). This is because Fe-Ti axis makes decisions based on how the person is treating others (Fe) and that is basically aided by whatever subjective logic frame is built up in the person’s mind (Ti). INTJ was probably right about their own vendetta (Fi) showing up in their feelings about the kid. INTJ’s are endearing like that.
Also, the kid really may have been a jerk before that and you simply didn’t notice. Kid’s behaviors do 180’s so much (lots of great neuroplasticity). Also, some kids behave better for men, and some behave better for women. It’s a pattern that I’ve had many of my teacher friends tell me about- and noticed myself too. My money is on her having some information (probably picked up via Fe-Se) that you didn’t about the kid.
In sum, saying that INFJ’s are illogical just because they don’t use the same “Proof type” as you is a bit irresponsible. If I tried to only use inductive proofs, there would be a whole lot of things that I simply couldn’t do. Additionally, INTP’s subconsciously use a lot of Ni too (socionics). So your logic structures are built on your subjective thinking (Ti) and your subjective experiences (Si) with a swift undercurrent of subjective intuition (Ni) to boot. What I’m saying is, your logic is very subjective to your personal experiences- just as INFJ’s gut feelings are subjective to their own experiences. This really seems like the pot calling the kettle black. You really hate people going along with their gut feelings because you devalue Ni.
Every type has its thinking flaws, INTP’s are no different. To say that the “sore thumb” of an INFJ is a thinking flaw is kind of… it’s just your personal preference! Everyone has a thinking flaw! I think that you got the intent of the question incorrect too. Did you answer the question? Yes. Did you just answer it with a complaint that INTP’s have against anyone who doesn’t value Ti above all else? Yes.
On a side note, guess what type of mathematics problems that I had to assist INTP’s with? Ones involving patterns (Ni)! =)
Feel free to counter any of this. I wouldn’t mind clarifying certain points. I realize that I can sometimes jump from A to C, but skip mentioning B.

Why would someone who cheated on you, and after you left them, they found new awesome partner very soon (and they kinda liked comparing this new partner to you), contacts you occasionally even after a year, while still having this new relationship?
He's a narcissist, wants to keep you on a string so you'll be available if and when the new girl figures out he is evil. He feeds off your attention and the comparisons between you are a classic behavior. :(

Every pet I've ever had has slept in my bed, usually under the covers. Some of them even like to lay their heads on the pillow. Currently we have 3 small dogs and they are no exception. Nugget likes to burrow under they covers and snuggle alongside my back or belly. Millie likes to stay on top of the covers at the foot of the bed or up on a pillow between my husband and myself. Beau, the baby, sprawls on top of one or the other of our chests or heads even.. They keep us warm and derive comfort and security from being close to us. I would never have it any other way.

❤️ hang in …just keep holding on, hold on through the pain, even when it feels like it will never end, because it is a cycle, exactly as you said. I sometimes forget that myself. That's why it's so important to reach out to others wunderstand, like you are here. Because this life of manic highs and lows can at times cause us such deep anguish that we just want to get off the roller coaster. But, remember, it's all a wild ride and we are just a turn or a hill away from the next ecstatic joy. Even if it's brief moments, you will feel joy. Pain, after breaking us down, builds us up. It's just more dramatic for those of us who suffer depression. I'm holding on with you. ❤️❤️❤️

When Frontline plus stopped working for our dogs (after 15 years of excellent flea and tick control) we tried 4 other top spot treatments and ended up finding the most cost effective and almost total eradication of fleas with seresto collars. Purchased directly from authorized dealers only. There are a LOT of counterfeits out there and they can be dangerous.

What are some tips for keeping a journal of your therapy sessions?
That’s a great question and one that is such an individual process so take what I offer with a grain of salt. One thing to consider before taking notes may be asking yourself “what makes me want to journal in the first place?” So that you can get an idea of what structure and ideas you may have about the direction of journalling you’re headed in. For example, have you agreed with your therapist some exercise aims that might take a more structured, day-by-day journal shape, or if you are working more fluidly and often tap into the depths of your imagination, perhaps you’d try using a big blank journal where you can scribble notes and layer magazine images or colour drawings. If you’ve got an idea of what type of journal you’re drawn to, another question would be “what is holding or what would…

Why would someone stop therapy suddenly in the middle of their sessions without telling their therapist?
This strikes me as a question about what is unsaid between therapist and client. I’m imagining a client who regularly attends therapy and perhaps all’s going well on paper but one day towards the middle of their contracted relationship, they leave all of a sudden, no email, no voice message, nothing. Getting the obvious out of the way first; clients can face uncontrollable financial difficulties, physical or geographic circumstances etc. but I get the sense you’re wondering about what may cause a client to intentionally leave therapy. In that respect I’m drawn to the idea of rupture and repair in that particular therapy relationship. For example: * C: “A is bothering me because I feel B” * T: “Ok so A is bothering you because of X” * C: “No no… X has nothing to do with it, I feel B.” * T: “Well B might j…

Hi, thanks for the great post! It was incredible informative :) Just wondering, what city did you end up moving to in the UK?
My partner and I are actually living in London but looking to move due to the high crime rates here (and looking for more accessibility to greenery), so are weighing options to move to somewhere else in the the UK such as Edinburgh or Bristol with its supposed better quality of life.

For me, it's not emotional expression in itself that is off-putting. I agree that in a film, performance, piece of music, an authentic moment between friends or spouses, emotion can be deeply moving and even an INTP can get misty eyed, and have genuine empathy.
When people become irrationally or plain unhinged emotional, that's when I disconnect and want to run away and disengage. There's something about immature emotional expression like whining, dramatic flair for attention that comes off manipulative and disingenuous that is also really off-putting.
It's not that we run from emotions, or never feel any. I know I feel very intense/deeply but I'm definitely guarded with it. Showing emotion denotes vulnerability and I also get easily flustered when emotion is high. I don't like feeling out of control.

I enjoy these writing moments. You're hardly feeling as if you're “working” when you're in the flow and the characters have essentially hijacked you as their conduit to get themselves onto the page. Part of the occasional magic, in my humble opinion.

I believe that many of the comments here are very helpful. Probably much more so than what I'm about to say.
As a woman (and a writer of fiction, including some spicy works) I would only like to offer up this, perhaps it might be helpful: If you're writing from a female POV or just wanting to understand more about female perception, women are very sensitive to scent. In my own writing work, I personally draw a lot on the sense of smell and describe these things, also the tactile and even the sound/timbre/volume of a voice. They are aspects of “sexual attraction” that can be quite powerful. Though, I am a very sense oriented person in general. I can only write/speak from my experience.
Hope it can be a little useful, however, the other comments suggesting having a trusty female to assist, or a writer's circle is excellent.

What are the ghouls in Fallout?
They are human beings who were affected by high levels of radiation that mutated them into the crispy, husky-voiced characters we find in the game such as Hancock, Jason Bright, Bobbi No-Nose, Dean Domino and others. They achieve an almost immortality as ghouls exist from the Pre War Era and you will meet them in the various games. Their aging process is slowed significantly from the radiation mutations that occur. Ghouls typically kept settlements of their own and lived among one another in societies (Necropolis, Underworld) because all ghouls will eventually become feral but the rate at which that transformation occurs varies from Ghoul to Ghoul. Because of this eventuality, Ghouls will live among ferals and attempt to keep them from the rest of the wasteland population. Ghouls retain the…

What did Kellogg mean in Fallout 4 when he said ""I'm just a puppet like you""?
My personal interpretation is probably the most obvious; You’re both being manipulated by The Institute. He knows the truth about Shaun but at that point in the game, you do not. He was used by The Institute for at least, approx. 100 years and you were lead to him. It can be read as a warning.
Or, you can interpret it as a hint to the “Sole Survivor is a Synth” theory.
You be the judge.

Do you believe all addictions have the same root cause?
The short answer is No. I have met opiate addicts who had lived relatively “normal"", stable, well adjusted lives and due to some unforeseen incident such as a car accident, cancer diagnosis, physical injury, etc. were prescribed narcotics and after a time of taking them found themselves addicted. There IS a distinction between physical dependence and addiction however. But there can also be a crossover where one might have begun as physically dependent and then began acting out addiction behavior such as theft, secrecy, lying about intake, doing anything to access that substance, etc. . Then you have addicts who experienced abuse, trauma, chronic shame/neglect or were people who were by temperament or personality more curious and risk-taking or had impulse control issues and gravitated towar…

Kathryn Browning
If God loves us, why doesn’t he give us what we want?
This answer may seem a bit simplistic and vague, even but I always understood it this way: God expects us to depend and rely on him with love and trust that his Will for us is greater than we can understand in the moment. He does not hand out wishes, like a magic genie in a bottle or a fairy godmother. He wants us to learn, grow and seek him in all we do. That requires faith. Faith in God means surrendering our will for his. Whatever that may be, whether we understand or no.

Without context it is a little hard to advise. Are your errors with social interactions, is it work tasks or is it family? Do you have addictions or a medical condition that makes focusing difficult? Age is the normal way with dealing with things if you can learn from your mistakes.
Thank you very much for the reply. Sorry english isn’t my first language but I am trying my best to clarify. The errors that I made are usually in social interactions and doing simple activities.
In social interactions, I sometimes fail to understand a simple command. And overcomplicate a simple instruction. I am trying to think in a simple way but still it is so hard. Like when my dad asked me to do A+B, but I do A+F+I+Z instead..
When I solve math problems, I overcomplicate an easy math problem. Strangely, I solve the hard problem faster than the easy one. That is so ironic
And I also make other dumb mistakes like: dropping a tray, picking up wrong trolley in supermarket, drinking wrong coffee in Starbucks. I know it is embarassing. But when I made such mistakes, i felt as if my MIND was not connected to the REALITY. As a result, no matter how much I tried to focus and anticipated any possible mistake, I still ended up making the mistakes.

1984 is one of my favorite books ever. The best part in this book I think is the part from “The Book” which describes the politics behind the eternal wars and the society manipulation. It's easier to control people when they're ignorant and living in constant fear.
Also the speech of O'Brien is so important: Power is not a tool for making justice and progress like many people think. Power is a goal and one doesn't get power to give it away.
Finally, Orwell insisted on the importance of language. You cannot think straight with poor linguistic knowledge. You cannot talk about “Freedom” if there's no word as “Freedom” in the dictionary.
I guess there's more to learn from 1984 than what I've mentioned above.

Do you always unconsciously sit on the edge of the chair because your legs can’t fully rest on the floor?
As someone who is barely 5 foot (that is 150 cm for you intelligent people), I can surely say that I always sit on the edge of the chair when my legs can’t rest on the floor
Some exceptions is when there are ledge on the chair or table (I don’t know if this is the correct term, I mean the bar between chair or table legs to rest your feet upon), only then can I sit comfortably.

Can being a people pleaser make you a toxic person?
Definitely.
Imagine a people pleaser stuck in between two opposing sides. She will try her best to be diplomatic, avoid confrontation, and please both sides. When that is not possible, she will eventually resort to deception, or other negative things just to avoid being disliked by either side. If deception is not toxic then I don’t know what is.

Not every culture makes out death as the horrific tragedy. Some even celebrated it, which quite make sense since death is natural and will happen to everyone. For the Torajans in Indonesia,

What is the biggest misnomer of historical figures?
In Indonesian history, there are many famous historical figures, here are some of them:
Gajah Mada, directly translated, “Gajah” means “Elephant” in Indonesia. And no, our famous hero is not an Elephant.
Hayam Wuruk, which literally translates to “An Educated Chicken” (no, I am serious). Again, he is not a chicken, though I assume he must be well educated as a King.
Orang Kayo Hitam, he is just my favorite hero, how could you not love a “Rich Black Man”. This is not racist, this is just Indonesian history.
There are others, but these are some of my favorite historical figures misnomers which have puzzled me since elementary school. I don’t know about the biggest though.

How do you wish good morning to your lover?
I am Asian, so we don’t. Not really. What is even the point of saying good morning, to someone you love or not? More importantly, are there even such things as good mornings? If you are like me, you start your morning dreading your work and job for the day. Doesn’t matter that my house is filled with people I love, there is no such thing as a “good morning”. On that note, to answer your question, really a grunt or simple “hey” is enough to start the day, anything more will take too much of my energy.
People you love will love you anyway!

What is the first thing you will notice once you cut toxic people out of your life?
I felt like that weird, friendless, lonely kid. Because from my experience, those toxic people are everywhere and everyone. They can be the popular crowd or the not-so-popular crowd. I used to think only popular kids are mean, they talk about people behind their backs and made fun of them. But I have known some ugly and not popular people be as toxic as those popular kids, because they want to drag others down and make themselves look better. Those cliches about how the pretty women are dumb and the nerds are super kind? NOT TRUE AT ALL. If you cut toxic people out of your life, you will find that there is nowhere that you really belong, because everyone is at least a little bit toxic, even you yourself.

Why do some people have wanderlust and not others?
I suppose different kind of people will have different reasons for having wanderlust. For me personally, my wanderlust is a result from my urge to run away from my current situation. I feel as though currently all my family and friends and colleagues and the strangers have all become too familiar and too much. By being too familiar, I no longer feel excited about what is to come. I know who I will meet tomorrow or the next day, so what am I supposed to be excited about? Not to mention I kept being reminded of all the past mistakes that I made everyday due to the familiar surrounding. So yeah, I would like nothing more than to just pack my bags and go somewhere foreign and be anonymous. Some reasons why some people doesn’t have wanderlust might be because they are perfectly content with wher…

İn my opinion ,most folks live through survivalist point of view ,be it whether knowingly or unknowingly ,but for some minority ,they don't tolerate when the prospects of life getting lower and lower ,and at certain degree ,they can face every danger ,suicide to not fall below that point ,this way could lead them either termination of themselves or getting imprisoned ,tortured ,and this might be a cause or personal aim .

İt pains me to my core to see this post about Armenians ,why do you not mention the things system of a down did to our nation ,do you know the name of serj's child ,you get to nowhere by heavily and constantly humiliating us ,as is the seculars by humiliating Islamic religion ,Do you know the statue depicting Talat Pasha under the feet of his murderer ,that is found in Armenia ,what you constantly do is to cry ,being a cry baby ,and needs others to constantly feed you milk ,but alas you don't ever stop crying ,beware of Turks rage ,because when you continue fucking complaining all the time with everything ,Turks always pay the price .

At the least ,i could say personally that don't do drugs ,avoid medication ,maybe you need to question your being .being, i tell you this as a one medicated for so long ,(long enough to cover two decades) ,so what I advised is more precious than doctor's medication,in my thinking psychiatry is probably pseudoscience ,and when I delve into depths of reasoning ,i could easily say the so-called “doctors” are only the gatekeepers of capitalism ,at the end if you dare to question so-called “human civilization” ,you could see that all had been ,was ,is a “SCAM”.

I'm on the verge of taking my life. How can I say goodbye without hurting anyone?
Guys, life isn't for everyone. I've suffered for 3 years and now it's becoming unbearable. Why me ? I didn't choose to be like this. Telling me it'll be better won't help. You don't understand until you've gone through it. I'm tired of the sleepless nights and of the overwhelming thoughts. I just want to say goodbye without people feeling guilty and with questions unanswered. I don't want them to feel as bad as I do. Why me ? Why ? I just wish that you guys don't ever feel like this. There's so much for you to go forward. God bless you all.

How do you say ""relentless"" in Arabic?
I would say that it depends heavily on the context. The Online Cambridge Dictionary mentions the word قاس (Qaas)
In another place دَؤوب (daʼūb) is mentioned to signify never ending!

Yes, especially if he worked hard! I wish the grades we get in touch could reflect the level of success we get later in life but they really don’t. Perhaps his area of interests lie somewhere else. Just encourage him to keep trying hard and tell him that hard work is the only thing that truly matters.

It’s late night entertainment. It’s opinion…for the sake of entertainment. Does professionalism really apply?

Why does no one admire rigid parents?
Why doesn’t anyone want every single aspect of their lives during their childhood controlled and manipulated, leaving them an anxious mess for the rest of their lives?
Hmmm

Do you think a cockapoo is the best companion dog for people over 40 years of age?
Why the fixation on breed?
Consider adopting a dog, and focus on the temperament, not the breed. :)

Why are some people ashamed of their parents?
This answer is going to be a bit disjointed/emotional/to the point. I’m turning 30 this year. I was raised by my grandparents since the age of seven. I don’t call my mother mom, I refer to her by her name, because she was not my mother, my grandmother took on that role. I just got married last year and she wasn’t invited. I don’t regret this decision. I had to tell my family members to hide the fact that I’m getting married (which wasn’t too difficult, I’m the only child and there were only three family members of mine attending the wedding). Reasons behind this decision: I’m not comfortable around her, I have no relationship with her, she can’t control herself around alcohol and would surely make a fool of herself and ruin my wedding, she’s bizarre and childish, unable to hold an adult con…

thanks for your feedback! I actually wanted to point this out. I've had friends that said they recovered from a mental illness, but trying to remember what it was like before they felt better as they do right now seems blurry or foggy to them. I don't really ask a lot about it because I don't want to bother them, and maybe this could happen or could be seen as a coping mechanism like you said. In my case, I was diagnosed with depression and OCD two years ago, but I also can't recall what I've felt. When I talk with my mom about it and she asks me what was like having OCD and depression…I just don't know what to say, I get lost in my thoughts. I'm currently feeling better but sometimes I still feel like I used to before, OCD it's hard to control but I try. (btw, sorry I'm not a native English speaker:( my grammar can be a bit off) but thank you once again! :3

I have come to this conclusion as well. As far as not being into a relationship. I end up really hurting the people that I love or I end up hurting so bad that I can’t function. I believe that being alone is best for me. Not feeling alone, living in a happy solitude. Lol

I’m 52 and recently separated from a 27 year marriage. I had never lived alone. I moved into my own apartment. While I missed my home for a couple of months, I now come to my apartment and smile. I can not imagine sharing my space with anyone ever again. All that you say is true. Especially having the bed to yourself. Lol. Maybe someday I will look for another person to share my life with but right now it’s a big nope.

I have a 20 year old Asd son. He practically lives in his bedroom. He goes to work, comes home, goes to his bedroom. We have to pull conversation from him. I saw that you said that this type of behavior makes you happy. I struggle with accepting that my son is happy. He seems happy enough but I still worry. Please tell me, are you really truly happy with being alone and going to work? I just want my son to be happy and if this makes him happy, I’ll stop trying to force interaction with him or between him and others. Thank you.

This hits home for me. I’ve been estranged from my father for five years. He’s and alcoholic and uses crack. He has a violent temper and assaults people around him. I chose to cut ties with him. One day I had the oddest feelings. It took me about two weeks to realize that I was missing him. The way he used to be. The way he will never be again. When he used to sing to me and play jokes and laugh. He is still alive but he is so unsafe for my family and myself to be around. I dread the day he passes away because I know there will be guilt. Also some people give me a hard time and judge me for not taking care of him. He is homeless. Anyway thank you for writing this.

I dated a guy that would act out his dreams. Slap at the air, get up and throw furniture around, cuss himself out in the mirror. If I got his attention he would yell in my direction but look right through me. It was terrifying.

I absolutely know I'm depressed, but I don't want to get ""undepressed"" again. I don't get a sense in life, but also don't know why I should end it. Can I do anything about it?
I think it's called hopelessness. You don't really want to die but you can't think of a good reason to live either.

What are your top five suggestions for getting out of depression?
Get up . Get out of the house. Walk around the block. Sit at a coffe shop, be around people. Getting up and out is the hardest part but it helps so much.

What song has the lyrics, 'If I'm a danger to myself, just think what I could do to you'?

I don't know if I'm real; I don't know who I am. I can't feel anything. Is this world really real?
I am sorry about a few of the answers. ——————————— What you are feeling is completely normal. It is a side effect of anxiety. I know, the word anxiety is scary- but there is no need to fear. There is a word for what you are feeling. It is called depersonalisation or derealisation. They are words that describe a feeling of a more dreamlike world, one that is out of your hands. It may feel as if you are observing someone else’s actions that are not your own. Here is a link that will help you understand anxiety and depersonalisation more. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder There is a cure for this. It is called cognitive behavioral therapy.

Definitely show them the facial expressions of your suffering. It also helps if you're very interactive and affectionate (to their desired level, of course 😂). I have a beautiful 6 and a half month old male ginger tabby, and he's so beautifully sensitive and affectionate to my needs, very much a reciprocation of how I am and have been to him since I got him at 5 weeks - he even “protects” me when my partner is away 😭 he's my lil ginger angel-muffin😍❤️ best wishes to you with yours 🙏💗

I can see how you got there, but I think it's more of a “show me what you'd body likes and responds to so I can please you better”
Obviously some things will be the same as exes past but that's not to say that this husband will become kme like them to her or in her eyes, you know? Sex is a lot of repetition of the same kinda of actions if you think about it. Its the personal association I guess that would make it “like her exes”. I personally would argue maybe there's something deeper if the wife feels the need to express herself like so to her husband. To quote other lovers as better - what reason does that serve, I cannot imagine a world where that would be used to positively influence change in your partner though.

I strongly suggest a new therapist or breaking off the relationship — efforts to fix it yourselves haven't worked and professional help isn't working. Either your therapist is incompetent or trying to suck money out of you cause surely they'd be able to see a mile away if people aren't compatible and the like and it's their job to tell said people.

I think you are so amazing and empowering to both NT and autistics. Have you ever thought about going into counseling or starting some sort of advice/support program? Your level of introspection is comforting. I am the mom to an amazing son, who has so many amazing qualities. He is high functioning on the ASD. Unfortunately, he doesnt seem to see all the wonderfulness that I do. I can only imagine how hard this must be. I Very much try to let him be him, engage in his intrests, and support him. We are very close. He can have huge meltdowns and doesnt see the value in school. Hes a senior and it is everything I can do to get him through. This is the area we clash.
If you were to give advice to parents on how to best support their high functioning autistic child, what would you say?

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. You don't know how valuable they are to parents of children who are on the spectrum. My son is high functioning and Is so creative, out of the Box smart, hysterically funny And such a gift to this world. He doesnt see that or wont accept that. How do I help him to see these talents? I can tell him, but I'm just mom. I want him to believe in himself more. Do you have any suggestions on how to build that selfesteem. My heart hurts for him because I know hes going through so many extra issues that are not typical. Regulating his emotions and the way he reacts to things are very extreme and I know he knows that. Social skills and anxiety play a huge role. He can tell you how to handle situations but when they actually occur it leaves his brain. He has a therapist and an autisim itinerant. Is there anything that really helped you? You are so very articulate and really seem to understand your emotions. To me that seems like half the battle, trying to get him to explain why hes upset And how to take a pause when he is upset.Any advice would be great because the way you just explained things was so spot on. How do we let our children know just how wonderful they are and it's actually the rest the world thats not as fortunate as them. I am constantly reading to him about famous people in the world that have made Life changing inventions or ideas. Most of those people are on the autism spectrum. We need people on the autism spectrum to enhance our lives.!

I'm on the fence here. My mother didn't spend shit on us, do much for us, and mentally fucked us up. Lucky if we got government powdered milk and cornflakes. Stole tampons and clothes, etc for myself among other things. Yes she barely kept a roof over our heads but I can't recall if that was the whole time we were mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually(men in her life) abused. She deserves nothing if she ever found out my drug addicted sperm donors name and managed to get back pay..fuck that

Today, started out to be a completely normal day, except for the news which turned it into not so normal.
My husband stays awake all night because he is a PHD student and its very difficult for him to continue his work from home while the baby is awake.I mean, he still works during the day, but the efficency reduces greatly with the baby jumping and running all over the place, especially when he spot a laptop on his father’s lap and shout with all his might, OOOOON.
So today, after feeding my baby, I prepared his breakfast with smile plastered on my face. Its kind of my habbit since our marriage, I always prepare breakfast, before waking him up and he always thank for everying on the plate, even though the paratha(bread) doesn't even look like paratha. He said the same thing he has said zillion of times before.
Jaan, ap ny tou kamal kr dia. Ap bht achi hen.
Life or soul(referring to me), you have done wonders, you are so good.
And then he showed me an email from his professor which left me shocked or worried. He was moving somewhere else and can no longer support his new phd students anymore. He apologized and told my husband to keep it confidential from uni and to look somewhere else for phd.
I mean he left his job to pursue his dream of phd in ireland. Leaving me and my 8month old in home country. We were in the middle of applying our vissa. He left in sept 2019 and visited us in feb 2020 because he was missing our son so bad that he decided to take a flight to home country for just 3 days before the conference . Conference got cancelled because of covid-19 and he got stuck here because of lockdown. After lockdown he couldn't go because uni( trinity college dublin) in ireland was close and there was no point in going back there, as everything is shifted to an online system.
Back to square 1. Its 3:16am and he is sitting right beside me searching for new phd positions and i just can't seem to thank lord for blessing me with such an amazing man, who didn't complain neither to me nor to his professor. He congratulated his professor for his new position and told me for hundredth time
“hey, don't worry love. I will get a new scholarship within next 6 months, till then we have enough savings. Maybe it was for better, because this time you guys will go with me. I can't live a day without you and this little monster”.
I’m happy because I’m blessed beyond measure. I’m sad because i can't help him in this situation. I’m scared of, what if……I’m worried for the man who is standing strong for my sake but I’m in love with his calmness, politeness and belief that he will always be able to provide the best for his family.

Who told you that?. Get your facts straight. No muslim on the face of earth drink any form of animal waste, including this nonsense.
The best thing about islam is its clarity.
We are not allowed to drink wine because we have to pray 5 times a day( from the sunrise till the sunset). Wine is bound to make people lose control and no one can pray while they are drunk, hence bound to make mistakes during salah.

I was glad to see seizures mentioned as well; my flight or fight is so constantly in flight mode (I didn’t know this), any trigger can cause me to dead drop (faint, but not from lack of oxygen; just a straight drop to the floor), or worse, have a “seizure”.
My seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or PNES, look and feel like an epileptic grand mal/tonic-clonic, and a video EEG confirmed they’re not epileptic back in ‘17.
Glad to read about this.

I’ve been saying the same thing since 1994. I was a freshman in college, and will never forget that day. I have never believed it was a suicide; most people I knew who followed the band tended to agree. What I find most sad is that his death is remembered before his life. You hear ‘Kurt Cobain’, and most people think of his suicide before they remember what an amazing talent he was, how he shared his soul with his audience every night, how his lyrics could change a mood, a though, a life.
I never saw that note, thanks for sharing.

My daughter is 9, and has severe myopia for her age. She is -3.0 in her R and -4.25 in her L. We put her in contacts over the summer for convenience and to eliminate goggles for sports, and her only complaint is the occasional dry eye. Contacts may help slow myopic decline in certain pediatric patients, and her ophthalmologist was completely on board.
I should note that I am severely myopic, with astigmatisms in both eyes; I’m -9.0 in the R, -10.25 in my left, and have been in contacts since 4th grade (I’m 45). Admittedly, there have been times when we just can’t dial in a diopter/axis/base for my left eye, as it has changed over the years, and I’ve changed my desired outcome. I no longer strive for 20/20; I’m 40/60 at best, with my right eye being corrected for vision alone, while my left eye has always focused on the astigmatism first, then strength.
I have never felt disappointed, devastated, or upset about my vision…maybe a little envy when friends would get LASIK surgery and have perfect vision by the time they get home! (I’m not a candidate because I lack the corneal surface in both eyes, and refractive surgery is out of my budget and my comfort zone.)
Set an example for your child and embrace the uniqueness of wearing glasses. Don’t be their first “four-eyes” bully, please.

Um…I’d remove that .onion link, like, now. Most people reading this are not accessing Quora through Tor, and here on the clearnet, your referral code isn’t anonymous.
There’s a reason this information isn’t found in an A2A on Quora. Same reason why .onion links aren’t indexed by Google…OPSEC. And yours, my friend, needs to be revised.
OP, if you know what to search for, try Reddit. And if you’re using a browser that isn’t Tor, please anonymize yourself behind a VPN until you do. Just a little friendly advice.

Neither. “Finding those papers made her day” is correct for present tense; in this example, “have/has” is unnecessary, as “made” is your verb, used with an object (day).

If you do the exact opposite of what I did (change majors, skip classes, discover Everclear), then it’s not going to be easy.
Tackle college the right way, and you’ll do great. Or you’ll discover a different career path, and then do great then. Enjoy - BoilerUP!

Is there any case of dissociative identity disorder that you cannot remember the timeline of your childhood memory?
The abuse for me started when I was 2 and continued until I was 12. I don't remember much of my childhood at all. I'd say I remember maybe 25%. What I do remember are more like photographs in my head and not actual things I did. Just a picture or some vague smell that will trigger an image. Aside from that I don't remember any conversations except a few. My memories don't actually start until about 12 years old. But I do still have memory gaps when certain traumatic events have happened since then.

My first wish is that myself and everyone else in the world never has to deal with crippling mental health issues. Depression, ptsd, panic attacks, personality disorders, etc would all be knocked out without taking addictive medications.
My second wish would be to have my mom back so I could just talk to her, feel her hand holding mine, hear her voice, see her face one last time and be by her side as she passed. I didn't get to do that and it haunts me.

What has been your most memorable moment in the hospital?
When my second child was born there was a complication during her birth where she became stuck behind my pelvis. The nurse I had was an absolute dream before the pushing stage and afterwards. This nurse showed me and my family such compassion and love. I'll never forget her. I started my time with her after shift change. She was in her mid 40s and genuinely loved her job. At first her bubbly personality annoyed me while I was in pain, but I was never rude to her. She was too kind to be rude to! She stuck with me so much, always checking on me, providing me with as much assistance as I needed and she was just perfect. After the difficult delivery of my baby she came in to check on me shortly after. She stayed by my bed staring at my daughter and saying how proud she was of me for how I handle…

Perineum massage beginning 4 weeks prior to your due date can help.
Having your ob apply gentle pressure while pushing, having your OB use their fingers to gently stretch your vaginal opening while pushing.
Not pushing as hard and forcefully as possible. This allows for baby to stretch you down there instead of being shoved out.

What shocked you the most when giving birth?
A couple of things surprised me a bit.
First thing was that after your water breaks you continue to have gushes with each contraction. Nobody told me this and so I was pretty shocked when it happened with my first lol.
Second surprising thing to me was that I couldnt stop shaking after I received the epidural. I wasnt even abnormally cold, but I just couldnt control the shakes. Totally normal to experience that, but I didnt know to expect it.

Is it normal for a woman giving birth to ""tear"" down there?
I've had two babies and tore with both.
First baby was 6lbs 13oz and I needed 6 stitches.
Second baby was 9lbs 7oz and I had a 3rd degree tear that required internal and external stitches.
It's common for women to tear, but not every woman does. It depends on many factors and there are things you can do to minimize the chances of tearing.

Is pregnancy really that awful? Or is it just that one thing everyone lies about? As an anxious person, I am not sure pregnancy is the right thing for my future.
Everyone has different experiences with pregnancy and giving birth. It can be awful for some but for others it can be great. I feel like most women are honest about their experiences with pregnancy but you should keep in mind that it's so personal and doesnt mean your pregnancy would turn out the same way. My first pregnancy wasnt bad. It was pretty easy and I just dealt with the normal things like morning sickness and the uncomfortable parts like trying to figure out a comfortable sleeping position. My second pregnancy began pretty easily. I did have morning sickness for the first 4 months but after the baby began really growing I felt extremely uncomfortable. She was a large baby and took up lots of space in my stomach so naturally breathing and finding a comfortable position became tough. I…

What is something you wish people knew about pregnancy?
I wish that more people understood the discomforts of pregnancy. When a pregnant woman doesnt feel like going out, cleaning the entire house, cooking elaborate meals or what have you..it doesnt mean shes lazy.
Pregnancy comes easy for some but for others it's more difficult. My pregnancies have been difficult despite having no complications. Sometimes walking from one room to the next puts a lot of strain on my body. On top of that we go through things like months of insomnia, months of nausea and vomiting, not being able to breathe properly during the 3rd trimester and just feeling not quite like ourselves.

Has anyone had a bad experience with a therapist?
When I was 15 I was in therapy due to my issues with depression, self harm, and past trauma from sexual abuse. One of my biggest issues was my mother, which tied into all of the issues above. My mother suspected the abuse that I ensured from ages 2 till 12 and did nothing. She took me to therapy twice at 12 years old and took me out because she said I wasn't cooperating with the therapist. I was severely depressed and began self harming at 14. She only put me in therapy because my high school said in order for me to remain a student I had to see someone. Ok, so at 15 I was talking to my therapist about issues. My mother saw her alone before me for a couple minutes to explain to her that i was being difficult. When I opened up to my therapist she then told me my issues weren't my mom, but tha…

Thank you for saying this. I see so many people throwing around the word depression like it's nothing. Depression isnt just a bad day every once in a while.

Can panic attacks last for days? I have been having similar symptoms for four days and I went to the doctor and they said it was a panic attack but I have never heard of one lasting this long. It feels like my lungs aren’t inflating fully.
Short answer: yes, kind of.
More detailed answer: this happened to me after the birth of my second child. I was exhausted from lack of sleep and a hard labor. I had been home for a few weeks and was still recovering. I have panic disorder but hadn't had a panic attack since she was born. It hit me out of nowhere. Heart racing, cant catch my breath, face feeling numb, I'm dizzy, etc. I freak out thinking maybe I took too much medication by accident. I call my husband and enlist the help of my neighbor and am told to call 911. They come and check me and tell me its a panic attack. Ok, fine. Thinking it was just a huge one I try to rest. The symptoms of that attack lasted 3 days after that. It's not so much the panic attack, but the leftover symptoms and fear of it happening again.

Has a medical professional ever refused to treat you? What reason did they give?
My psychiatrist fired me for suicidal thoughts a few months ago. She claimed I was disrespectful to office staff, I wasnt.
She then said I needed more help than she could provide. I thought psychiatrists were supposed to treat things like that, guess I was wrong lol.

Do you lose your appetite while in labor?
I did birth the births of both of my babies. There is so much going on and pains from contractions that you simply just arent hungry.
I was in labor for 32 hrs with my first. Went about 48 hours without food. I wasnt hungry at the time, but I was starving after!
With my second I was in labor from about midnight and she was born at 530pm. It wasnt bad, but after her difficult delivery I was starving.

Why do some people put a kiss (x) at the end of everything they post or send? Does it make you uncomfortable?
Maybe they’re the kind of person who’s just so expressive and loving? They probably think it’s harmless and is a positive feeling to spread around.
If you feel uncomfortable about it, just be honest about it then. Everyone see and feel things differently. Work something out and you might be able to get a mutual agreement or balance point on this issue.
I personally don’t feel uncomfortable as I know some people use different emojis to express their meanings. However, do know how to differentiate when someone is being… sexual tho. :o You might want to avoid those haha.

I don’t really understand why a guy is starving hungry and eat a lot during the date is a problem haha. As long as the way he eat food is clean and polite, I don’t think it’s a problem. Unless he gives more focus to the food rather than talking to me haha.

Is having sympathy a sign of being weak and unmanly for a male?
No! People needs to stop genderizing emotions.
Male or Female, both are humans. Both can feel happiness, sadness, and pain. It doesn’t make you unmanly for feeling emotions; it makes you a HUMAN.
Stop reacting to people who tells you what a gender should act as. Instead, be what you want to be. Prioritize your own happiness and well being. We wouldn’t want to live our limited life just to get controlled and judge by others, would we?
Life is short, love yourself. No one can treat you better than yourself!

How much should a guy eat if he's going out with a girl for the first time to avoid looking like a pig?
Why fake your food intake in the beginning if she’ll know it after being with you for sometime later?
I don’t think the amount of food intake should be a problem. Just be yourself.
Oh, and make sure you eat politely and clean. Table manners should still be taken care of. Good-luck!

What are some wrong ways to approach a potential love interest?
Being too desperate (you’ll scare them off before you even got the chance to know what is their favourite colour)
Being too conservative (you’re not giving a chance for the both of you to have something to connect to)
Just be yourself. If it’s the right one, it’ll find its way to you.

Why do people get so upset at goodbyes?
Because they cared about the people who are leaving. And they care a lot.
Also, you’ll never know if that goodbye is the last one. Life is unpredictable, and humans are so fragile.
Just appreciate whoever in your life that cares for you.

If you were/are aware you’re hurting a person’s feelings, does an apology even cross your mind?
Everyone have a different level of EQ and mindset. You are going to get a lot of different answer for this question.
For me, I am most definitely going to apologise immediately. I’m one who couldn’t stand the fact that someone is hurting because of me. The guilt bag would be around me for a long time.
However, my partner is totally the opposite of me. If he thinks that the thing he said or action he did is right, he will not feel sorry; not even feeling apologetic.
Whether you hurt someone or you are the one who got hurt, you should be frank to your partner that you feel hurt or you should accept the fact that you hurt your partner. And from there, communicate and fix things. We all make mistakes here and there and fix them to get to somewhere. All the best.

What are the best student organizations or clubs to join at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman? Why should students join them?
The best club is the one you have passion for. There are a lot of Clubs and Society (C&S) in UTAR, but not all are that active. It’s obvious that the C&S that are active are filled with passion driven students. Their activities and events are heated and known to a lot of students. Regardless of which C&S students choose to join, in general, it’s a great platform to know more people outside of their own circle, extending their social network, meeting and exchanging different knowledges and experience with people. I personally would suggest students to try joining the Orientation Programme (in SL Campus) whether as a new student, or an existing student to act as a facilitator for the new student. It’s a great place to start. Consider it as level 1 in trying to achieve what I stated above. It’…

How do I convince a girl to do my makeup and who should I try to convince?
Just tell her that. She wouldn’t know if you don’t express what you want.
And if you already did but she refused, either you give her a good reason to, or you could just go and get some makeup yourself and put it on yourself. There’s a lot of YouTube tutorials about makeup for newbies.

What should you do if your father admitted you in an engineering college but you want to be a musician?
I’d first talk to my father about what I really want and plan in life (you do want to look like you’re actually thinking ahead for the future). If he reacted badly, I’d probably just go and complete my diploma/degree in Engineering. It doesn’t hurts to get a certificate I guess? But studying something you have no interest in is most likely going to be tough and such a suffering. However, what you studied for doesn’t determines what you’ll work as after getting that certificate. You could still be a musician. There are a lot of people who are a musician but came from a different background. It’s just a matter of how and will you go and reach out to your dream. It all comes to your priority at this point. Whether if you don’t want your father to disappointed; or you don’t want to give up your…

What strikes first time visitors as special or unusual when they arrive in Malang, Indonesia?
I’ve been living in this place for 3–4 year for education purpose.
As a student, I view this place has nice environment especially the weathers. It’s chilly almost all the time.
There are many variations of food too, hence it makes you won’t be bored to enjoy culinarily, and it’s CHEAP. so if you planned to continue your study here, it can be as one of the considerations you have.
People in here seem to be more open-minded since there are many visitors in here.
For recreation, there's a tons of choice, like Jatimpark, museum angkut, waterfall, etc.

If she told you those things, you should report her immediately. The whole point of therapy is to make you feel saved safe and accepted, if she doesn't you should find another. Hope you find one so you can feel better :)

Muslims are lagging behind because of their own doing despite all the benifits you poeple refuse to move forward stuck with your 1500 year old culture. For a community to move forward they have to accept certain practices need to be shed which you people don’t. hindus on the other hand have been open to change e.g gave up sati among other things. Muslims fight against everything that is done for the good of them.
you can come talk about hinduism when muslims accept uniform civil code.

Why didn’t you include any INDIA alliance members into “with little to no brains Or ability beyond Low Cunning needed for Politics” list? Rahul is a genius is he? or mamata? or Stalin all these are super geniuses I suppose. Because KB excludes them from his list.

What do nuns’ dress colors stand for?
As already mentioned the different Orders of (Christian) nuns have different colours (I don't know about nuns in other faiths). It is not uncommon to see Franciscans in brown or grey habits, Benedictines in black, Dominicans in white and black….there are several Orders in blue, even occasional Orders with pink or green habits.
Also, when a nun is in training (as a novice) she may wear a different coloured veil (white is common) or some variation on the full habit.
Sisters in Apostolic work (out in the community) may even be in ordinary Street clothes.
Hope that helps

Some breeds tend to use leaning more than others...Great Danes, Wolfhounds...the latter will only lean on someone they love and trust, and because they are heavy, big animals it may feel you you like a sting lean and to them just normal affection. You need to know your dog and his personality to discern his intentions, there is no one size fits all determination of behaviour. The Dogs Trust behavioural scientists have been doing some leading research and concluding that dominance issues in dogs are overplayed by most trainers and that dominance is only an issue for scared dogs, but in any pack is much more fluid from hour to hour, based on skill sets for the task in hand rather than a perceived hierarchy. It is very interesting reading. :-)

Thank you for your story ! I am so so so sorry you had to go through something like this that evidently caused you to suffer later on in life as well ! You did not deserve any of the horrible things that happened to you . Always remember that you are an amazing strong courageous person and what happened to you does not and will not ever define you ! I hope things get better for you ! You deserve nothing but the best in life !

What is the strangest test of bravery you have seen?
Sometimes engineers just have a total design fail: And you end up embarrassing people. Fortunately, her face is blurred out. Or maybe she enjoys the display. Who knows? But other times—designers were very deliberate…. Let me ask you a question. Are you brave? Would you be willing to use a toilet in a street window, in the busy part of a downtown city? Under the assumption that engineers designed it to be a one-way window: you see out, nobody sees in? Well, are you brave my child? In the words of JRR Tolkien, “Courage is found in unlikely places.”

Which actor played a villain role too well for comfort?
I'm 99% sure that Helena Bonham Carter is or knows what it's like to be mentally deranged. She is far too convincing in her roles, for my comfort. Which is why I think I love watching her movies. Not only does she appear whacked out in most of the films I've seen her in—with the exception of The King’s Speech and the new Cinderella movie—she seems to actually enjoy being whacked out a little too much. I mean, I can't think of anyone who could play Bellatrix Lestrange so well. She just fits the bill. She is the physical manifestation of pure, unadulterated anarchy. I am scared of it, taken aback by it, and in love with it, all at once.

Why didn't Lenin have children?
Infertility, probably. It happens. Lenin's wife was very beautiful in her youth (she is a blood relative of the actress Scarlett Johansen, and they are similar), but she suffered from a serious hormonal disease of the thyroid gland. Nadezhda Krupskaya in her youth, Lenin's wife, and her distant relative Scarlett Johansen.

Hi, i was looking for answers and came across an old post of yours i can only hope you're account is still active!
could u please give me advice? So I've been cleaning my hair light cool blonde for quite a while now, i did it at home a couple of weeks ago by bleaching my roots(im medium to dark brown) with bleach and 9% which gets me too very blonde, my length still has a caramel blonde to which i hated so near the end of my roots finishing i applied 6% with bleach and i always use olaplex 1 and 2. Anyways it turned out light blonde like a really light almost white blonde although i still has some uneven darker blondes to the lengths so i thought id try a semi permanent with 6% and it was meant to be a platinum cool blonde but found out it had violet in it.
i thought that would ok as to neutralise any slight yellow tinges or warmer tones…..put it on my roots first bearing in mind i have allot of grey around the front and sides (I'm 44) anyways it turned out lavender on my roots and greys, my lengths weren't as pigmented as them and it seems some lengths near the end didn't take, I'm devastated! My hair wasn't that bad before the toner :(
even though i use olaplex i still don't want to further damage my hair. I don't know what to do? I know yellow is the opposite of lavender but I'm scared to put yellow on incase it brings my blonde hair underneath to brassy yellow!
I'll attach a pic of now. I would really appreciate anyone s advice and sorry but I'm not going to a hair professional!

It’s so difficult. I know from experience, I know that this might sound rubbish and not very helpful but I feel that the only way to help or support is to stay open with communication, pray- alot and always have hope (speaking about the parents) stay supportive to addict but set boundaries. Sending you big hugs x

This is not what you want to hear but speaking from experience the only thing I can say is your family and friends should pray for you and keep communication open and honest as possible cos it sounds like you’re not ready or don’t even want to think about coming off, which is a shame as I know you’ll know you have much better things to live for and if your family and friends can talk to you about it there things you can have/do without drugs I guess that’sa start! I’m sorry if I sound pessimistic :/ when you want to come off for real you will feel it.i know it’s difficult I really do. Good luck to you and I wish you all the best x

I can understand this. Somehow I'm scarred today aft 41 years because of my mom's very loud sex life. We never talked about sex etc and when I'd walk in on them I'd be punished or frowned upon and it deeply confused me and disturbed me. I'm asexual and I always wonder if it was down to some of that or not.

What do people with borderline personality disorder wish others understood about the disorder?
I truly wish people understood that this is truly agonizing not just for the people around us ..(it agonizes me personally every second of the day )I have so many switches a day that I can’t cope or find a way to not breakdown every two hours or be disassociated sitting in the corner of my bed till my legs are numb ..
this disorder is not a kind visitor in My life
we are so worthy of love and of ourselves
I wish people knew that we are also trying to figure life out
I personally feel emotions burn at me in a harder degree and everything feels so scary and alone always

You’re welcome Therese. Therese your message makes me feel so sad … I’m glad you got pass somethings and having strength to push threw what you have been through. I really do appreciate you and you’re an inspiration and make me feel a bit confident in my situation.
I’ve been praying and I just pray for guidance knowing I’ve already done my part.
I found out he switch tax company and changed my current address to his to make it seem as if Im living with him and use our social security number to file taxes… knowing he haven’t been helping with the kids. He even got our stimulus payments since he filed as married jointly. I file a identity theft form and send it to IRS and let them know what’s going on, even let them know We have been separated from each other since 2017 and let them know he’s on child support but the people at child support couldn’t track him. It’s going on 6 months now and still haven’t received anything from IRS to take to court. I’ve been calling and they keep saying they didn’t receive my paper work and I would have to wait until 180 days. I was trying to wait for them to send me something in the mail so I can take that to court with me to show the judge what he has been doing … So that’s the thing. 🤷🏽‍♀️ But Thank you for prayers and prayers for you as well and may The Most High keeps blessing you and your love ones. Thank you again. 💖

Hi Therese
im sorry to know what happened to you and pray all is going well.
I want to ask how were you able to face him in court?
we have kids and marriage!
I try to put him on child support but they claim to not find him and it’s going on a 1 1/2 year now..:
im thinking I’m going threw trauma and don’t want to even face him at all… especially going through court! He’s a great liar and people believes his lies and I’m worried that the judge may fall for his lies… as well. I just want to be completely free by not being married to him. He don’t even care about our kids. Which is sad. smh

Thank you for your feedback! I am currently seeking professional help and have been for the last nine months. I initially went to my therapist for depression and anxiety and upon further reflection saw that I had more deeply rooted trauma issues than I realized. Unfortunately, she is not equipped to deal with trauma so I'll have to now search for another therapist. It is a blessing and a curse to see how broken I am but more of a blessing because I know and really want to get better. I am open and ready to get the help I need. Thanks again! Bless you too!

I haven't even finished reading your input and I already feel like this is one of the best analogies regarding sociopathy/narcissism I've ever read. I feel as though I possess alot of the traits of a narcissist as I've been torn for years between this inner battle of good and evil within myself. In my heart I feel intense love for those close to me. However, when I sense or feel as though I'm being rejected by them, I lash out to not just hurt them but I aim to verbally destroy and dismantle. Thank you for you comment. It brought a sense of clarity and insight to me regarding my issues.

I'm 24 years old & have been single all my life. To all ladies, have you felt lonely or with social pressure for relationships? How you managed it?
When you saw your friends , you affected from your friends , I can see this ! If you claim that you're career oriented , you should stop to worry about it... And you should go for your career , I think. You shouldn't give them that chance to block your career plans and you should achieve it ! It may be a bit hard. And maybe you're seeking for your real love , your “prince charming” but never forget this : LOVE HURTS. IN FACT , LOVE DOESN'T HURT , ITS CONDITIONS , ITS RESULTS HURTS.
And don't forget this , YOU'RE NOT AN OLD WOMAN! You can find a lover or husband finally but a career requires hard work and a huge time to achieve.

What should you do when you feel that you have no energy to do sth or anything in your life?
I can say that you should find a way to motivate yourself for living and being alive. It may be a reason to live or a goal. It is up to you. But not to have a living aim might cause depression or anything else. I am sorry if I did grammatical mistakes.

Do you miss Taehyung's bubbly personality? Be honest and please don't say that he's matured up and that we should leave him alone.
Yes. I miss it a lot.. I miss the carefree, innocent, always smiling him that when I watch old videos I cry.
I fell in love with that Taehyung. But every one changes, it's inevitable. I just wish he's always happy…

What is your unpopular opinion of NCT?
f. hey should let Chenle sing more. The boy has an amazing vocals such a waste. Heechan sometimes is too much. Idk if it's just me or nct is used to that but no hate his personality might be just like that. Over worked too, idk how where he gets energy. Mark could do good at other genre too. He hasn't even explore singing, I just wish to hear some from him. This boy is the best boy and he deserves rest. I think he really is still on his puberty, laughing at silly green jokes. I guess he's one of the most hard working and innocent idols(exclude the green stuff) 😂 Iw anted him to rest but I also miss him being with dream. Lol, mork lee. Ty, prolly the one of the least fave of mine in nct. Idk something about him is totally off. He a great leader tho, not perfect but good. Doyoung he's the best…

Idk why but being BTS Taehyung's sister is either a curse or a blessing (im not his sister omg) Any thoughts?
Well kinda, it's hard to have a brother like Tae. Many fans would probably harass you to get to your brother. You also need to think of your brother's reputation but that doesn't mean you can't be you.. I'm just saying it's hard with millions of girl wanting to know infos about your bro. But it doesn't mean it would feel like a curse having Tae as your bro, I think he's a very loving brother it's just that they didn't really grew up together that's maybe tge reason why they aren't that close too. Tae grew up with his grandparents while his siblings grew up with his parents abd of course he did left to train as an idol he has like little to no time to go home. I love the fact that only Taehyung didn't show a single pic of his siblings to protect them (atleast not officially). Everything depen…

As an INTP, I would break my heart even more just to move on,😂 translate everything first into logical way then trouble shoot problem just to be back on tract. I basically consider the guy dead.

Finally, someone that reads same as me. I've been their fan eversince 2014. I liked Taehyung since then, I knew he wasn't happy anymore and he looks like he wanted to leave but due to situations he can't. I remembered Jin saying they almost break up, he's probably one of those that wanted to leave.
He missed out so much in his family. His grandparents passing took a big impact on him since they basically raised him. He probably is a stranger to his siblings, he looks so sad when he told that he wasn't even called ‘oppa’ by her sister.
His very family oriented, I think he'll want to start his family soonest possible too.
When he leaves, I am sure hell would miss him. But I would rather see and think he's happy somewhere than see him sad and lonely. I love this guy soo much, he's the guy I liked the longest. I just want him to be happy.

This is true for me an Intp. I cut my hair shoulder length though because it's getting out of hand and I can't really show up to work not combing them. I would looked like a cavewoman 😂
But I sometimes do not comb my hair going to work 😂 I totally don't comb them when I'm just in the house.

Agreed. If you stan Taehyung long enough you'll see his ‘Done with everything but can't do anything about it’ its like he wanted to be normal person and not be famous again. Quite probably of how much idol life consumed his life, childhood and the times he could have spent with his family.
Hard times come hit him consecutively, stress from idol life, him loosing his grandparents who raised him, his friends.. He always regrets those for sure.
He never expected to blow this big, I bet.
I'm actually worried with him but thankfully he found Wooga Fam. Atleast he has his hyungs whenever he's stressed as BTS.

I agree with you. Lisa isn't the best female dancer in kpop. No hate tho, but she's not.
Eun woo kinda suffer and struggle because people only see him for his looks. He's a very talented man and he has a good personality to.
I kinda think it's hard being in a group with him because most people would only see him.

Well as an intp, it's hard to articulate ideas that you need to draw. Most of the times, i think of the ideas with weird image that kinda produce a huge map for the thought.
Also ideas come fast and most it's an idea after an idea that we forget how we come to that…
I'm having hard time explaining how we think 😂

As an Intp-t, my room would be small like there would be just a bed for sleeping and a blank wall that does not have a light entrance 😂
While other parts of the house would probably have a mini museum, a huge library/office that is sometimes tidy and most of the time chaotic but organized 😂
And a secret room where you put confidencial theories and evidence 😂
A receiving and dinning area where the only area guest would be allowed.
A garden, low maintenance plants 😂 preferably useful plants.
Ooh and also a bathroom with a tub and a television. 😂

What is the bitter truth about children?
Generally, Parents care children and expect their children to care them, at least emotionally, in their old age. Most of the parents even sacrifices many of their dreams and financial goals for the sake of their children’s future. Thus, Parents are very emotionally involved with children. However, in general, when those children become adult, they are less likely to be caring emotionally or otherwise to their parents. So, the bitter truth about children is: PARENTS IN THEIR OLD AGE, ARE MOSTLY GOING TO BE HURT BY THEIR CHILDREN. This is more true for the collectivist Asian Societies such as India and Nepal than Individualistic western societies.

I've been through this, if you are nursing and off medication it may be an idea to go formula so that you can start meds, I know it sounds clichéd to say give it time and I remember being where you are, but remember your bpd may make you feel OK one hour and awful the next, look into having a safety plan in place for when you are feeling in crisis, someone you can call, something you can touch to ground you, anything that pulls you through that moment, it probably feels like time is standing still, my little one is now 5 and my reason for staying alive… You will get through this, you are strong, you're a survivor, you've survived this illness so far, keep going xx

Well said, as someone with bpd I occasionally read things on here which nine times out of ten are just stereotyping and insulting. The intensity of each emotion is all consuming and I don't believe anyone would choose this life. Still such a stigma around bpd.

Should I forgive my girl? She cheated on me and lied. She didn’t even when I caught her. The reason for cheating was financial assistance and trying to choose between both of us.
No, if someone can’t decipher between two people, then they should not have a relationship with either. Financial issues come and go, that’s not an excuse for infidelity.

simply put, leave this toxicity of a “family” you’re not their servant you to have your own life, home, wants and needs. Leave them behind as a mere distant memory that soon shall be forgotten ever existed in your brain cells. You deserve better, they are taking advantage of your kindness, efforts, mind/feelings, and are attempting to brainwash you with their disgraceful behavior. Please love yourself, learn to forgive them and move on, life is short there shall be someone out there somewhere who prays for you, for your heart, your kind demeanor and that accepts you as a daughter in law that they treat just as their own and doesn’t put one above the other nor work you to your core. You’re perhaps young now, leave while you are not married bc this isn’t going to ever ever everrr get better hun’. 🤍🤍 I hope you find peace and tranquility in your life again. Life goes on and i’ll let you know now, no matter who he ends up marrying, they shall treat her the same most likely. Narcissistic behavior, overly codependent, disrespectful people use kind ppl bc they know they can sink their claws into them and latch on. You must break this soonest, turn back and never return before you end up having children who also will suffer in such pain and emptiness with you. This is not the family you belong in. You would not want this for someone, so why for yourself. Love is fleeting, respect is always.

Hi hun, love yourself first, after all things shall follow. This guy is feeding you attn, not love. Love grows.. it is not pushed and pressed upon. You’re overthinking, overcompensating, as well as indulging to much personal info.. guys aren’t ones to vent to, find a mirror and speak to yourself, find a girlfriend who is older and wiser. They will help you realize to seek honest, partnership/relationships in life and love. It also helps to get a cat/dog.. those are your best friends.. talk to them, they will truly love you for you. Also remember people are replaceable, life is so high strung for most folks and men have bigger and better things to think about then being in a relationship, especially older men. Listen to the other advices on this forum as well.

That's why most hospitals, hospice care, and long term care facilities are supposed to have visiting programs and pet programs (where certified companion animals come and visit bc lots of studies have proven the health benefits of just petting a calm, friendly animal).

Has a chiropractor ever accidentally killed their patient by adjusting or manipulating their cervical spine incorrectly?
To my knowledge there have been approximately 60,000 cases of strokes after cervical manipulation (the “neck-snapping”) in the last 20 years and many of those could have been prevented had simple ultrasounds of the carotid artery in the neck and other arteries in the upper body had been done. Ultrasound is one of the best tools a chiropractor can use followed by x-ray and EMG (measures muscular stress similar to an ECG for the heart) yet I've only seen these tools used in big sports physical therapy centres. This is one reason why I refuse to have my neck adjusted. I am even wary of having it massaged by someone else these days and only go to an extremely reputable sports centre if I feel like I need any kind of help with my joints and/or muscles. I will stretch and massage my own neck but…

Isn't it unhealthy to soak your hands in a bowl of acetone for 15 minutes in order to remove artificial nails?
YES!! You can cause permanent damage to your skin, not to mention absorbing that much acetone especially time and time again you can and probably will poison yourself. Your safest method is to use little pads which are presoaked in acetone (or other nail glue removal chemicals) and then wrapped individually so you get consistent amounts of the acetone for each nail. I personally don't wear artificial nails but a friend of mine who does uses those teensy tiny rubber bands that are usually used for very small braids to wrap the pads around the edges of your nails and hold them there. I've also seen one of her friends just open the top of the packet and slide the whole thing onto the end of her fingers and mold the packet with the pad on the the top onto/around the nail. This way you aren't l…

What happens to disabled people’s disability in their dreams?
I've been ill for most of my life now and I'm ill in my dreams. I'm unsure about my vision problems though. However, I'm always able to walk and even skate still (was competitive figureskater before illness) in my dreams. I've only been confined to wheelchair for about 10 years and in many ways I have not accepted it because the injury is fixable through surgery and for some reason my previous doctors never bothered to help me. I could still get the foot and ankle fixed but it's doubtful I will be able to really walk much. I guess I live out my hopes and wishes in my dreams.

Do nails grow even after death?
In a quick word? No. Here's why in a nutshell.
It only seems like they've grown because your skin eventually retracts away from the nail beds and loses its plumpness from around the rest of the finger.
There's alot that goes on after death but death is death. That means nothing is growing or changing. No cell division. Despite the rumour that your hair and nails are the dead parts of you, that's just not true, otherwise they would never grow at all.

Should I offer to push someone in a wheelchair if I see them on the street?
Short answer: NO!! You wouldn't tolerate some random stranger just touching you, would you? Or tolerate them moving you anywhere? Not without your permission, that's for sure! I have this issue Every. Single. Time. I go shopping or otherwise am out. My suggestion is to observe whether or not the person is struggling. Approach them directly so they see you coming and say: “You seem to be having a little difficulty. May I help?” if they consent, always ask if they're ready and how fast to go before you start to push. DO NOT breathe down their neck, talk for them to others or otherwise treat them as infants. We are smart, we are capable, we are fiercely independent. So, PLEASE! Do not get mad or upset with us if we decline. And remember that even abled-bodied people need help sometimes and it…

How can I stop my nail extensions from hurting?
Very easy and simple answer. Take proper care of your real nails and grow them out. We live in such an artificial world today and it's astonishing to the point of being ludicrous, even disgusting. Let me share a secret with you… most adults are truly turned off by all this artiface, especially when it comes to how one looks. The more natural one looks, the more likely they are to be truly happy, have the best self-confidence (not arrogance)and are all around healthier in body, mind and spirit than the rest of us. Pain means something is very wrong. If those artificial nails are hurting and you continue on wearing them, there's a possibility of doing irreparable damage to the nail beds and you could face the future having no nails whatsoever. (I got this info from a friend who teaches all asp…

Did your child ever beg for the spanking to stop? Im asking this because when I got spanked I was embarrased to beg or even cry
i have never spanked a child, but i was spanked myself. sometimes i begged for it to stop, sometimes i accepted it. it is natural for a child to beg for an abuser to stop abusing them. it is also natural for a child to freeze up in fear of humiliation or worse punishment. these are just natural responses to physical abuse, whether cognitively dissonant abusers want to admit it or not. science has proven it.

Did you ever get spanked as a child?
Yes. It taught me that violence was an acceptable reaction to behavior I didn't like. I recall even saying once to someone I hit that I was punishing and training them. I was a regrettably violent child. Once I realized that spanking was wrong I became far less violent.and less violent until I stopped ever responding with it.

try and feed him a high quality cat food for digestive care. little meals like chicken breast and brown rice occasionally are also good. make sure to give him a feeding schedule rather than free feeding him. there are over the counter medications specifically for cat vomiting, and i think it would work for acid reflux. dont try and give a human cures to him tho, even baking soda is poisonous to cats when ingested in moderate quantities. i would highly recommend going to the vet asap. they could really look into your cat and figure out the best diet for him, as well as give you some medication.
he sounds adorable, a lil old chubby dude

absolutely normal. Trust me, don't feel bad if you can helped it. been through it countless times and the good thing is that i respect if they don't wanna hang out! id rather have a tiny amount of friends who genuinely wanna hang with me than vice versa. if anything people leaving has taught me to be in control of myself and to give 0 f67ks

It’s something that people like us face in life from time to time. But you’re pretty young so trust me when I say, as you get older, people mature. Well most people. They’re still the people that never mature. But things really do get easier and peoples minds do change. I was bullied in middle school for having a secret girlfriend (she outed me). My parents were against it lgbtq. But guess what? I am 23. I don’t get bullied anymore. Most people don’t care about my orientation. And those who do care say they still love and care about me. And my parents? My dad and I joke all the time about me liking girls and my mom actually has a girlfriend now (my parents are divorced). People do change. I’ll leave you with this quote by Ellen Degeneres
“things will get easier, people’s minds will change, and you should be alive to see it”
stay strong!

Hey Zoe. I can see how devastating that can feel. I can almost relate to some of your story. But remember, how you feel right now is not permanent. Feelings fade. Things improve. I would recommend that you go see someone since you took pills. If you’re too afraid to say you took pills, then you could ask to see a doctor just for a check up. They’ll take your blood and make sure your organs and everything is functioning okay. Stay strong please.

Some people are known to faint at the sight of blood. Or even losing blood. The closest experience I had to this was the last time I cut, I started feeling very light headed, weak, and shaky. But I never passed out. It was scary because I felt like I would. So it’s not uncommon.

As a person with BPD, do you get along with other people with BPD?
I posting this question because I am diagnosed with BPD. But I’ve found that every time I make a friend with BPD they end up dramatically ending the friendship, push me away, or argue with me over something. In short, I never am friends with another borderline for long. Our personalities don’t mesh. Everything is great at first because we relate but then it just becomes a mess. So not to discriminate against my own disorder. They are awesome people. But I just choose not to pursue friendships with people with BPD anymore. Because I know where it’s headed and I’m tired of being burned.

Story of my life. Dealing with someone who promises to always stay and then eventually leaves us is an agonizing pain. It feels like a stab in the guts. And I’ve had to go through it so many times. I relate.

My landlord is evicting me because I'm 2 years late on rent. How do I tell him I'm not leaving no matter what?
You tell him just like that. How he reacts is up to him. I have rental property and if it where me, I'd wait for you to leave one day. Once you were gone I would get into the house and then instantly change the locks. I would immediately call some friends to come over and help me toss your shit into my truck, expensive things first and anything with your name on it would be taken away. I'd also have a lease drawn up with one of my friends names on it. You would eventually come back and find yourself locked out and us inside. You'd probably get upset and threaten to call the police (we would encourage that) and you would probably threaten to sue me for some kind of “illegal eviction"". I'd wait for the police to arrive and show them my mortgage paperwork and the new lease agreement I had. I would refuse to answer any other of the polices questions and keep telling them that it's a civil matter and that you could sue me if you wanted. They would eventually agree and they would tell you to take me to court but that you would have to leave the property for now. You wouldn't actually take me to court because you don't have any money. If by some chance you did happen to take me to court, and you still had time on your lease, I would just say you abandoned the property. You would say you didn't and the judge would ask you for rent receipts or other proof and you wouldn't have any and that would be that. Edit: So, there are lots of people who are saying that if I did this then I would be arrested on the spot and I’ll get sued and lose everything and don’t take my advice and on and on, so first lets address some things. 1) The original question was “How do I tell my landlord…” and my advice was to just tell them. That is the only advice I gave. The next was what I would do in this ridiculous situation, not advice for YOU. 2) For those that say “You would be instantly arrested” or whatever, I’d love to take credit for this idea, however it’s ALREADY BEEN DONE by a man named Flash Shelton and to the best of my knowledge he has not been to jail, prison, sued, etc and offers his services to others. Here is a link to the NY post story about him for anyone who would like to read. https://nypost.com/2023/08/11/handyman-flash-shelton-has-cracked-the-squatters-system/ 3) Like I said earlier, this whole thing is ridiculous to start with because after the first month of no rent payment I would give you a date to leave before I would file for an eviction hearing. If you made me evict you and then and you didn’t leave, the Sheriff would be notified, and they’d make you leave. However, if you came back and were somehow squatting, (Which is exactly what your doing) on my property like that, then we move on to the next level! You can like my answer and my methods or not, I don’t really care. You do you. At this point I’m tired of my email inbox getting flooded with “UP” votes and comments from every jail house lawyer so I will be turning comments and notifications off!

What do narcissists feel inside?
Hunger for things most can't comprehend. Not food nor water at time. To indulge in a chemical reaction within the mind. To sense the switch when something makes sense. They lie and act in ways to gain things they don't need or want. Impulses

I completely agree. It really hurts my heart when I think of the immeasurable amount pain his parents endured. I couldn’t look at my child’s dead body if they were decapitated-this means I also couldn’t hold them one last time and kiss them goodbye. I also hate to think how terrified Adam was and how bad he yearned for his mom and Dad when through his abduction-leading up to his death. Ugh, I’m getting emotional just thinking about it. There is no greater pain in life. NONE. I physically and emotionally couldn’t handle the pain. I would want to die without a doubt. I don’t know how his parents managed to move forward, even if they had another child to take care of. Poor sweet baby. He left this cruel, dark world and I hope his family feels his love from up above.

I disagree that after 25 rolls, your probability of rolling a double 6 is not becomes 50%. The odds would stay 1 out of 36 because you are never guaranteed to roll double 6. The odds stay 2.77777778% on ever roll. Or am I missing something 🤔

I would take the link out of your article to the racists’ website. Only to not send more traffic to their hatesite. I am all for free speech, but let those who purposely want to see the filth of the human(term used loosely) race figure out where to congregate.

Unfortunately even that is not true. Rape can be carried out even without a penis. Remember men(and I use that term loosely) are not the only whom rape.

When you spit in the urinal and there’s a string of saliva, do the bacteria have time to go inside your mouth?
Vibrio is one of the fastest bacteria around, if not the fastest. If you see live Vibrio under the microscope, they seem to zip around like Barry Allen navigating through Central city. Image from https://www.androidred.com/download-flash-wallpaper/barry-allen-flash-running/ So, how fast is this superhero speedster among bacteria? Estimates vary. This article pegs it at 75 micrometers per second. Another website gives a figure of 200 micrometers per second, and cites the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology as its reference (I could not verify this). I’m inclined to accept the lower estimate, as it is from a scientific, peer-reviewed journal. For an organism that's barely 2 micrometers in length, these are incredible speeds. It's like an average adult human running at 75 to 200 meters per second (270 - 720 km per hr or 168 - 447 miles per hr). So, how quickly can this organism traverse through a string of saliva bridging your mouth and the urinal? Let's assume that the length of the salivary bridge is about 50 cm. That seems like a reasonable estimate, considering the average height of the adult male and the placement of the average urinal. I’m not being sexist here. I just think that it is logical to assume that urinals are mostly used by people who pee standing up. Image from https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/six-weeks-jail-man-who-filmed-10-men-using-urinal 50 cm = 500000 micrometers. That’s a loooong bridge! (Public domain image from pxhere.com) Time taken for traversing 500000 micrometres when moving at 200 micrometers per second = 500000/200 = 2500 seconds. That’s close to 42 minutes. Hah! I knew Douglas Adams was onto something! 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything! If we go by the more realistic estimate of bacterial speed (75 microns per second), this increases to 111 minutes. So, if a bacterium is to travel from a urinal to your mouth on a bridge of salivary mucus, then all of the following criteria have to be satisfied: 1. The urinal should be harbouring Vibrio. 2. The top speed of this bacterium is assumed to be 200 micrometers per second. 3. This bacterium must be moving upwards continuously at top speed. 4. You should stand still for about 42 minutes. 5. The salivary bridge should remain stable for this time period. So, to answer your question… …does the bacteria have time to go inside your mouth? No. References 1. Shigematsu, Mika, et al. ""The measurement of swimming velocity of Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the video tracking method."" Microbiology and immunology 39.10 (1995): 741-744. 2. https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/ElaineKung.shtml

Absolutely glad my comment hit home for you. I meant every word. Addiction is no fucking joke (apologies for the language) and I don't think most people can appreciate the struggle. I can tell you, your story did lift their spirits and at just the right time. I could tell they were struggling much more with the anxiety of withdrawals. Your story helped refocus them on what they are working towards so THANK YOU for sharing it. Take care and big props once again!

You hang in there brotha. I know 2 people currently detoxing off coke and Xanax and their struggle is real. I can tell you I will share your story with them as I know it will give them renewed hope and knowledge that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I can only offer a sincere “Damn proud of you"" and I know it might not mean much from a stranger but I believe it is something you should be constantly reminded of. What you accomplished is something worth pride. Anytime you feel your strength faltering, I hope you reread your own story and find strength in knowing the battle your have been winning and pride once again. What you did IS WORTH IT!

How can I punish my 13-year-old son for kissing a girl of the same age?
Why would you want to punish him? I think I had my first kiss around 13(well REAL kiss) and it was nothing more than a wonderful childhood memory. I still remember her name too, Misty was her name lol In all seriousness, is there something that you are leaving out because I think most of us do not see anything wrong with your situation. Maybe it is time to talk about sex with him if you haven't already. He is growing up and whether you like it or not he will continue growing and will want to do more and more with the opposite sex (or same sex, which is his choice and ok also) demonizing sexual interactions with the opposite sex will (or same)will only do irreparable damage to him and could cause resentment and rebellion to which you will only kick yourself in the ass wishing you had just been a mature and progressive parent when you caught and punished him for kissing a girl of his same age.

it occurred 2 years ago, as I got older I started to realize how disgusting and wrong it was. The adult lives in another state and I have their contact information and everything.

Is an average person capable of doing great things and if they do, then are they still average?
Being average is a choice to me & it depends on the persons perspective on life!
You can be a millionaire & still be average, my opinion! Below average citizens are capable of doing great things!! If people love one more & cared for one another no one would be average!!

How many of you had a very tough time while raising kids alone but, still you haven’t gave up?
It means you’re human & we all endured some type of hardship in life!
No matter the financial status, race, religion or geographical location you may be from!
Being a parent is an everyday learning experience, especially in this generation today we live in! It’s ok to raise kids alone!
It’s also a choice!
Know you’re worth
Seek spiritual guidance
Talk with your children about their feelings on you dating again or rekindle an old flame w/ dad if it’s not a toxic relationship!
Love yourself & Trust God!
In time all wounds heal!

What are some examples of equality in America?
In America there is no such thing unless:
equality comes when the rich sit with the poor and the sick, there is strength in numbers & also in love!! We are to love one another as Christ loves us!!

I don't care travelling again to Europe after being denied a student visa to Germany and Canada. I successfully set up a small business and comfortably earn at least a thousand to two thousand euros a month and manage a vacation trip once a year to beautiful places like Zanzibar, Seychelles and Mauritius. That's given me a better life in Central Africa. So who cares about living abroad again 🤷🏽‍♂️ I just need to concentrate on my business and make more clever investments.

At least the men usually come out clean that they got a kid out of their matrimonial home. In an off an on relationship that lady had no reason to lie to her husband.
She should've even used it as a way to get out of a relationship with him permanently.
What the man did is beyond disgusting. In fact if he didn't kill himself I think he deserves the electric chair plus guillotine all in one.
But my question is how do we as humans learn from such a tragic story?

What happened to speaking the truth ? Let's use this story to learn from mistakes of others as humans.
Sinc they were seeing other people in an off and on relationship. It's pretty easy to tell the man. “Look, these kids ain't your kids”. She shouldn't have let it get to that stage of doing paternity tests. From the story it's not like they were married. And even if they were, she definitely slept and conceived with a different man(men) during their break ups. Before coming back in to the man's house just let him know. “This pregnancy I'm carrying ain't yours”. Truth saves lives we must learn.

How much do pet owners love their pets?
I have a cat….let's just say she has me very well trained. I make sure she has what she needs before I have my needs. My first radon for this is because I live her. She is my child (I have no children).
The next reason is because she never asked to live with me. I chose her to live with me. I would not feel that it is right to put myself before her due to this.
When you get a pet I feel that it comes with responsibilities. If I did not want these responsibilities I should not have taken her into my home and life.
Above all thoughI love her like she is a member of my family so of courseI place her needs first.

Not all former addicts have had a bad childhood. I have been sober fir 3 1/2 years and my childhood was wonderful. I was the kid that decided to make the choices I made and I now have to live with those choices. My life would not have turned out the same any other way. My choices made me who I am today!! I made some mistakes, but who doesn't?! Not everyone that decides to try drugs becomes a horrible person and yes I can live a normal life now. Why? Because I choose to!! Anyone can do anything they want if they put their mind heart and soul into it. Life isn't easy for all of us so we are the ones who ultimately make it what it is.

Perhaps people underestimate how much of committment marriage and when people go through a 'tough patch’ want to divorce, an easy option. I think some people have an unrealistic notion of marriage as being easy, like anything in life it needs working at. I also think we now live in a society whereby everyone compares and measures their lives against others, much of much is done via (anti) social media. When the grass seems greener on the other side, it's normally because there is more manure there. Comparison is the thief of joy

I agree. I know of very educated people with poor people skills, and general lack of awareness of other people emotions etc. I think IQ tests are biased towards certain gender and race, also psychologists have also failed to agree as to how you define IQ. If you can’t agree as to what it is, how can you measure it?

If Americans are not obsessed with guns, then why has every president who has suggested a change in legislation failed to do so? They realise that if they propose it whilst in office, they would not serve a second term, or if it is part of their presidential manifesto they will not get elected in the first place.

What should we do if our daughter wants to change her last name because she doesn't want anything that reminds her of us?
I changed my last name at a very young age because of three reasons:
The history of the name is quite bad and it actually seems it comes with a curse. People with my previous last name tend to be extremely unlucky and end up with tragic endings.
I never felt like a whole person with my previous last name. I had no identity before I could choose my own.
My new last name is very international and can pretty much be pronounced the same way in every language, which is very important to me as I'm bilingual.
I felt like a brand new person and I've not looked back in 11 years. I wouldn't be so pissy about your daughter wanting to find her own identity.

Have ghosts ever visited you in your dreams? Do you know any stories of ghosts visiting people in their dreams?
My grandfather passed away back in 2008 after many decades of suffering from MS. He wasn't able to walk or lift his arms, and he had to be fed, changed, and helped with absolutely everything. He was a prisoner in his own body. We didn't have a very good bond, as we were living in different countries, but I knew from mom’s stories, that he was a wild card back in the day.
One year later I’m off at college and one night I have a strange dream. I was in this white-ish room waiting for something and suddenly I see him, my grandfather, walking towards me. His hair was longer and his beard had grown longer. He was all dressed up in jeans and a denim jacket. And like I said, he was walking. I'd never seen him do that. And not to forget the most important thing; he looked happy, and so free.

It’s none of my business but my daughter gets this way when she’s on antidepressants. I’m not sure if you are taking them. It took a long time to find something that works for her. Like I said to her Antidepressants can only bring you so far. Doing shadow work digging deep within yourself is what I found to help. If I may suggest I would look into a holistic counselor. You could be deficient in vitamins or minerals. I wish there was a magic pill but there isn’t and at the end of the day we have to do the work. I’m sure deep down you do care but it seems to me your tiered of the daily grind. The struggle is real. If there’s anything I can do to help let me know.

My dog is covered in ticks and won't let us remove them. We're strictly quarantined (at a risk of getting shot at) so we can't take her to the vet either. What should I do?
I’m not a veterinarian. But my vet tells me to give my dogs Benadryl before I bring them for their shots to help relax them. Maybe this will help enough for you to get them out.

Need some advice
So me (m) 27 and this man (m) 26 I'm seeing asked me out to dinner tonight earlier this Morning. Let me clarify. He went MIA yesterday after I texted a response to him asking me about my day and I asked him the same. His excuse for the late reply later that morning was his family was in town for Disneyland. I let him know beforehand (yesterday) I have some work to finish but will finish in time for the evening and be free today. I try to compromise with him and I told him we can meet where he wants to. We confirm later this morning. He texts saying he's having dinner with friend right now and we can have dinner tomorrow. I told him to enjoy I will just go out with friends and pass on the Sunday dinner. I feel disrespected for some reason.
What should I do?
TL;DR I'm ghosted night before by someone I'm dating, texted and was asked out for dinner; he reschedules and tells me he's at dinner with a friend.

I've been born and brought up in Dubai. I'm an Indian by nationality.
Your experience of Dubai depends on which part of Dubai you spent more time in. You should have considered seeing Jumeirah (exorbitantly expensive but beautiful), Bur Dubai, Karama, Oud Metha, Deira. This place is definitely very expensive, especially for tourists because you don't know where to get the best deals from. But, the locals and most people out here are very warm and welcoming. In fact, south Asians hold a 40% population out here so it is very rarely that you will actually face racism.
Even though I don't have nationality of UAE, still I feel more at home here than in my own home country, ie. India.

What I do wonder is, how does the health care logistics and population acceptance scale between large and diverse nations such as US and China versus smaller countries like New Zealand and South Korea? As with most data, without scale, comparisons can be very biased.
Not to discredit good results but Taiwan is the size of a province or state in a larger nation while Hong Kong is a single city. The control possible over population that size must be different than for the control required for a very large nation. Similar analogy would be global sized corporate versus family business in terms of the complexity of system management.

The poster went to HK as a guest and a visitor and yet experienced what the West would define as “racism” based on the language she spoke. By your logic placed onto her scenario, then a HKer who’s unable to speak French happens to go through a French International airport that can’t speak English then the French passengers have no reason to “accept” this visitor in politeness and the ground crew is ok to judge this HK passenger based on the fact that they don’t speak French?
Generalizing and attacking whole group of people based on the behaviour of few or even many is just wrong, even if there are justified political causes behind it.

What is wrong with you, rate yourself and stop caring what others think about your look. It’s whether or not you are a decent person and what your value base is…when you die do you think people will say…well she was a 10 out of 10….no! They will think about what you did as a person and the legacy you leave behind

Really, you value yourself so little that you need validation from others to prove you are worthy. Work on loving yourself no matter what people think about your look. Way more things going on the world that are worth focus than your hair or body

Yes, lovely eyes however your make up is making you look older than your years. I think you would look lovely with Smokey eyes in grey or browns/copper. It would take years off you and make you look soft and seductive. Just my opinion, regardless you look great!

What can someone do to make life with a narcissist better?
Depends on circumstances, if it’s a partner I would say leave, if it’s a family member it would all be about damage limitation ie adopt the gray rock method, limit time spent, have other distractions, understand it’s only for a limited period of time etc
Not sure why you would want to stay with a SO who treated you in not a respectful manner. Ultimately it’s your decision, your life, you should lead it the way you feel fit.

Is it good to be evil? Being evil usually has an immediate pay off whereas being good or nice doesn't.
Doing evil feels good in the moment and trust me, costs you later and costs more than you gained from doing evil.

Whats even funnier is that these blacks will get the worst of every woman and then turn around and call themselves kings. I guess these kings have low standards which explains why they WUZ kangs, and not currently kings, because their tribes got enslaved by bigger better kings which is why they were sold to the Americas and the rest of the world. They wus kangs until real kings sold their black asses and turned them into commodities.

Does this mean that the blacks should be dethroned anywhere that is not Africa? So no blacks allowed in political office in America, Europe or anywhere else that is not Africa? They need to remember they were slaves sold to Europeans by fellow Africans, not natives.

I also want to add that all these “affordable housing packages” just have the opposite effect. Legislators across the country all make the same mistake of forgetting to think about the landlords when it comes to affordability. The think they can just make more laws to force landlords to provide better housing. Problem is we'll just adjust, and be more conservative next time. That means no sob stories, higher rents and less forgiveness. The longer governments think were a charity, the more were going to show them we're not.

Unfortunately he did abandon her and took his children after a couple of years. I guess back then mental health support was virtually non existent in the UK. Her husband didn’t understand and perhaps could be accused of abandoning her but dealing with a dysfunctional relationship and the consequential effects on their children put too much of a strain on the family. I think their leaving exasperated her condition. That said she also lost a lot if friends too. I also think her sons commitment of visiting and trying to support her kept her alive if only barely. So sad but with an ultimate good ending if only for a while.

Totally agree with you. There are always nay sayers to everything, especially those who don’t experience mental health issues and cannot understand what it feels like. Grant you, there are many individuals who have had issues and haven’t received the correct support. It takes time to find the right treatments and there has to be the resources available. That being said in comparison to ten years ago it is getting much better with the media supporting awareness campaigns. I’m so glad you got the right support when you needed it :)

Have you ever seen someone who looked completely dead inside?
Completely dead doesn’t describe my best friends mother in law. When my BF went into hospital to have her first child I met her mother in law just after the birth. Her son had brought her to the hospital hoping to spark some happiness into this poor woman who was a shell, perhaps seeing her first grandson would spark something in her? She sat in a chair not talking to anyone and starring at empty space, she had to be prompted to make basic interactions and movements. After spending about an hour in the same room she made no effort to communicate or interact with anyone in the room. I could see deep sadness in this tiny frail bird like woman, she looked seriously empty and the lack of interaction made the happy event on this wonderful occasion deeply unsettling.

I think they wanted both of us to be there when they delivered the blow. They asked me to have somone with me when they delivered the news and I chose my husband. As we were admitted overnight and his flight was due in at 6am I agreed to wait but was assured he was safe for the moment. I could have demanded an answer but knew that his white blood count was elevated to an incredible level so guessed where the conversation was headed. I spent the next 12 hours just watching him sleep through transfusion after transfusion. I think I may have been afraid of the answer and took the time just to watch my incredible little boy sleep and stay in that peaceful place for as long as possible. I could have kicked off and demanded a general MD diagnosis but wanted to hear from the specialists.

What symptoms did you notice before being diagnosed with cancer?
This answer is for my sons symptoms. He was four and just started primary school. In typical British winter weather he caught bug after bug, sniffles and usual school shared viruses. Then his skin colour appeared odd like a slightly tinged green waxen effect. My husband worked abroad at the time so I tried to take photos so I could explain the odd colour he looked but my limited knowledge of cameras just couldn't capture the effect I could see. The next morning I took him to see the GP and was told he had winter skin and just needed sunlight exposure. If it continued after a vitamin boost I was to come back after two weeks. An iron boost did the trick and his skin appeared normal again. After two days the sheen appeared again and I took him back where a blood test was done to check his imm…

Something similar recently happened to my daughter. She was hired by Halloween City for the holiday season as a sales clerk. The toilet overflowed and flooded the stall area with disgusting water. The manager wanted her to fix the toilet and clean the bathroom. There was no plunger or mop. Nor was this in her job description.
My daughter suggested that they call a plumber and they refused. She quit and walked out. Glad to hear that you stood up for yourself too!

That's disgusting, illegal, and insulting to those of us who are lisenced professionals. If that's what you are looking for, get yourself together however you need to…wash your hair, loose some weight, be a respectable member of society, out from behind your computer, find a significant other and do it in the privacy of your own home. ***SEXUAL FAVORS ARE NOT PART OF ANY PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE*** STOP FREAKING ASKING!!!

You don’t! massage therapists do not get turned on to you, they have a job to do and that is what they are thinking about. Do not ask for any sexual favors, much less, beg, it is insulting, unethical and illeagal. There are no more legal massuses or parlors. massage therapists are educated and believe that there are theraputic bennifits to massage, we are not there for you to “turn on” If you can’t get a girl of your own, get a prostitute who is ok working illeagally and performing sexual acts.

You absolutly need to have a license to practice massage therapy legally, and if you want it done right without the risk of injury, go to a licensed therapist. It’s insulting to actual massage therapists when people act like just anyone can give a massage, we are educated, know proper techniques and how to use them safely. I make a decent wage without doing sexual favors and anyone can do that. Happy endings may have been a thing done at one time, by a massuse in a parlor. A licensed massage theripist is a different thing entirely. If an LMT chooses to give happy endings, It is illeagal and unethical and they can lose your lisence for it, I worked hard for that license and would not risk loosing it forever, along with my self respect, just so some dude can get off. I know some therapists and people claiming to be therapists do it, but those of us who have self respect and value what we do are tired of being disrespected. If you are looking for happy ending, get a prostitute, massage is different. If a licensed therapist offers it to you, and they think they are above the law, have no self respect or respect for their colleagues, have fun, just know it is illeagal and not the norm. By no means, ever, ask a LMT to give you a happy ending.

I also had an I also had an adult woman neighbor so mad at me because her husband hit on me, I did nothing including I didn't tell her and maybe I should have, who knows. She knocked on my door so hard she dented it and open my screen door and held it open with her backside to talk to me. I ended up shutting the door in her face, I opened it up again because my son was actually trying to sleep from his graveyard shift, at this time I told her she better find something else to do this discussion is over and she spit in my face. and you bet I called the cops they told me I shouldn't press charges because I would have to live next to her and we should try to be civil to each other. And I said well that's not working anyway so yes I press charges. You don't go to somebody's house and spit in their face no matter what's going on. Her marital problems were not my problems. He was very flirtatious and had other women over all the time. it sounds so childish as I'm typing this out, but people do need to be responsible for their actions this wasn't the first time I had issues with her coming in yelling at me when I was getting out of my car and things like that I grew up in a small farm town when I go home to see my parents people still wave at each other oh, I didn't even know stuff like this existed in the world and I made the mistake when I moved into town I thinking that Neighbors we're like they were in my small town and then I found out the truth the hard way. we are moving in two weeks and I'm going to keep my distance this time oh, for real be friendly but don't get close and hope I don't have any little tyrants like you have running around

Perfect advice!! I have beefing with neighbors, but this is unacceptable. I hate to say it because people always want to blame iton bad parenting, but my kids never would have done that. I did however, once time have the neighbor kids say that my kid broke their window. They left their kids home alone all of the time. My son was playing in the front yard kicking a ball around with them, but there is no way that this type of ball could have broken a window and when you looked at the damage, the glass clearly was broken from the outside. I did blow her off. Maybe i am crazy thinking my kids wouldn't have ever done something like that, but they are grown now and never got into any trouble. You have video proof, these kids need consequences for their actions and if they don't learn a lesson from this, they will go on to do worse things. Neighbor problems suck, but you already have them so i think, you them in.

Tell her to stop being depressed? I might piss off alot of people here, but if your teenage daughter comes to you with something like this, you listen God Dammit!! Or would you rather her bundle it up inside until you find her hanging in the garage once day like my friend did? Both of my boys have suffered with anxiety and depression both and I don't know if either of them would be alive today had I not listened and got them the help that they needed. It's the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with being a mother, it hurts and it's hard and you can hardly make it through your own workday because you are so worried about them. I guess I could have told them to just stop feeling that way so that I could go on with my life and not be worried sick all of the time, but that's not something I know how to do as a mother. My God, she came to you, is your job to listen!! Even if she isn't clinically depressed she needs you for something and I am sorry for being harsh, but I have seen this question on here before and it absolutely infuriates me!! You either shut up and listen to that girl or get her to someone who can! This isn't about you, or how to get her to stop, it's about you getting what you need you and you not feeling like taking the time to really listen to her from your heart. In my opinion, as a mother, it should already be within your heart.

I had no idea this was a thing either!! As it turns out this is totally me too!! I used to have this rule about it, when i was young, like when i first became sexually active. I just flat out wasn't going to do it with someone i was not in love with. I also went to a very small school and even without Facebook, it was like someone announced it over an intercom right after it happened, everybody always knew!! I would just tell them whenever things got close that i didn't do that with someone i was not in love with, I actually had a6 month rule too for awhile. The guys that were looking for one thing didn't stick around and i had long meaningful relationships. I honestly really think that the reason i didn't want to just have casual sex with someone is because i knew that it would absolutely crush me. It just meant more to me than that and i knew if i gave myself up to someone that i would want more and it would leave me devastated. The only guy i ever just slept with before i was actually ""in love” was the 4th guy i had ever been with, i had really strong feelings and i turned him down twice first, i do think i slept with him because i was trying to keep him, but once I did it, I was sure that it was over. The truth is that at this time in my life i had one friend in the world, it was a guy that i worked with and everyone thought that we were dating, I remember talking to him about it and he told me (since everyone at work would soon find out) to just act like it didn't matter to me. Like it was just casual, no big deal, and it was just so weird to me to think of it that way. I was already a broken mess. My family was mad at me because i moved in with my boyfriend that they decided not to like anymore after 2 years with this guy, and my very best friend that i had known since preschool, slept with my boyfriend!! So when i say that i really only had one friend, is the truth. As it turned out, my first casual sex experience turned into many nights, and many days spent together and i have been married to him for 22 years!! And thank God!! Because i really did like him and at that particular time, if all he wanted from me was a one night stand, it probably could have crushed me beyond repair!! Well that ended up being quite long. I think that we empaths are surprised by this, it was quite interesting to think about. Thanks for reading if you made it this far! Bless you all empaths……

How does smoking addiction start and how do I know if I am addicted?
I personally am addicted to smoking marijuana, I do at least 5–6 times a day sometimes more or less but when I’m running out of weed I get anxiety. If it consumes your thoughts and u can’t think of anything else and feel tense and just not yourself until you smoke… your addicted. It may take a while for u to realize, it took me a year to admit it to myself.

It’s probably cause your burning the weed. I use a bong and I smoke daily and I normally never have problems I don’t even cough but the only times I’ve vomited or died coughing is when I keep the lighter on the weed for too long. It just needs to touch it for a second and when you inhale the rest will get lit.

I had my therapist say something similar with similar meaning behind it. I feel like she notices when I start to shut down when we talk and start to get angry… most of that is geared towards her whom I view as sort of a mother figure. Hence the reminder that she is safe and cares (unlike my own mother did with me).

This response as unsettling as it is …was so helpful. Reading it has caused me rethink my dismissed foggy memories of my abuse. It reframes some it as more real than they’ve even been. That’s a little hard to deal with honestly. There’s a little bit of safety to not having some of my abuse be real… though it prevents me from moving forward in my healing journey.

As a client with an eating disorder I’ve eaten with my therapist before and I found it helpful. However, a therapist eating a blown meal without therapeutic value is just awkward.

Your response is so relatable to my relationship with my own therapist. Thank you. That said, I’m moving from feeling like I need reassurance from her all the time to being able to reassure myself most of the time. I’m guessing that was her intention by not always rushing in with a response when I felt like I needed her too. I’ll have to talk to about it now.

I’m so sorry this happened…. It resonated a lot with me. A lot of my husband behaviors with my kids and myself concern me. Whenever I bring my concerns up he gets defensive and ask me why everything is his fault. I’ve ask him to consider going to therapy and his go to response is “I’m not ready”. Meanwhile, our marriage is suffering and so are our kids.It’s been so difficult that I’ve slept on the couch for three years now.

I cringed reading this question. I get needing beliefs to be challenged in therapy… but pushing to talk about trauma? Doesn’t that end up sometimes re-traumatizing clients? Maybe it’s just me. Also, bring in client lead therapy myself… I can’t imagine my therapist bringing up my traumatic experiences and feeling safe. Even when my beliefs being are challenged , my therapist is well aware that sometimes I don’t react well and she’ll slow down. Therapist aren’t mind readers either. That said, it takes some mad skills to adjust to a client’s needs ,expectations and maintain good boundaries.

I see my therapist every Sunday since we go to the same church. She won’t acknowledge me unless I say hi first. We never have conversations though. It used to be a little unsettling , but now I’m okay with it. I hope she is too.

Christina, I’m going through something similar with my husband right now. He has some major anger issues that have landed him in community service. He recently got in such a rage with my son I had to tell him to take a walk before he got physical with him. As he was leaving , he yelled that I blame him for everything. I imagine my previous ultimatums have felt like blame. I have an appointment with a lawyer on Monday.

My therapist said to me “that’s f’d up” or something to that effect. She doesn’t normally cuss which made it really funny and the fact that she’s also a pastor made it even funnier. She’s definitely a keeper!

What are some ways to help a college student with social anxiety?
There will be answers like: workout, meditate, eat healthily, etc. But I’ve tried all of them, and none seem to treat my SAD. I have posted a month ago that you can get rid of SAD by sheer will-power. However, as time passes by, I am not quite sure about the validity of my statements back then. Workout and other healthy option do ease the feeling a little bit, but not for the entire day. After a workout, for example, your mind calms down and you’re able to somewhat make it through a couple of hours without the anxiety overwhelming you. But it is not for real interaction with strangers and crowded places. I still am struggling with the idea, about whether I am able to overcome my Social Anxiety with will-power alone. I encourage you to first try making a healthy habit of workout out, eating h…

If you have willpower, is it easy to beat social anxiety?
In my experience with SAD, yes you can. SAD is an extreme fear of being embarrassed or judged by others. The fear comes whenever you’re about to do something that involves the interaction with another human being. The beginning is in your head. Before you even take a step outside, you’ve already created the entire scenario of the social anxiety in your imagination. Your heart beats faster, you get the shakes, and before you know it, you’ve already put down your keys and changed your clothes and never want go out of your house. This happened to me the day I decided I wanted to change my gym. The gym I used to go to closed because of financial issues, and partly because no one goes there, hence why it was the perfect place for my anxiety to not jump around. I think hundreds of times about this…

How do I make my kids feel loved when we have no family involved in our lives? I graduated high school online, so I dont really have any friends. In the last 5 years my aunt, mom, and now sister have died. I feel so alone in life anymore.
Watched a documentary once where folks either didn’t have key family members OR didn’t like the ones they already had. Their need was so great they enlisted help of “matchmaking service” for lack of a better word. This organization arranged meetings and helped facilitate the process to know each other before deciding to commit to these important relationships. You would have to watch the documentary to appreciate the brilliance and sensibility of such a unique way to gain love and connection. I have strongly considered this option myself.

Do you think there's a correlation between narcissistic family abuse and being an avoidant as an adult? I'm usually terrified to check my bank balances, open letters, read difficult emails until the very last minute. Is there a cure for this?
YES, you are 100% correct. I have all those issues as well as those listed by the other responder. I am also the family scapegoat. I’ve always been aware something is off but only recently do I now understand how serious this type of abuse actually is. Our lives would have been much smoother and actually fulfilling being born into a healthy family. Every day has felt daunting just showing up to my own life and feeling unloved by your family is indescribably painful

That you had forethought and on-site to include surviving dog. I just recently went through this and did not for a second think about bringing the other dog in. I was too wrapped up in my own grief. I wish I had thought of that so thank you for sharing that story and I’ll get it right next time. My surviving golden doodle acts very depressed even though he always seemed so indifferent to the doodle I just lost. I guess that’s why I didn’t never occurred to me that he would be so affected because they didn’t seem close, although they were together 24 seven for 10 years

Should my friendship with this person with depression be over?
Having suffered my entire life, your question begs another. Why would you ask such a thing?? My criteria for accepting / rejecting friendship is based on character and integrity AND not if they are not well. I would like to understand your point of view. I certainly know the experience of losing friends because I can’t always show up 100% myself. It is painful because it’s not a choice of something else we would rather do. It’s no different than when you are sick and limited by everythingsick

How do I tell my estranged son that I have moved on, have a new family, and it is better that we do not meet again? He is 25 and I have not seen him for 15 years.
you really set yourself up for 100% pushback. It is encoded in our DNA to bond and love our parents. Why so many of you don’t feel that way towards your children is impossible to understand. trust me I have problems with both my parents not giving a shit and it just cost me a lifetime of unnecessary pain and setback; it’s in your psyche and there’s not a whole lot you can do about it, believe me I have tried my entire life to fix these things and always believing I was the only one at fault. The other fundamental issue is that as humans our greatest need is to be accepted while our biggest fear is being rejected. Coping with this level of hurt leaves you in the down 1 position but I hope he’ll get a handle on it somehow, shake that shit off and have a good life in spite of this powerful ps…

I had a nervous breakdown and accidentally told a family member that I was severely depressed. I regret it immensely, though I had little control over it. What should I do?
First off mental health is as important as our physical health. I would start there when speaking to family. Calmly and confidently inform them but first check the words you use. How do you know you had a nervous breakdown and severely depressed - both require professional diagnosis (such as it is). I learned the hard way to better serve myself take the dramatic language out and just use facts you have evidence of. This gives you a fighting chance family will show understanding and compassion. You don’t want the very painful dismissal when they either can’t understand or won’t. It is shocking how heartless “friends” / family can be. On the other hand their ignorant myopic thinking is not cause for us to have shame or be shamed by such idiots.

When I was in my teens, my exposure to Black peoples was entirely on TV. I grew up loving the Huxtables, A Different World, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire.
These upper class fantasy shows are heartwarming and entertaining.
In my 20s, I found myself living at a Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Facility. With many many Black and Brown and White women who had been taken down by drugs and alcohol, the Equal Opportunity Destroyer.
I learned what life was like for women of color there and, later, at the University level with CRT.
I’m heartbroken that the new BIPOC feminists disregard all the work white feminists have done over decades. They drove me out of the movement.
The movement has devolved into pussy hats, pointless singing, and the dismissal of human life as no big deal and nobody else’s business.
I don’t know my party anymore. We deserve to lose to Trump in November.

White privilege is bestowed upon me by society. How am I supposed to control how society views me?
In areas of America, being white comes with privileges and advantages. Other times, it puts a target on my back. There’s no real, consistent advantage to being white these days.
Stop worrying about the small blessings white people enjoy and worry about what you are contributing to society.

Everytime I [15M] see attractive girls, my confidence level always goes down. I feel like I will never be attractive enough for them since I am unattractive and boring. I’ve never had a girlfriend and don’t know if I ever will. What should I do?
You have already decided that you are unattractive and boring, nothing can be changed unless your inner self changes its perception. Whatever it is, if you have the desire for something just ask for it, the universe will give you back what you want. It is not that simple. I will explain it lets us assume that you are an average-looking guy. I agree that your appearance plays a part but appearance alone is not enough to be attractive. Appearance only helps you to initiate things, after that what if you lack everything which needed to coexist with looks. Attractive is measured by confidence, enthusiasm, diverse knowledge, and physical fitness. These should exist in the way you walk, talk, and approach. First, change your perception. If you can't love yourself, how could you love others?so, Belie…

Why does my laptop ask for a network security key instead of the WiFi password on any WiFi network now?

This is my wife and this is how we live. She's had life long counseling for anxiety and depression (nothing helped her) but she wasn't diagnosed for ADHD until she hit 40. She can't take ADHD meds because they make her heart race ( anxiety then takes over) and we cannot find an ADHD therapist. <<←—- is there such a thing? Our experience is that diagnosed/undiagnosed is still the same, so my answer to the original question is:. Same as diagnosed ADHD. And Mr hands, here, has nailed it perfectly!

Why can't we control the noise in our mind(s)?
I wouldnt say its that simple. Practicing mindfulness is a lot like growing a plant— you cant see the changes every day, but they are happening and you just have to trust that. As long as you make an effort to practice mindfulness regularly, you should keep growing, just like if you water a plant daily, it will keep growing. Just try to be patient, and train your mind to stay in the present moment.

Why does PC constantly act like I have a VPN on?
Exactly what does a PC act like when using a VPN?
Using a VPN should not, in and of itself, cause “issues”, except that some web sites may not allow you to connect to them through the VPN for various reasons.
If this is the symptom you are referring to, your IP address could be blacklisted on the internet as one which is a known spammer, spreader of bugs and or viruses, or email abuser, for instance, and therefore “blocked” by the security software or policies set-up on those sites you may be trying to access.
search for, “is my IP address blacklisted?”
or tell us what else is happening

The whole ""impeachment"" is a fraud or by hateful Democrats, There are no honest people in Washington you think anything the president has done even remotely approaches Level of impeachment.
It's just the ultimate harass of an outstanding president when the Democrats have done nothing but attack obstruct and try to bring down in their fury over losing a 2016 election. The reason is the GOP is not taking it seriously is there's nothing in there to take seriously.
This ""do nothing"" Democratic Congress cannot point to one thing they have accomplished for the American people their time has been entirely consumed by trying to destroy this president, including three years of the entirely bogus Mueller Hoax which after three years it, $40 million, and 25 bedroom, mostly Democrat donor federal attorney investigators found NOTHING.
I think there are many many Americans who are furious with the conduct of the Democrats, how destructive, divisive, polarizing, and non-productive it is. Meanwhile, trump remarkably soldiers on reaching new heights and they called me greatly improve in the military and border security rolling back burden some regulation and greatlyy strengthening our foreign-policy After eight years I was totally incompetent performance by Obama.

Much of your reply is incomprehensible, and I can only hope those are all typos—otherwise we’re seeing only too clearly who the “idiot” in the room is.
Sadly predictable for Lefties is resorting to deprecation, insults and name-calling in place of any facts or truth—congratulations on having internalized the disruptive Alinsky playbook.
But what IS clear from your rather disjointed response is that you seem unable to understand the obvious differences between those in military and those in civilian service.
But again typical of Lefties, facts don’t matter too much when you’re consumed by emotionality.

Why do left-wingers cut ties from Trump voters?
Because unfortunately the Left has become totally intolerant of any speech or ideas that don't rigidly conform to their politically correct narrative. And being usually driven much more by emotion than facts or reality, they become vehement (and even violent), when confronted with ideas or speakers who advocate for positions that may differ from their own.
Unfortunately the left in this country have become the""new fascists”, doing everything in their power to suppress conservatives’ expressions of their ideas and opinions. Seems incredibly hypocritical of people who constantly say how much they support free-speech!

When Donald Trump says he will “drain the swamp”, what does he actually mean?
What Mr. Trump meant should be obvious—he was elected to change “business as usual” in Washington, where entrenched interest groups have long held sway over BOTH parties. Pres.Trump is independently wealthy, so he’s not beholden to any special interests for $$ support, unlike his predecessor(s). He wants to move Washington and its electorate back to actually representing the legitimate interests of the American people, rather than just taking care of themselves and those who send them enough money. And one can already see how much those entrenched politicians don’t like being pushed out of their “comfort zones”, by the incredible resistance and even attempts to undermine his agenda from both parties—incl. the unprecedented spectacle of the immediate past president spending most of his time a…

Why do Trump supporters say Trump is a “constitutionalist” when he is anti-free speech?
This Is just another sad example of the type of dishonest narrative which has been used by some on the Left since Mr. Trump’s election in order to delegitimize and undermine his presidency. President Trump indeed is a strong advocate of free speech and adherence to the Constitution in general, (Unlike his immediate predecessor.). What Mr. Trump has opposed Is the unfortunate tendency in recent years for some on the Left to try, sometimes by violent means, to block the free speech rights of those with whom they disagree. This development has been witnessed in many areas but most frequently on college campuses, which is very unfortunate since our colleges and universities are supposed to be outposts of open and free dialogue .

You have to visit Israel to see what s dynamic and Beautiful country it is, the only true democracy &best US ally in the Middle East. They are strong and respecters of equal rights for all who live there including women, gays, and other religious groups.
These human rights sre not regularly practiced in most of Israel’s islamic theocratic neighbors, most of which are intolerant of minorities, gays, & non-Muslims.
The Israelis i've also been able to develop a thriving, high tech economy able to draw investment from some of the largest American tech companies, and several Israeli scientists have one Nobel prizes. All this in spite of regularly occurring terror attacks from the Palestinian
Bizarrely, Israel is often unfairly maligned by the left-wing types and their media enablers, who for incomprehensible reasons seem to often accept @face value much of the highly distorted blatantly dishonest propaganda generated by the Palestinians.
in fact Arabs living in Israel are given full citizenship come up there in about 20% of the population, and Ihave the same rights as Jewish Israelis. If you ever get a chance to go, would strongly encourage it since you'll see what a shining beacon of light and amazing outpost of Judeo Christian civilization & democratic values Israel is, in stark contrast to many of its hostile and under developed
I'm not Jewish, but I have tremendous admiration for the industrious, courageous innovative, and very fair minded peaceloving Israelis & the in the fundamental decency of their culture. Americans who actually do go visit Israel come home invariably impressed.
THAT’S a brief summary of why such a high percentage of Americans, both Christians and Jews, love and support Israel.

There are numerous logical and factual errors in this response, which is so distorted that it unfortunately typifies much of current liberal narrative, aimed more at fulfilling a political agenda than telling the truth.
Just a few:Using hyperbole inappropriately to discredit an argument is a fave tactic of Lefties, designed to distort the facts:
Neither Pres. Trump or any of his Administration ever said “all Muslims are terrorists”. What IS true is that unfortunately the great majority of serious terror attacks world wide in recent years have undeniably been carried out by Muslims.
Neither Pres.Trump nor any of his Administration have said black people are NEVER treated badly by cops. What he and many of his supporters have said is that most police are decent,hard-working people trying to protect us and generally are not racists, so to paint them all that way as seems to be fashionable on the Left currently, is dishonest, unfair, and destructive of police morale.
And for someone trying to lecture us on the brilliant observation about “things aren’t always black and white”, you should easily understand the painful but verifiable reality that black people ON THE AVERAGE commit more felonies per capita than other racial groups. So a cop doesn’t have to be a “racist” to be concerned in dangerous black neighborhoods—other blacks are too.
I’ve never heard Mr.Trump or any of his supporters ever say “our military can do no wrong”—another of your distorted hyperboles to try discrediting a valid point, namely that like our police, we should be grateful to the mostly courageous, patriotic people who daily put themselves in harm’s way as military volunteers, to protect the rest of us. To demonize the whole military as somehow being “bad”, and often sympathizing with some very bad people (think: radical Muslims), the Left does a grave disservice to those courageous individuals in the military, as well as to the rest of us.
And your comments about Israel are so factually off the mark that they reflect either woeful ignorance of Mideast facts, or strong anti-Israel bias:
Again, your strained use of hyperbole saying something no one, even Israel’s strongest supporters have said, i.e., that Israel can do no wrong again is simply flat out wrong.
What IS true is that Israel is the Mideast’s only democracy, the U.S.’ best and most (only) reliable ally there, cooperates on many vital security issues with the U.S., and in general is a beacon of shared civilized Western values amidst a sea of brutal Islamofascist theocracies.
Not sure where you got your information about the Palestinians, but it’s completely counterfactual: 1. Israel hasn’t broken ANY treaties with the Palestinians—they have followed the only treaty ever ratified by both sides, the Oslo accords, to the letter. The Palestinians, who as part of the agreement finally renounced anti-Israel violence and terrorism, began breaking the treaty with new terrorism within months of its signing, and haven’t stopped since.
NO Palestinians have had one inch of land “taken from under them”, nor has one ever been forcibly removed from home. So since NO Palestinians have had their land “taken”, there are none who have been “shoven” elsewhere. In fact, sad truth of the matter is that none of Israel’s neighbors will accept any Palestinians, because those gov’ts. too are concerned about terrorism in their countries.
Land in the West Bank (aka Judea and Samaria) is “contested” territory between Israel and the Palestinians. If you knew anything about the region’s history, you’d be aware that the Jews actually have a much better historic and legal claim to that land than the more recently arrived Arabs.
And as for Israel treating its Arabs like “second class citizens”, nothing could be further from the truth. Arabs make up about 20% of Israel’s population (giving the lie to the absurd Leftist “apartheid”slander against Israel), and enjoy a higher standard of living than anywhere in the Arab world. They vote, attend universities, serve in the Knesset (Parliament), and are even on Israel’s Supreme Court! So can you explain again your “second class citizen” reasoning?
But probably your most repellent dishonesty is implying that the U.S.’ enemies are carrying out their vile terrorist murders because of some imagined grievances and thus somehow are justified. Again, your weak attempts at extremist exaggeration don’t succeed in masking the reality is that the U.S., again NOT perfect, but also is the only country in world history which has expended its resources and people on behalf on other nations. So the routine demonizing of America by Lefties is indeed something that many Trump supporters strongly dislike because supporting murderous radical Muslim murderers instead is morally indefensible and disgusting.
All in all, your badly misguided comments are actually a “poster child” for how dishonest and distorted much of the current liberal narrative has become. Enough people have finally realized that to reject a very flawed and corrupt Dem presidential candidate in favor of someone who loves America, supports our military and police, is for the same kind of strong borders that every other Western country (incl.Mexico!) has, and knows who the good and bad guys in the Mideast really are.
THAT’S why Donald Trump got elected and it had NOTHING to do with any of the nonsensical accusations about “Russian meddling”, for which we STILL haven’t seen a shred of proof.
Time for you and your fellow Lefties to accept the election results and realize that your candidate lost, for good reason.

Does the difference between an A and A+ matter?
Does it matter to you? The point of attending college is to learn as much as you possibly can from experts in the field . This may be one of the biggest economic investments of your lifetime. You are doing yourself a disservice if you are only on a quest for a high GPA. Conversely, if you are doing everything possible to gain the most out of your collegial experience, then the grade will naturally follow.
GPA matters on your first couple of job applications, but take the time now to truly immerse yourself in each subject. Your enthusiasm

What are the best activities to do with children when visiting Dayton, OH?
A bit outside of Dayton, in Yellow Springs, you’ll find Young’s Jersey Dairy. There is great food and homemade ice cream at both a sit down restaurant and a fast food-style eatery. Perhaps more importantly, the destination features mini golf courses, batting cages, a driving range, farm animals to feed and pet, and a variety of smaller activities for the kids. There are seasonal attractions appropriate to the farm setting, also. Right down the street is downtown Yellow Springs, which is an eclectic collection of shops and interesting people. My family lives just outside of Dayton, and we visit Young’s and Yellow Springs a few times each year.

How can you classify someone who doesn’t feel happy for other people’s/friends’ achievements and might even come to resent them for it?
At best, I’d classify them as someone battling deep insecurities. Perhaps others’ achievements somehow cause the person to feel inadequate, which says more about the individual than the achieving person.
At worst, I’d classify them as an envious person, someone who becomes resentful in light of someone else’s achievements. That vitriol or resentfulness is dangerous, because it can manifest itself in a number of unpredictable ways. That’s for another post though.

Why are narcissists unable to handle insults even though they delight in insulting others?
The hallmark of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a dangerously inflated sense of self. Narcissists tend to be very egomaniacal.
Considering this, it makes sense that they’d be unable to handle insults. In their minds, they are incapable of wrongdoing & consequently, that excludes them from being on the receiving end of an insult.
Dishing out insults is effortless for them though. This also makes sense, because narcissists have an insatiable need to feel bigger, better, and/or more important than others in order to feed their grandiose ego.
While a heteronormative person may be able to “take what they dish out,” narcissists simply cannot. They lack the self-awareness & humility necessary to see the hypocrisy in this kind of behavior.

How much debt can you realistically expect to accrue as a result of attending law school?
According to the American Bar Association, the average amount of debt law school graduates accrue is $130,000. That does not include undergraduate debt.

Why it is important to not stay with-Narcissist?
Because the mind games that Narcissists play at their victim’s expense will make you question your reality.
The lies they tell will range from minute to elaborate, but they’ll never admit that they’re lies.
The people with whom you have valuable relationships will eventually be turned against you, in the Narcissist’s attempt to isolate & discredit you.
And the longer you stay & try to convince yourself that the Narcissist will “come around” or maybe even revert back to who they portrayed themselves to be in the beginning, the more disappointed & demoralized you will become.
Not only is it important that you not stay, it is VITAL that you leave as soon as possible. Your future self will regret every moment you spent staying.

Law schools care, but I think the better question is, “to what extent do they care?” Law school admissions committees tend to look at applicants holistically, but there are some metrics that are more important than others, i.e. LSAT & cumulative uGPA. That said, admissions committees “care” about your grades from your 1st year of undergrad insofar as they contribute to your cumulative GPA & other parts of your application. For example, let’s say we have 2 applicants. Applicant 1: ended year 1 of undergrad with a 2.2 gpa, but graduated with a 3.5 cumulative gpa & scored a 160 on the LSAT. Applicant 2: ended year 1 of undergrad with a 3.5 gpa, graduated with a 2.6 cumulative gpa & scored a 150 on the LSAT. The applicants’ 1st year grades alone are indeed a factor in the admissions process. Howeve…

Will Acorns soon become a bank?
I’d be surprised if they didn’t. Just this morning, I received an email about Acorns releasing a debit card to its investors that allows Acorns’ “found money” partners to deposit rewards directly into the investors’ accounts upon using their debit card. It’s certainly a game changer in that there’s already plenty of incentives to use debit & credit cards that consumers have linked to their Acorns accounts. Now, folks may use an Acorns debit card without linking any new cards they may receive from other banks. With moves like this being made by the company, I see Acorns becoming a bank in the near future.

Is 40 years old too late to attend law school?
Absolutely not! When I began law school last Fall, there were about 9 or 10 students in the Regular Division that were 40+ and many more in the Evening Division, one of whom is a medical doctor over 60. 40-years old is not too old to do anything & any class-students and professors alike- will likely be glad to hear your insights and experiences about things.
Go for it!

Finally, I recommend that you stick to whatever it is you enjoy doing and obtain a leadership role in that realm. That may be a competitive sport, a debate team, or something else. Notice I have not said anything pertaining to law. This is because once you begin law school (& I can not emphasize this enough), you’re going to need an outlet, if you will. Something that you enjoy. Something you love, that helps you stay grounded and reminds you that all of this-although completely foreign to you now- will one day pay off ten fold if you see it through. Also, you’ll have plenty of time during law school to discover exactly what your interest in the field is. Law school is tough but it’s doable & I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor!
Hope this is helpful…

How do you detect psychological projection in oneself?
The only way to detect psychological projection in oneself is to practice self-awareness. Know what you're feeling and what is causing you to feel this way. Are you dealing with your emotions? Are you allowing yourself to feel without judging yourself? Asking yourself these questions will begin the process of becoming self-aware. It is definitely easier to sense someone else’s projection. We don't usually recognize our own patterns of thinking, because if we were to do so, it'd likely be painful to accept our own shortcomings and pitfalls. As a result, we tend to project our “stuff” onto other people as if to say “I’m not the problem. You are.” Pay attention to what you're saying and to whom you're saying it. If you are an introspective person, the difficult part isn't in detecting your proj…

It's a wonderful app, imo, because it invests spare change & allows you to make other deposits if you do choose. The best feature for me is that a withdrawal of funds takes about 7 days to become available in your bank account.

Which Penn State campus should I pick?
Some of the best campuses for student life are Harrisburg, Berks, Abington, and Altoona. There's a really great sense of community and support at these campuses. Plus, there's the benefit of students and faculty being more tight-knit (smaller student body). I'd say the list of second choices you mentioned are pretty solid, but if U-Park is your first choice, I’m sure you'll be fine.
Good Luck!

What does it mean to be a good mother for an INFP woman, specifically?
I’m a Mum to 3 boys; only the youngest now under 18. I obviously I can’t speak for all INFPs but there a couple of things that have felt very important to me as a parent and are perhaps particularly INFP-ish.
One is that I am first and foremost a friend. I’ve never been big on discipline and I consider myself only a general guide to what’s right and wrong and I’ve wanted them to have confidence in their own decisions. The sooner they started that the better. I must admit a part of this might be laziness. Confiscating things, naughty steps, and sticker charts are such hard work!! Having said that I’ve never had many problems with them and they’ve all turned out well in that regard so far. My feeling is that I know I can never set them a perfect example so it would be dishonest of me to be judgemental of them.
Keeping communication open has always been important. From the start I have spoken to them honestly and directly. I share a lot of myself with them, my thoughts and feelings. I’m not saying I dump my problems on them but I’m not afraid to display my feelings and speak from the heart. I ask their andvice from time to time too. After all communication is a two way thing. it’s worked out that that all three are surprisingly comfortable discussing all aspects of their lives with me now.

How fast can giving birth be? I am pregnant with my first child at the moment. I am really anxious about the birth and want it to be over as fast as possible.
I’ve had three children and each labour has been different. My first and third were about 12 hours. My second about six and I’d had him within 15 minutes of arriving at the hospital. I honestly think that my state of mind has a massive effect on both the length of labour and the amount of pain I experienced. My third child was definitely the worst and felt the longest and that was very much down to the fact that I was suffering from major depression at the time. With my second child I had a very speedy mostly pain free labour. I spent most of early labour at home and hadn’t really noticed that I was in labour. The pain even at its worst was comparable to mild period pains and the pushing stage almost felt enjoyable and exciting! I cherish the memory of it! Every birth experience is differ…

What do INFPs do sometimes without realising it?
I don’t know if this applies to other INFPs but it is something I’ve always had trouble with. A thing I do without realising it is flirt. I don’t think I do it in an obvious way but men do often get the wrong impression. There are several things that make this happen and they are INFP type traits from what I have read. I hate the superficial sort of chat that others engage in. When I’m talking to someone I have to give them my full attention. I show interest and ask questions. Sometimes I find I end up asking questions about the way people feel and their problems on just an initial conversation. I think men might be flattered by this. They enjoy the attention and therefore think I’m interested in something more. I also tend to be an agreeable person. I hate conflict of any sort and I ha…

How long do you have to wait after you dye your hair to wash it?
Right after you dye it. HAIR: Hair grows at the rate of 1/2 inch per month........ Growing long hair: You must condition it every time after you wash it. You must brush it with a very soft brush with wide bristles and round smooth tips on the end. Wash your brush in the shower or bath. No dirty brushes allowed! You must wash your hair at least 5 times a week if it is straight, 3 times a week if it is wavy, 2-3 times a week if it is curly and once a week if it is frizzy and kinky. You cannot grow dirty hair. Be sure to wash your scalp rigorously with your shampoo and rinse, rinse and more rinse with very warm water, then condition. Do it in the shower. It is easier that way. NEVER FORGET TO RINSE WELL. Getting rid of dandruff: Must wash your hair at least 3-4 times a week or every other day no matter what kind of hair that you have….sorry, kinky hair is tough to do but you can do it. While you are in the shower, have your brush with you. You need a brush that has very wide soft bristles with round tips on the end. Wash your hair with T-gel. Then condition with mild conditioner. Then, rinse, rinse and rinse really well with very warm water. Make sure all conditioner is pulled through the hair by brushing your scalp while in the shower and rinsing as you go. Make sure you do this procedure until you get your dandruff under control. It may take weeks or months so be ready for the long haul. Conditioning hair from breakage, to grow, to shine, to smooth out, to be healthy: You need mayonnaise from the regular grocery store. Smooth on the mayo through your entire hair and scalp. Put it on thick. The best mayo is Kraft. Then, smooth it down some more until it is flat against your head. Put on a thick plastic cap. Get an old towel, wet it down with water, place it in the microwave and heat it up as warm as possible. Put it around your head while wearing the cap. Leave it on until it cools. Leave the cap on for as long as you can….2-3 hours. Rinse well. Wash your hair, condition it with regular conditioner and rinse like crazy. The secret to healthy hair is a healthy scalp. A healthy scalp includes rinsing very, very well all the time. Hair fall-out: This is usually due to clogged hair follicles. That means you have to really get busy with washing your hair and scalp really, really well with a hair stimulating shampoo such as T-gel, Nioxin, or Keranique. After you wash, then you must rinse it well with very warm water and get all the shampoo out and all the conditioner off your scalp. I know it sounds repetitious but this is the way it is. Get used to it. Hair breakage: Same treatment with the mayonnaise.

I’m a minor to start with.I know this seems really weird but I’ve never have a stable parent in my life and When peopel answer on here it feels like I’m getting something I’m missing. Is that weird?
I am sorry your parents haven’t been there for you. I think it is perfectly normal to feel somewhat fulfilled when you get feedback. I believe everyone has that feeling to some degree. I wish you the very best. Keep looking for good role models and you will just fine in life.

Yes I removed the quotes but as someone that has suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts & been in treatment for 22 years & is 100 % ready to die, its hard to see that. That seems to be the main solutions that Ive heard for most attempts @ treatment & Im trying so hard not to be bitter. I apologize as that may help the average person dealing with mild depression or a temporary situational issue. I dont have the patience or energy. Im sorry 😞

Are you serious? “Just Just have a meal, some exercise & good sleep & everything will be ok"" ok. This epidemic of depression lately has gotten so many confused.. People are oblivious to legit, severe mental illness over attention seeking behaviors because of temporary sadness. Life isnt for everyone & sometimes there is no solution. Diet, exercise & sleep isn't a cure all. Hopefully someday all this will change.

I don't write many answers here but I'm wondering why every answer needs a photo. I'm an adult, I've long since stopped reading picture books. If the only photos one has are AI generated, it lowers the quality of the answer for me; just a little bit. So, can you tell me why writers seem compelled to put (unnecessary ) pictures in their answers?

From the advice I've heard (others give others), you're supposed to sleep, shower, do the laundry, and cook while the baby sleeps. Good thing there is two of you. Or maybe you have 8 arms. Shrugs.

Try deal with the fear sweetheart in the best possible way like talking it out rather than internalising it the fear is the hard bit it will always give you that extra tummy ache and extra beat in your heart but you can deal with it
just remember people have lost many souls but concentrate on your strengths and that will hopefully help you cope with loosing someone but don’t ever feel guilty for realising this it’s fear..it’s cruel..it’s wicked..but it is also an emotion we feel for self protection (aka will not walk on front of that noisy train/bus/car etc)
You will cope because you can and don’t be scared you will be fine because it is an emotion.
And don’t feel guilty for coping with it because it doesn’t make you live the person less. X

Hang on there! You are strong and brave for reaching out! I found these local phone numbers for you to call to a free counselor:
8919288 or 895270000 from Online Therapy & Free Counseling, Someone To Talk To
I also found drsafehands.com. Try calling 901 311 61616 to speak with someone for support. They also have online help via Skype or email. The first session is $9.00.
Try joining a Facebook support group for autism, and maybe you could even try one for other Atheists?
These are my suggestions for now. Let me know if any of this is of help. I am a 4th generation Polish person myself.

Well, I can see two hands. But the bottom section of the hand above looks like it could be a heart, and the hand below is squeezing it. I guess it signifies pain or heartache.
Nice painting by the way.

Are your thoughts focused on giving a child its happiness? Why?
Yes, my thoughts are focused on giving my child his happiness. I’m a single mother raising a ten year-old son since he was not yet two. He’s the happiest person I’ve ever known. He would often sing in the shower and chirp like a bird every waking moment. He’s a happy boy and I want him to stay happy as long as possible. Here are some reasons: 1. obviously reason (to me), he’s my son and I love him. 2. he’s a living thing who needs love and protection. 3. I chose to give him life so I should give him the best life I know how. 4. he makes me happy by being happy so I’m actually just making myself happy. 5. he’s like a work of art, the happier he is, the more beautiful I see my art becomes.

I have gathered enough evidence to come to a logic conclusion that I can build a loving relationship with him.
With that said, it is not to say it would take me forever to come to that conclusion. To love is to feel not to analyze. I do feel, but feelings alone don’t convince me that I’m making the right decision, so I can’t say I love. I can’t say love because I’m still unsure of myself, even though I’m already feeling it. It’s the analyzing part that that helps me making the concrete decision and once I decided on something I stick with it, hence wholeheartedly.

Did your children hold you back to your success, or did they push you more towards success?
I have a 9 year old son. We’ve been together, just the two of us, since he was 1.5 year-old. At first, as a single mother, I thought my goal should be to find someone to love and someone who would love him as his own. Besides working full time to earn money then come home to play with him, taking him to the park, to beaches and/or to family get together, I have no other motivation or goals. When I took him to the park, I mostly was too tired to play with him and just let him play with other kids or by himself as I watch him on the bench. I felt bad for him, but I couldn’t last more than 5 minutes engaging in a play with a 3 year-old. One day, as he was playing at the park, he wanted me to follow him and play “follow the leader,” so I did. Slowly, day by day, he somehow engaged me in bigger…

How can you teach your kid to understand the value of intrinsic motivation over extrinsic motivation?
My son is 9 years old. It would be a hard lesson to teach him, but I feel he’s reaching a point where I don’t need to motivate him much anymore. Here are what I’ve done: I talk to him. I’m a full time single mother since he was 1.5 year-old. I rarely have enough time to spend with him. But when we’re together, we talk. Everywhere we go, everything we do, I talk to him about the environment we’re in. I encourage him to observe. I encourage him to ask questions. Then we analyze what we saw. I first ask for his opinions of then I point out the why we see what we saw. I’m fortunate in that he has almost always been a good boy. He loves me to he tried to be responsible. But as he gets older, his priorities are more geared toward socializing instead of completing responsibilities. At first, I tried…

This is just me. When I do something, I want to do my best, so what I say here may not apply to you. I usually attend class in the evening around 6 pm. This is what I do to prepare for an hour of BJJ session and it goes somewhat like this: 1. I wake up at 6:30 am telling myself I MUST go to class today doesn’t matter what excuse my head is trying to feed me that morning. Excuses can range from the possible long day at work, or that I might be too tired, or that my body is still sore, or I just twisted my arm the wrong way yesterday, and/or I have no clean Gi left to wear, just to name a few excused going through my head. 2.

Similarly, once I love, I love wholeheartedly though not necessary spontaneously. As an INTJ, it’s not easy for me to be comfortable around people with no particular goal. Most of the time I rather spend my time learning something new instead of wanting to spend my time with others. So if I come to a conclusion that I love someone, I must have done a few of these things to some extent: 1. I have analyzed this person enough to convince myself that it is safe to be with him. 2. He must be interesting enough for me to want to spend my time getting to know him more. 3. I have trusted him enough to allow myself to open…

For those of you who keep a clean home, how do you do it? What tricks or techniques do you use?
This is what I do, not in any particular order:
Have a designated place for EVERYTHING.
Return everything in its place after each use.
If something can to be done within 2 minutes, I would just do it right away.
Keep a rag/sanitizing sheets on a kitchen counter top, one in the bedroom and one in the living room.
Don’t make big plan to clean. Clean as you go.
Clean out stuffs you don’t need or haven’t used in the last year, donate them.
Invest in an automatic vacuum and run it once a week.
The less stuffs you have the easier it is to clean. Cut down and donate something every season.
No shoes in the house.
Do laundry once a week in the evening and fold/roll your clothes as soon as it’s done before heading to bed.

Get used to seeing it again.
Tetanus is manufactured without latex or mold components. But in the USA is only distributed via a combination shot with DPT. That are manufactured with latex and mold components. When 40+% of north America is allergic to latex, and any mold allergy can kill you…. It will be returning.
& No, major hospitals since 2019 haven't been able to get a tetanus only vaccine in the USA.

Look up how John Burdos* was caught: because (1) set of parents refused to accept crappy police work, causing (1) detective to do a thorough review of attempted abduction / stalking / propositioning minors between school grounds cases. & Then his wife & mom called the police dept about a body part in the freezer.
He was the 1st documented case of his own class of serial killers: Burdosian.

Human being are such easily programmable, trainable species. The sad part is, too many of us (survivors) are trained & programed against our will, without our consent, at someone else's ( abuser) mercy, enjoyment, and wims. Abuse is the same as ABA, to make someone behave for us as we want them to, despite how they feel. Survival skills keep us alive. It is very hard to turn them off.
I just keep reminding myself that I am in control of me. In control of my emotions, my reactions, my life. I just have to reprogram my brain. Because no one will ever control me without my consent, again. It helps survivers to remember that we can be in control of how we react. Instead of letting the fear training that someone else chose my reaction. It takes time.
Remembering that abusers always pick the ones they fear to hurt & attempt to dominate out of their own fear.

Yep, not all men, but some men, indistinguishable from other men.
I'm the only known date that a serial rapist from Cincinnati didn't rape.
Why? He wouldn't discuss or negotiate the sex play he wanted for that night. We both discussed what we preferred, but untill he made a yes or know decision, nothing was going to happen. Not even a kiss. Shocked the investigators. Asked who did their psych profile…they didn't have one. Informed them they needed a psych profiler/ behavioral specialist on their case, really badly. He was trying to talk / con his way out of charges.
2nd interview with investigators & their psych behavioral specialist was much more interesting, in depth, and gave them a much clearer picture. And grounds to deny bail. Offered to be a witness for the prosecution. Because I knew he was a serial rapist after that (1) date.

Why does an attractive girl get attracted to nerdy guys?
Because too often, society doesn't realize that the “attractive” girl or woman is also a nerd ( or a geeky chic! In my case!)
And if your partner can't make you laugh, feel loved, and have an intelligent conversation: was it even a date?
It is Also amazing how many nerds & geeks are gym rats, & have serious stamina for….all their life plans! 😉

It was issued w/ in 6 wks of my birth. There were still people getting their 1st SS cards issued @ 18 to join the military the when I had my 3 rd re-issued@ 18. Wallet was stolen @ 16.
50 yes later, paperwork to issue it is started @ tthe hospital before being sent home after delivery. So much has changed.

I walked in to an SSA office @13 yrs old to get a new card, with my actual signature so I could get a food handlers card, a work permit, legal ID, the important stuff. They threatened to have me arrested for having a forged card due to it not being my signature. Asked for a supervisor.
He asked the best question: when was this issued? 01 MAY 1972. Why?
All military dependents are required to have one, & they will not let you leave the office w/ out signing it. Can a get one re-issued so I can sign it?
Should have seen the BS when I had it re-issued @18 so it had an adult signature….🤦‍♀️

What happens if you’re ten minutes late for court? What is the longest time the judge will accept for you to enter the court room?
It really does depend on the judge. I walked in 30+ min late for my case dismissal, only to not find my attorney there. The judge postponed the hearing refusing to let me speak without my attorney present. Even, as to why I was late. The attorney forgot I had court or that I was even a client. The office manager informed me the attorney wasn't taking any new clients, was shocked to find out he had missed a hearing. Then they couldn't even find my file. Reasons to always keep the original! Walked back in 2 wks later, with the originals, & had the case dismissed. Gave everyone a complete copy of the file, & again, walked back out with the originals.

If a debt collector comes to your home looking for someone that does not live here, what can you do about it?
A B*a Representative knocked in my door in 2009, looking for the owners of my house. As a renter, I didn't have to give them any information. But a legitimate business card & a lease later: the owner hadn't paid the mortgage in 6 m. The bank thought they had abandoned the property. They apologized for bothering us during dinner. 18 hrs later, I was at the bank w/ the account number, paying that's months rent directly to the bank. For the next 2 yrs. I refused to pay the late fees or the fines. Just that payment. The bank wanted me to open an account, make the payment by EFT: nope. I refused to transfer the loan responsibility to me or my name in any way. If I had, they would have given me $5k in overdraft protection, & then taken all the fees out of my acct. & I would have had to take the l…

Yeah, my local their store/ op-shop did that for the longest time. I would get off the bus & head directly to the bathroom. To not cause a hazard spill. & They kept trying to get on my case about not stopping to check in my bag. Till I has the store many join us, removed my purse ( w/ checkbook, planner, & prescriptive ) from my backpack. B/c I refused to hand any of that to anyone else. & Had them stowe my backpack (that I called weight lifting 40#+). I asked if they wanted to clean up a biohazard spill? Or could I please us the bathroom 1st? After they realized they couldn't pick up my bag due to weight, they stopped harassing me before or after the bathroom run. College student, heavy bag, transit user, & no car. & they stopped arguing about my purse, due to the RX's. Apparently, that issue or Legality hasn't hit their radar.

Spitting is a body fluid. He could have given her many blood born illnesses, including of it had hit her eye in any way, Herpes (HSV). That could have caused blindness. Don't tell me it's just a cold sore. Any mucus membrane: hepatitis & liver cancer.
That is attempted murder since 1985, & the identifying of HIV & AIDS.

I’m a 19 year old female. and I don’t want to keep living through these dreadful days , well I’m partially drunk while writing this, because that’s what I do now, I drink every single night to forget about my problems, and it maybe is making matters worse. Hmm let me tell you about me, I used to have a 4.0 gpa but I don’t care for school now, so I’m letting grades slip away now (sophomore in college) I used to care about my appearance, but even when I looked “pretty”, everyone still rejected me. so, obviously my self esteem is very, very low. However sometimes I feel like maybe I think too highly of myself? I have a spending addiction now because sometimes shopping helps me forget about suicide,
until night comes again. i don’t even get excited over anything anymore. even if I spend $300 on clothes, I just shove them in my closet and drink, (that made me sound rich, I’m not) however I feel so selfish because I love my family, and I have them. But sometimes I am impulsive and take medication to sleep and when I start driving I almost want to drive into something at full speed :/ what should I do? im only still alive because I don’t want my family to “suffer” :/ i love them so much, but I don’t love myself.

My body and inner-voice mind physically and mentally told me to be suspicious and fear her. My physical and emotional reactions varied from feeling numb, actually shivering, and feeling an adrenaline rush of self-protection.
The Cognitive Dissonance I felt pushed away my own feelings and rationalized that this can’t be happening.
I ignored and dissociated from many yellow and red flags for about two years. This was all very painful and confusing; however, deep down I knew something was wrong. My true self knew I had not done anything wrong to deserve this treatment.

No, you should be proud of yourself that you are thinking about it. Next, think of what grade you want to achieve, and your colleagues who are actually achieving it, associate and learn from them how you can get that desired grade.

Initial comment is poorly formatted.
A few counter points ::
Every country is a sovereign nation, including China and the EU.
China is also not a friendly state just ask what happened at Tinamen Square, or ask Hong Kong or ask Taiwan.
The EU moves with the US because the US funds the majority of financial aspects of it and the military aspects of it. Prove me wrong. So when the US says jump, they are likely to go along with it.
China doesn’t need to explicitly listen to the US. But as the worlds sole remaining super power. It’s probably a suggestion. Especially when tech, in various areas has been stolen by China, and China is trying to move in the area of financial services and helping other sovereign nations out (Looks at the belts and roads failed initiative). But it suggestion to take it into consideration. And if you work for the CPC, you need to work on your English.
Now to answer the initial question. The US warned China probably because everyone having Nukes means countries are more likely to use them. The US being the only country to have used them during war time and their are various issues with using Nukes. I don’t know if the US will increase its stock pile and I could not find anything to say that they will solely because of China. I don’t not know the strength of China’s Nukes but with the fairly recent issue with water in some of the missiles, it doesn’t look good. I can say that the Nukes for the US are some of the best, in terms of payload and how deployable they are.

How do I make myself have to pee more?
Short story is to consume more fluids. But there is an upper limit and too much water is actually bad for a person. One can pace it out. Make sure that electrolytes are taken too, they are kinda needed.

The child shouldn't be identified as they are underage and can't consent. consent.¶

Imagine growing up after being shown up, 20 years later, your Dr. Phil episode is on YouTube/the internet tagged with your full name. Being known for doing horrible things or embarrassing things borderline sociopathic things, as told in graphic, gory, embarrasingly-detailed stories by your parents for everyone to know who might Google your name for whatever reason. Even if you grew into a healthy, functioning adult, overcoming your childhood psych issues, I imagine that you would still harbor some hate for the morons that showed you non blurred.¶

Also, bullying.¶

I assume that another reason they don't want to show the child is because they probably would be easily identified by bullies in their town who will torment the child and shame them relentlessly.

How do you cope with chronic excruciating back and leg pain?
Sounds like sciatica. It is excruciating pain from your back and down that leg. I have to take tons of Aleve when it flares up. Aleve is an anti inflammatory, so you will need to take it every day several times for weeks or months. Once the sciatic nerve starts being less inflamed, it should eventually go away.

Hi,
I have a 19 year old nephew and I am 23 years old. So I'm his aunty. He has been making sexually inappropriate jokes starting this year and it has been continous and pervasive.
He take it a joke but I find it highly inappropriate and have asked him to stop multiple times but to no avail.
For example, he will be leering at me saying ""Hey let's go inside the room"" making sexually suggestive faces and take this as a joke.
Saying to me ""You are like an airport landing flat as hell, flat chest and flat ass, hahaha"", ""I don't know why your boyfriend loves you so much, you have literally nothing to offer, flat chest and flat ass, no fun in the bed"" while making sexual ""doggy-style gestures"" suggesting if having sex with me would be boring"".
I said to him back ""At least I'm not fat like your gf""
I had enough and finally snapped, I started throwing the nearest 2 hair combs at him and shouted at him to stop! He became angry because I called his gf fat but I'm not allowed to be angry or disturbed that he has been continuously making sexual incest jokes at me.
While all this is happening, my brother in law and own sister just laugh it off at his stupid, crass, lewd inappropriate sexual incestuous jokes targeted at only me! They said ""Come on, it's just a joke, so what if no tits?"" ""You're too over sensitive"" ""Come on, he also say I'm fat, I also okay cuz I'm fat"" to which I replied Fat and Flat is different!
He's looking at my chest and my ass and telling me this frequently that made me snapped. My sister and brother in law sided him. Should I Report Him To The Police for Sexual Harrassment? I've had enough.

Heyy, Sherri Young I am so sorry to hear about your childhood abuse and of how it has effected you as a adult. I hope you are well and I hope thing's will be a whole lot better for you soon. And the reason why I wanted to comment under your because I have also experienced Pyschological abuse as a young child and I've lost my Mom when I was only eight year's old. So, I've had a very tuff and hard childhood. Nothing about my childhood was normal or stabled. Now that I am 21 I often feel confused about many thing's. And I am emotionally unstabled which is I know one of the main effects of trauma and abuse at a early age. I often feel very different from a lot of people I am surrounded by on a daily basis It's just the feeling I get from being around people as if I don't belong in that environment. But I was diagnosed with clinical depression and general anxiety when I was around 15 or 16 years old but I have already started experiencing symptoms of depression before when my Mom first passed away. But when I was 19 I was diagnosed with ptsd because of how sensitive I am to certain thing's.

Do you need lessons to become a good artist?
To become a good artist you need lots of practice and dedication. Simply being talented or taking some Art classes isn't enough in todays art world. You need to work hard and be passionate and focused on your goals. Artists today are very likely to find all kinds of jobs.. Artists now dont have to rely on a gallery to deem them “an Artist” There are so many tools to learn.. Artists now have their own YouTube channels where you can learn so much. I do recommend taking classes, there is something about watching and listening to an experienced Artist, however you can also apprentice and you can simply start making something and keep making things till you get there!

Can I become a professional painter even though I'm 18 years old and I don't know even how to draw simple things?
Yes you can! Everyone starts at their level. Start by becoming an art student, take a couple classes at your community college or some classes are offered privately. Get your feet wet and start learning! Then you can become an apprentice for a local artist usually apprenticeships offer some kind of pay although might be small to start. Every opportunity to learn is good no matter how small!

We have a 16 year old daughter her and I have suffered a lot until now, depression, anxiety. I feel broken empty a year ago I start a relationship with a man he made my sadness go a little bit. he always listened to me, we had a relationship for almost a year which has already ended because he is married ... I got more depressed because I was a happy wife and then I became a somebody’s lover ... we decided to separate because we both knew we were not doing good.  we felt too much attraction each other we decided never to see each other again  now I feel terrible empty broken inside not only for my husband loss also for what I did and I was having  feelings for that person.I know that one day my sorrow will pass one day I will learn to love life. thank you for your advice help me a lot. please do not judge me. 😢

What is the value of wisdom when it confers no benefits to those who are deemed wiser?
Why does wisdom become invaluable when it confers no benefits to those who are deemed wiser? Anyways, to try and answer what I think you’re hinting at, I think the first thing to realize is that nothing in life is not for ourselves (please hear me out!). Joey Tribbiani was right. There exists no unselfish good deeds. Even if we do something for others it’s because we care. For example, if I want to make sure my girlfriend (doesn’t exist) gets to eat her favorite meal now, it’s because I care about her. My wanting her to be happy is because I care about her, so it’s fulfilling something for myself in the first place. Had I not cared about how she feels there is 0% chance i’ll do it, unless it fulfills something else for me. Now, if we can move on with the discussion with the idea that everythi…

How is logic the beginning of wisdom?
Wisdom begins with action/observation.
You don’t need logic to realise that something is wrong, all you need is intuition.
Logic should serve only as a catalyst in the acquisition of wisdom .
Using logic allows you to make better decisions and better decisions put you further ahead, allowing you to learn from the mistake that may have taken five poorly made decisions to arrive at.
We all learn at our own pace. Talented/gifted people start further ahead. So….

Happiness is a fluctuating process. How can it be made a lasting entity?
The key to living a good life is NOT attained by pursuing happiness. Happiness requires a trigger. However, the close second you can pursue is joy. Personally I’d like to think that happiness is the opposite of sadness, and joyfulness is the opposite of depression. Since depression is a perpetual state of sadness, then joyfulness should be the “perpetual state of happiness”. As with everything else, attaining the state of joy/contentment requires practice - meditation and practicing appreciation (penning them down on a journal of some sorts) to name a couple. Life comes in seasons. You get good days and you get bad days. It’s perfectly okay. When something good happens, you feel a little happy. When something bad happens, you feel a little sad. This flow shouldn’t be disrupted. If there’s only one…

What do you think is your true purpose in life?
There isn’t one. Your purpose is what you mean it to be. Imagine thousands of years ago when technology hasn’t existed and humans were just hunting for food. Everyone’s just responding to their situation and trying to survive. Someone decided to invent languages because he knew communication was important. Someone decided to build shelters because of the rain. Nobody was born to do anything; they chose to do what they saw fit. We can live because with enough distractions our mind doesn’t overthink. The way I see it, something either bothers you too little or it will bother you enough to drive you insane. If it’s the latter, start creating your purpose otherwise it’ll eat you alive. You don’t have to dream too big. Your purpose can as simple as striving to be an empathetic individual to making a ma…

What truth about life is both simple and complex?
We are innately biased.
People generally don't think bank robbers are smart.
People generally think a well dressed person with a nice office job is.
Criminals are definitely aware of all the consequences of their actions, they're not stupid. They are whoever they are now because of the way they observe the world and the way they think. As with everyone else, we're all just reacting to our thoughts.
We naturally associate “bad"" actions with negative traits.
That's not to say though that we shouldn't prevent crimes or have punishment systems in place.
It's just the way things are.

Is happiness a state of mind or a product of effort?
A product of effort, hands down. The only question at hand is whether the effort was put into it unknowingly. Hear me out on this one. “Happiness"" is result dependent. Something has to happen to make you happy. Likewise, its good ol' pal “Sadness"" is also result dependent. Something triggers it. Lets shift the focus to the true method of being “happy"" (I assume all the time =P). The real key here is joy. Joy is not result dependent. Joy comes from being able to be grateful, appreciative of things in your life and the such. Feelings of positivity, gratefulness and appreciation can be practiced through activities like meditation and eating better to improve your gut health which also improves your neurological health. The reason why I explained it to be whether it happens “unknowingly"" is because c…

Victim blaming/shaming doesn’t help anyone either. We don’t all act rationally when in intense situations and a lot of the time, narcissists and abusers isolate their victims from their friends and family so social media might be all that they feel they have now. I would respond with kindness instead of insulting their intelligence. That’s just me though.

I can relate whole heartedly to this I’m afraid. I’m currently sat crying my eyes out because I tried to voice the fact that I was upset and he turned it on me and said I wasn’t going to get what I want. I don’t know if you are still in this relationship but I am pretty sure that I’m going to have to leave mine. It’s heartbreaking to me because he’s so lovely sometimes too, but I don’t think he has much empathy and it’s not something I can work around.

You are the pilot, the inspiration, and the example.
I am deeply thankful and supremely respectful of those that teach.
My Mother is a retired educator and I know her love of learning (not the paycheck) as well as having her students teach her new things every day carried her for many years.
Thank you for asking yourself what YOU could DO for THEM.
And thank you for what you do!

Well nothing. It's called COVID-19 because this covid virus was seen for the first time in December 2019, hence the 19. COVID means: COronaVirus Disease, and it’s caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Hydrogen Peroxide Soap!
Jean Phillips
· Oct 12
Why does my intimate area “sweat” and smell so much? I almost have to have a shower everyday. How do I get rid of this?
My grandmother was the sweetest smelling lady one could meet. She had a lovely fresh looking skin till she died at 93. After her widowhood at 55 she bought a very old small brick cottage in her town, after she sold her farm, it had a very high bathtub in it and she was small, so as she aged it became a problem for her. So she (born in 1890) went back to her childhood ways, an old towel on the floor of her bedroom, a wash bowl of hot water, wash down as far as possible, up as far as possible, and lastly, wash possible. She was always clean as a whistle. She did it in her bedroom so others could use she bathroom. She did it every night. Went to bed clean and fresh. That was the reason (face) wash cloth's were invented. No one needs to be smelly and dirty if one has access to a bowl of water and some soap. Edit. Please answer the questioner with your advice, not my answer. It’s of no use for my sweet smelling, long dead grandmother.

What is the most clever life hack you've learned?
1. When showing people pictures on your phone, zoom in slightly to prevent accidental swiping to another picture. 2. Remember: You’re not rich enough to buy cheap things. 3. If you can’t stop your stream of thoughts at night, get up and write them down. This will set your mind at ease so you can sleep. 4. Get a few hours to kill on the airplane? Use it to declutter your phone by deleting unnecessary pictures. 5. In some social situations, you could hold on to your glass. It can provide comfort and security. Most importantly, you don’t have to shake hands. 6. Instead of asking if someone is free, just simply invite them. 7. Use unique photos that can't be tracked down your other social media accounts when date online to avoid scammers. Or choose a platform with verified profiles. 8. Learn a new language by starting with its 100 most frequently used words. Those will make up 50% of everyday speech and provide a solid foundation. 9. While telling a lie adding an embarrassing detail can make it more believable. 10. If someone is trying to make you decide in a hurry, they are probably giving you a bad deal. 11. Be selective with sharing your opinion. Save it for situations where it truly matters and is appreciated. 12. If you think of a good idea, write it down. Your brain will try to trick you into thinking you will remember it later, but it’s a liar. - UPvote if any of these is useful.

Stoicism · June 15, 2023
Here are some famous quotes by the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus: 1. ""Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for."" 2. ""It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly."" 3. ""Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist."" 4. ""He who is not satisfied with a little is satisfied with nothing."" 5. ""Of all the things that wisdom provides for the happiness of the whole life, the most important by far is the acquisition of friends."" 6. ""The art of living well and the art of dying well are one."" 7. ""The greatest wealth is to live content with little."" 8. ""Natural justice is a pledge of reciprocal benefit, to prevent one man from harming or being harmed by another."" 9. ""The misfortune of the wise is better than the prosperity of the fool."" These quotes reflect Epicurus' philosophy of seeking a simple and tranquil life, free from unnecessary desires and fears. He believed that true happiness could be achieved through cultivating friendship, living virtuously, and embracing a moderate lifestyle.

When you’re 90 years old, what will matter most to you? Why?
Breathing? Maybe dying. I don’t have a snowball’s chance in hell to make 90, but if I did, I think I’d wish I were dead. Family - none; friends - none; future - none. A bizarre culture that has passed me by. What you will have is pain aplenty, confusion, possibly dementia or Alzheimer’s. If you’re religious, you’ll be praying to be gone. Oh, I know; there’s always that rare 90-year-old who’s dancing in the streets. It won’t be you and it won’t be me because he’s one in ten thousand. By 90 the thing that will matter most to you is your cemetery plot.

Ketosis: Why can a ketogenic diet decrease the need for sleep in some people?
One issue not yet mentioned is adrenaline. When people who have low carb tolerance eat low fat high carb food, we release too much insulin. That insulin pushes fat into storage which is why we never lose while living low fat. But insulin also pushes blood sugar into the cells. In fact that’s usually listed as the primary function of insulin. Because we release too much insulin, there is still insulin in our blood when we start to run low of blood sugar. This causes a drop in blood sugar. Glucagon is released in indirect response to dietary fat and also in direct response to falling blood sugar. It’s how the body keeps a nearly constant blood sugar level. For those of us with low carb tolerance the timing is not good enough. We get high blood sugar peaks and low blood sugar valleys. Glucagon pulls fat from storage, but that only works in the absence of insulin. The other function of glucagon is to tell the liver to produce more glucose by burning more protein and/or fat. In fact that’s usually listed as the primary function of glucagon. There is another hormone released in response to low blood sugar, though. Adrenaline is also released in response to low blood sugar. And that will keep us awake. The low blood sugar only happens in the first few days, though. Soon our blood levels smooth out and we stop releasing adrenaline. Now there’s an opposite hormone reaction that has the same effect. Since we aren’t releasing adrenaline we are not kept alert, so we start to sleep more deeply. Since that sleep is more satisfying than the adrenaline interrupted sleep, we sleep better so we don’t sleep as long.

What is something that is absolutely worth the money?
One of my close family friends got married two years ago. Within seven months of his marriage, he had his first child. Fair enough! Two weeks ago, his wife gave birth to twins. I couldn't hold myself and asked him. “ You're just a data entry operator. Where was your mind, you idiot. How are you going to support three babies and a wife?” And he gently replied, “ I forgot to buy condoms.” This is an honest advice. No jokes! If you're married or are in a relation or you are the one who wanders around at night, buy condoms and keep it in your pocket or in your bag. It does not cost much, but saves you a lot of money and stress. It is absolutely worth the money.

No. I wish I had never been prescribed Ritalin and Adderal. It was absolutely life-changing when I first took Adderal. I thought all my problems were fixed. I became the best workhorse at my job and even started my own business. But everything started changing when your body's tolerance to the drug starts to kick in. My doctor had me going from 20mg to eventually 60mg a day. Eventually, I think it was after a year and a half that I really started to notice just how much I needed the drug just to feel normal. So without getting lost in all the complex details of medications and ADHD, I want you to think about one question. How important is sleep? Look at all the benefits of sleep and then look at all the negatives if you don't get your full 8 hours of sleep each night. These stimulants will destroy your sleep. “Complex dopamine theory and clinical studies suggest that stimulant medications may have the potential to cause tolerance and dependence over time but the data are unclear. Only time will tell what the “stimulant generation” will teach us about ADHD treatment patterns over the recent decades.” I would suggest the link below if want to read a trusted article from the National Library of Medicine.

Has anyone ever had a bad mental breakdown that ruined their life?
Yes and I’m so stuck I don’t know what to do. It happened 3.5 yrs ago and I’ve been ill ever since. I was in hospital 6 months ago as I got very ill and suicidal, I was in for 5 weeks and it was awful. I still really struggle to do the basics of daily living, I live alone so I have no one to help me. I’ve lost everything, and my mam has had to look after my 2 beautiful very loved children since September 2020. I’m absolutely devastated. I see them but I just can’t cope with life, I try all the time to push forwards, I need to get well to be able to be their mother again but I keep hitting brick walls over and over. Now I have fibromyalgia, brought on by the trauma of these last few years. I have to contend with fatigue, all over muscle pain, major depression and anxiety, and loneliness. Th…

I’m sorry, that’s not true. You do not need to have been through a life threatening event, ptsd can be caused by any very frightening or distressing event or after a prolonged traumatic experience. It’s important that people know this. You are right in the rest of it, hyperarousal is extremely distressing to live with.

How are you supposed to react when your toddler daughter is ""humping"" things?
This is totally normal, if it’s just sometimes. Just tell them that’s something you do in private and discourage them doing it in front of others. I used to say you can do that in your bedroom and she got the message right away, it didn’t become a problem. She used to do it before falling asleep. Then I think she grew out of it. It’s natural for kids to explore their bodies.

Which thai university has the best international BBA (bachelor of business)? The school should be considered ""good"" in Thai society and ""ok"" in Western.
all Thai universities are lowly ranked even in Asia. No Thai university has any status in the West. In Thai society it’s “ good” if you graduate from abroad anyway. Hope that helps.

Except that fame didn't just land in Jim Carrey's lap, as you imply. It was a long hard slog for him too, starting in the mid Seventies at age 15 (he bombed the first time he stepped on stage) until the early Nineties when Carrey finally hit the big time. Look in Wikipedia, you can find a detailed account of his slow climb to stardom in the 'Career' section.

For my money, From Russia with Love was the best Bond film. It follows the book very closely, and the book was excellent. One difference was the girl on the billboard was Marilyn Monroe, not Anita Ekberg. (The title of the chapter in the book was “The Lips of Marilyn Monroe.”)
Robert Shaw was intimidating as Red Grant, and every other character and scene of the movie worked. It was a tight and credible cold war thriller in which SMERSH (Death to Spies) almost brought down Bond and MI6 by their own arrogance.
Goldfinger was very good too, and massively entertaining, but to my mind, the silliness that became a hallmark of the later films started to creep in with Goldfinger.
I mean, Auric Goldfinger invites the bosses of the top families to his hideout and then gasses them to death. That didn't happen in the book, because it's ridiculous that they would fall for it.

What things can we do to soothe ourselves when we are hurt?
When we are hurt, there are things we can do to soothe ourselves. A lot of it is based on what a good parent would do for us, if we were a child. 1. Be kind. 2. Be reassuring. 3. Be realistic in an optimistic way. 4. Plan something fun as a treat. Be Kind & Reassuring Some people believe that kindness has to be earned. I do not. Sometimes we need to be extra kind to ourselves when we believe that we are at least partially to blame for our hurt feelings. Example: You did not get the grade or promotion you hoped to receive, or someone rejected you. You realize that you could have worked harder or chosen better. You have taken your share of responsibility for the disappointment you now feel and you plan to learn from the mistake. Now it is time for kindness and reassurance. Speak to yourself in a soothing voice and say something like: It’s not the end of the world. I learned something important from my mistake. I am unlikely to do it again. Be Realistic Everyone makes mistakes. I will get other opportunities to have what I want. Better to learn from this mistake now, than later. Plan a Treat I have done all I can do right now. I have learned from my mistake. Instead of beating myself up, I will plan a treat to cheer myself up. I love book stores. I think I will go wander through Barnes & Noble and buy that new novel I read about. Punchline: Kindness is contagious. It is free. You can give it to yourself first and then spread it around like the flu. Elinor Greenberg, PhD, CGP In private practice and the author of the book: Borderline, Narcissistic, and Schizoid Adaptations. www.elinorgreenberg.com

Would you be saying “it takes two to tango"" if this was a battered woman case, with ordinary people, with the man doing all the things Amber did, and the woman was like Johnny? Your comments smack of victim-blaming.

I agree with most of what you said. I would amend #5 myself, and use the term neo-liberalism, because Neoliberals pretend to be for the people but are really for big business. Like Obama bailing out Wall Street and mostly leaving Main Street to fend for itself. Real Authentic liberals like Franklin Roosevelt put the people first, and in fact incurred he was hated by the emnitybanksters. As he said, “They are unanimous in their hatred for me… and I welcome their hatred.”

I had my Primary Cere Doctor move away with no notice. She’d been my father’s doctor for a few years before she became mine. I was with her for almost fifteen years. It was devastating as her care had been excellent. Emotionally, it was like losing someone to death. No explanation. Just gone. I actually grieved the loss. I’ve since located that she’s now practicing in another state. I’ve thought many times about writing her to thank her for the care and compassion she showed my dad and myself over the years. I’ve not been able to because I’m still bothered by the feeling of abandonment. I get that circumstances in lives change etc but it really has been a difficult transition that would have been easier if it wasn’t so abrupt.

I had taken a second job working part time as a cashier in a gas station convenience store. We had one of those little trays where you could leave or take coins if needed to complete payment. Similar to this one: So customer comes in to pay for gas hands me $14 in cash and then proceeds to take the change from the tray, counts it and sets the change down and pushes it towards me and says, “Make that $14.53” I was dumbfounded, looked at the change and then looked at the tray then I authorized him for $14.01 and put the remaining 52 cents back in the tray and told the customer that they could only take a penny.…

My favorite McDonald’s breakfast order consists of a sausage McMuffin with no egg. Just sausage, cheese and muffin. I add pickles (three and please lay them so I get a pickle in every bite) and mustard. Sometimes I order two. I also order one hash brown and a grape jelly. Then I spread the jelly on one side of the hash brown. Finally, a Diet Coke to wash it down. Now before you tell me that it sounds gross, I will say try it then give me your opinion. It can be frustrating sometimes because the order taking person will give you some reason they can’t do the pickles and mustard until lunch is served. They can and will.…

Why doesn't DoorDash deliver meatloaf?
DoorDash delivers what the restaurant has on the menu. In some cases the full menu may not be available for delivery. Using the customer app for DoorDash, I just did a search for meatloaf and several restaurants popped up. So, I’d do a general search and if it doesn’t provide the results you’re looking for, you may be in an area where meatloaf isn’t popular. I can’t imagine that though.…

How do you order ahead at In-N-Out Burger?
Unless you’ve got an unusually large order, you don’t order ahead. If you’ve got a large order, you can contact the manager and if possible then they may work with you to have your order ready at a certain date and time. This should be days in advance. Also, be prepared that a large order to you may not qualify as a large order to them.

Does Instacart give you a receipt?
Instacart delivery does not supply a store receipt. Your receipt is available online in your app. Instacart prices sometimes fluctuate from in store. You’re ordering from Instacart and they often have sales or promotions not available in store and vice versa.

I like how you are taking this in a lighthearted manner ;)) I have the exact same shoe / feet size as you. Except I’m a woman and only standing at 150cm.
My dad is 180cm and has rather small feet too. US 4 if I’m not wrong.
So far here in Asia or Singapore, I’ve never encounter another adult who has feet as small as mine.
I always feel embarrassed shopping for shoes at stores as people never fails to give me the funny look. I can understand that they may be curious or amazed by the size of my feet, still… I can’t help feeling awkward / embarrassed.
Can I ask.. how do you shop for shoes? And how do you feel when you are out at retail stores shopping for shoes, especially when you have to ask for a specific size?
And ya, I wear kids shoe as well! Haha~ 😜

There are cctv all over the condo, so safety is assured in condominiums. Not too sure about older condos though.¶

most condominiums.¶

Cleanliness is great. The cleaners keep the entire area very well, from the car park, all areas within the condo, even my unit area! The auntie will mop the area at my unit every morning.¶

area.¶

Again, great security. Most condos have security guards. Some people say tailgate people into the condo. For my condo, lift access is needed for every individual floor & the security will need to see your access card. If No card… sorry, no entry. If SO lucky someone manage to come into the condo, they need to think of a way to get out. Access card needed to exit the condo too.

When i need to get something fix, salesman tend to overcharge. For example change lightbulb driver. That guy charge me $200 just to change. In my hdb, only $50!!! $50! Lesson learnt: Ask for black & white in Whatsapp before they come over & mark up.¶

I have this issue - some friends (even long time friends) give me the sour grape when they know I upgrade to stay condo. Say things like.. oh your kitchen very small… hdb better. Oh… aiyo stay condo no maid ah… poor thing…hdb hdb better. Oh so when you going stay back in hdb? Your condo nothing special ley… my hdb better. Your ceiling so low (3m), my hdb better. Im sad because while Im happy for them when good things happen to them… this is what I get when i stay in a condo. And some of these are said to me during my house warming. Imagine my sadness that day. There are plenty of positive words too but I cant help being affected by the -ve. Do any of you face this issue when you upgrade to private housing?

I do not think so. I feel very safe staying in Hdb and the Hdb I live previously is clean & very quiet.

This answer is completely accurate for me and how I am ! Explained super well! And just made me feel better too . Even though I try to improve everyday .. I am still borderline sometimes ,and it's hard to deal with but I've done everything to stop it and I have to accept some parts of it will always be with me as much as I fight it unfortunately.

Definitely one of the worst of my triggers. For me, It's the fear of not being good enough and thinking every other person may seem better to your partner than you in one way or another. When I thought my partner was for example chatting some other girl the fear,anxiety and rage that flew through my body was and can be so extreme that I'm about to pass out.thinking rational goes out the window. The fear of your world fallingapart.
but I've built so much trust with my partner it doesn't get me as much . An odd time like when he is out without me or going away I freak the absolute fuck out … fearing that he will cheat or leave me for someone.

….the above response is comprehensive in its suggestions— well-spoken and clinically sound. Many individuals require pharmaceutical help at various stages and periods of life. In fact, life is truly challenging for all of us and we need to build healthier communities, getting/giving support through relationships. We’re incredibly isolated in these busy lives and not always taking care of ourselves. One’s ‘mental health’ increases when it’s modeled through healthy communities.
I would also add: information is power. Keep asking questions about your diagnosis? What is your treatment plan? Learn about outcomes? Do NOT increase, decrease or stop and medication without consulting with your provider.
*Join or develop a support network
*Get on the web and do your own research
*Learn from others and connect with others
*Seek the counsel of your elders \ a wise person, or western medical professional

…..ya know, the truth is: Buddhist’s and their belief systems are diverse. I would say that, depending upon specific geographic location(s), Buddhists and Buddhism populated every corner of the world, and therefore, Buddhist practices and Buddhist beliefs take on the flavor of their homelands.
Also, there are broad diversities of language and cultural.
To answer your question: The Tibetans, particularly, have richly embellished pantheon of demons in their archetypal pantheon of gods and demons, etc. ……here’s a smattering of interesting deities.
<Top 10 Demonic Deities in Tibetan Buddhism >
——Keep in mind that Buddhism is the third largest ‘religion’ on the planet ,so Buddhists are spread across the globe.
In closing, Buddhists are linguistically and culturally diversified, as well. too! Namo Buddhaya!

What is the worst advice a therapist has given you?
I had to change ther…
Side note: During that session, she amazed me about how little she understood about eating disorders. She also told me I should do a diet of only eating 300 calories one day so “I can binge the next day and still not gain weight.” I honestly don’t know which advice was worse. If you have an eating disorder PLEASE get a therapist that has been trained in this area.area. It makes all the difference.

What is the worst advice a therapist has given you?
I had to change therapists for more intensive treatment. The therapist I was seeing at the time I loved, but I could only see her once every two weeks. My life wasn’t manageable and I needed more therapy sessions. A therapist who could see me every week was recommended to me by a friend. I went for treatment of an eating disorder, anxiety and depression. When talking about my anxiety she said “ we’ve been talking about how anxious you are but you really haven’t given me any reasons for you to be anxious other than your body image/eating disorder” I explained to her that my anxiety was directly due to my body image/eating disorder. She told me to just “think positive” focus on the hear and now and just not to worry about what other people think. I stopped seeing her after that session. Side note…

Assume that no energy in the form of heat is transferred to the environment. (Heat of fusion = 333 J/g; heat of vaporization = 2256 J/g; specific heat capacities: ice = 2.06 J/g⋅K, liquid water = 4.184 J/g⋅K)

They had a rating scale to indicate how close Tylee was to death. As the date approached for Tylee to be murdered, Lori texted with Chad about it. She asked him where Tylee was on the scale (with zero being it's time to die), and he indicated Tylee was at a two. She complained and pushed him to do it faster. That's just one example of her own highly manipulative machinations. She's a malignant narc and the evidence was probably there from the beginning. She's also prob a psychopath who has delusions with a religious bent. IMHO, lol.

Perhaps he was attempting to express gender neutrality rather than making broad implications. It could also be a way to express a singular “they” vice using the well-worn “he/him” to include all gender identifications.

I believe to find both girls pretty but in an overall statement, I would say Kendall Jenner is more of a natural beauty, compared to her younger sister Kylie.

I see I see. I have difficulties closing my mouth when sleeping(weak/long throat muscles), aswell as saliva issues and I have an underbite aswell. Another thing that comes to mind is yawning and how nerves get sent to the back, we try to stretch out back, probably because of tight abdominals from sitting all day(which inhibits deep breathing). The back is then supposed to go in to the well known yoga pose called ‘cat pose’ to stretch out the abs.
I also suffer from restless leg syndrome which is most likely caused by a compressed nerve in the pelvis.

I am bipolar type 1 with mixed episodes. I want to learn more and also see if anyone has the same experiences. So, what are some of your experiences having mixed episodes?
I have had two major mixed episodes in my life, one when I was about 18 and the next when I was 31 (this year). Both of these episodes were without a doubt more difficult to manage than any other (hypo)mania or depression I experienced at other times. Why is that? For one thing, the mood swings during the mixed episodes were off the scale and the psychotic features, delusions and hallucinations, were the icing on the cake that made me fear for my sanity as it went its merry way, leaving me alone in a nightmarish merry go round of self destruction and agitated anxiety. Both of those mixed episodes came into my life in similar ways. First, there was a ridiculous amount of stress in my life. As a teenager I was close to finishing school, having in the past dealt with mobbing by peers and recent…

How are bots stealing artwork from artists on Twitter?
Some bots are programmed to look for text around an image found for example in a blog, and then to make it available on an entirely unrelated part of the internet. Take for example a post on social media which includes an image (the art in question) and the text reads something like “This is such beautiful artwork! I want it on a t-shirt!” the bot can download the image and automatically make it available in a scammy e-shop. For more information, take a look at this video, I found it very informative - it’s also great to see the art community’s response once they figured it out:
Hope this helps!

Your description applies so well to my own situation. I hae been diagnosed with both bipolar disorder and ‘quiet’ BPD. In my family problems were generally swept under the rug or covered up with “we aren’t dysfunctional, we love each other so much!”. The love surely was there, I don’t doubt it, but the management of “bad” feelings was unhealthy. There was no arguing, no shouting, only ‘discussing’ in quiet, “civilised” tones. We moved house between continents twice when I was around 12 years old, and after facing mobbing and social expulsion from peers from that point onward, by the time I was grown up I had bottled up more than my fair share of rage and anger and despair that should have been vented in a healthy way during my teenage years. But in our family there were no “problems”, we were “perfectly functional and happy”. So growing up, there were no tantrums, good behaviour in social situations, few rules broken; and then there were my dirty little secrets of self-harm, suicidal ideation and several half-hearted and one fully intentional attempt; a whole lot of retreating into my own inner universe of demons chasing their own tails. I was diagnosed with BPD in my early 20s but it wasn’t until recently (I am 31) that I started therapy and my eyes were opened to the sheer amount of factors that contributed to my truly dysfunctional relationship with myself.
What strikes me as interesting here is how quiet BPD can be encouraged both in a family with overt abuse (physical or emotional) but repression of emotions in the person with or developing BPD, as well as in a family like mine that is convincing itself that everything is fine so strongly that the person with or developing BPD is ALSO convinced that everything is normal and fine - with the exceptional of oneself, who on the inside is somehow flawed; and lacking a visible abuser or dysfunctional input from outside, the natural conclusion is “then something must be wrong with me”.
Even though ‘quiet’ BPD looks quiet from the outside, it’s anything but inside, the storms raging within can be disabling. My personal challenge is learning how to allow negative emotions to surface in healthy ways that are not self-destructive. I am afraid of my own aggression, never having made the important experience that showing anger is okay and that people can still be friends or family or partners despite having a row, that feeling hurt and rage does not make me a worse human being, that defending my own borders is healthy and not an insult or affront to people encroaching.

he/she is trying to say that a respectful husband or wife would respect it if their spouse is not in the mood for intimacy. he or she would understand that maybe their spouse is tired from working and needs a bit of rest and would just move on with life until next time. meanwhile a selfish person, who is also a cheater, regardless of their genders, of course would take this an opportunity to cheat. moral of the story, get married to a respectful person, not a selfish bigot full of egos.

Hi. Sorry for what you’re going through. You're a strong woman. I'm no therapist or psychologist, so please take my opinion with a grain of salt. Based on what you described, sounds like your husband might be on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic people might feel uncomfortable with physical contact such as hugging and sometimes engaging in small talk can be hard for them. Does he also exhibit other characters such as avoiding eye contacts, sensitive to noise or lights, prefers routines, or having a special interest?

What would you do when you're a photographer and you see someone about to be shot dead?
I will capture how he/she is capturing the body.
Perhaps someone else do the same and the whole things are getting repeat and repeat⋯⋯

Why is there this stereotype that Black (African-American) men are extremely disrespectful?
Well where do I begin . In the So called African American Community if that is what you want to call it disrespect is not only accepted its encouraged. I'm 44 yrs old and I have never encountered a more disrespectful and just outright hateful race of people than the So called African American. We have an African-American president but black people are still as ignorant as ever. The black community is constantly complaining about the atrocities that have been perpetrated against them but Wiil not take any responsibility for their own actions. It is constantly the fault of the racist white system. I used to believe the rhetoric that was spewed but the So called modern leaders of the black community but I've seen a consinstant denial to accept the fault of the African American Community for its current condition . If I could name one race that is consistantly the most hateful and disrespectful it would be blacks. I am so sick and tired of the the excuses none of you alive today was in slavery most of the African American generation under the age of 50 did not experience any form of segregation but you complain about everything. I have had my car broken into by African Americans I have had my house broken into by African Americans I have been more disrespected by African Americans than any other race of people that I've ever encountered. The culture of black is a disgusting embarrassment and I am African American

Why am I scared of some people? Even random people I dont know. how do I stop being afraid of other people? I always feel like they want to harm me, and get anxiety from it. how do I stop this?
Let me first say, I am so sorry, you feel this way..this could perhaps stem from somewhere in your life where you have been hurt from ppl..ppl maybe that you trusted..going back and going through healing will help you clear this old pain..so you can be on solid ground again with yourself..at the same time, you should pay attention to your gut about certain ppl…this after you've healed could be pointing out certain patterns of unhealthy choices of ppl to have a relationship with…but don't ever live your life in fear, because no healthy/good choice can come from a place of fear! Be strong in who you are…work on just you..build yourself up…be the best you, you can be..😉💕💛💜💖

How did exercise change your life?
When I started exercising, I was skeptical that it would make much of a difference in my life. Little did I know that it would completely change how I lived and how I thought about myself. Here are ten ways exercise has changed my life for the better: 1. I'm No Longer Out of Breath Climbing Stairs: This may seem like a minor accomplishment, but I used to be completely out of breath after taking just one flight of stairs. Now I can take them two at a time, much to the amusement of my friends! 2. I Have More Energy and Stamina: I no longer get tired after a few hours of work. Exercise has given me more energy and stamina to get through my day feeling energized and ready to take on anything. 3. I Feel More Confident: Exercise has done wonders for my self-confidence. Knowing that I can do something physical as challenging and demanding as exercise makes me feel like I can accomplish anything. 4. My Clothes Fit Better: Since I've started taking care of my body through exercise, my clothes finally fit the way they should. Gone are the days of trying to squeeze into a size that's too small! 5. I'm Healthier: This one is obvious, but it bears mentioning. I've become healthier overall since I started exercising. My blood pressure is under control and I no longer suffer from aches and pains after a long day at work. 6. I'm Eating Better: Exercise has made me more mindful of the foods I eat. I know that if I want to see the results from my hard work in the gym, I have to fuel my body with healthy and nutritious foods. 7. I'm More Social: I used to be the introvert who never wanted to leave the house. Now that I'm exercising, I'm more likely to meet up with friends and be social. 8. I'm More Productive: Exercise helps me stay organized and on top of my tasks throughout the day. The endorphins I get from a good workout help to keep me energized and focused. 9. I'm Sleep Better: Working out helps me to get better quality sleep. I'm no longer tossing and turning all night, and I can wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. 10. I'm Happier: Exercise has made me a much happier person overall. Knowing that I'm taking care of my body and giving it the exercise it needs has a positive impact on my mental health. Exercise is one of the best things I've ever done for myself. It has changed my life in so many ways and I'm grateful to have discovered the power of getting active. So, if you're feeling hesitant to start a workout routine, I encourage you to give it a try. You might just be surprised at the amazing changes it can bring to your life! I hope this article has given you a better idea of how exercise can benefit you. So get out there and start exercising! You'll be glad you did. If you like my post, please share it with your friends and upvote it! Thanks for reading and happy exercising! Cheers, Your Friendly Fitness Guru.

Bad experience at favorite nail salon
Today I decided to get my nails, toes and eyebrows done at my favorite nail salon. I picked out my color and sat in the spa chair as I’m sitting she greets herself and begins doing my toes , as she does my toes she snatched my leg so she can scrub my heels in a hateful way. Fast forward we get done with my feet we move on to my nails she then again snatches my hand and rushing and when we get to my eyebrows she places the mirror on my stomach so I can grab the mirror and see the results , as she waxes my eyebrows she aggressively hits the mirror that’s on my stomach (my eyes are closed due to waxing) and continued to do that then after I though she was done waxing my eyebrows she pushes me back by my forehead then after she said she was done she pushed me forward and ran out. ( I DID NOT LEAVE A TIP) I did nothing to this woman, what should I do next time this happens (I have severe social anxiety so I didn’t say anything)

I get nervous when I face interviews. How can I overcome it?
1. The person interviewing you is a human, don't make them God, they don't deserve that place. 2. Being rejected in this interview will not end your life, you will still be alive and eligible to live a happy life. 3. If someone doesn't consider you worthy today, it's because of their own shortsightedness or lack of certain skills, at least you get to know where you lack. 4. Experienced people don't prefer intelligent cowards, unless it's a desk job, they need confident people, show confidence. 5. Believe in destiny, you are walking on a destined path, walk peacefully or cry, you will still have to complete the same journey. 6. Give your 100%, in preparation, more you learn, more you lose fear of facing questions. 7. Close your eyes a few minutes before an important interview, think about the person you love the most, feel their importance and go inside. That’s it! Rock it!

Why do I seem to get depressed when I don't work?
I suffered my most serious bout of depression during a time when I was unemployed. I also learned that much of my self worth is tied to my employment. I have always had an impeccable work ethic and prided myself in a job well done. I had never realized how much of a perfectionist I was when it came to work but once I was unable to perform, my mental health suffered. I wonder if you can relate to this? You are so much more than your profession. Work definitely provides purpose in life but isn’t the entire definition of who you are as a person.

Why do I still feel really depressed every now and then even though I am on meds?
Yes. It is possible an increase in medication is needed, an adjunct should be prescribed or different medication is needed altogether. A medical professional should be consulted.

Is it normal to go into a depression almost one year after my father passed away? He passed last September. I'm very prone to depression and anxiety. I've also moved, got married and started a new job in the last year.
Everyone grieves differently. It sounds like your life has been very busy since your father passed. I am not a medical professional but maybe your life has slowed down just enough to fully grieve. Anniversaries can be particularly difficult also.

If I’ve taken Zoloft before, then taken a break and gone back on, will it take less time to start working?
In my experience, the meds have taken around the same amount of time to start working except for my third time around with Zoloft. If you need the medication, the best advice is don’t ever stop it! I thought I would go all natural; make dietary changes and add in some supplements and exercise and that I’d be better than before… I was so very wrong!! I fell into the deepest, darkest pit of medication resistant depression ever. I tried taking Zoloft again and increasing it and increasing it to the point of absolutely terrible side effects without ANY sign of relief. I finally found a medication that helped but I wish I had just stayed on the medication to begin with.

What would be a good alternative to Wellbutrin for depression? It works fast, no weight gain but at some point I become angry and have to stop taking it.
The same thing happened with my sister in law. I would recommend Zoloft… I’m sure some people gain weight on it but I didn’t experience that side effect. I do think it took a bit of time to really feel relief though. Good luck!

Ever since I took Zoloft it feels like the front side of my brain isn’t connected to the rest and I am stuck in a blank minded state. Has anyone else experienced this and can it go away?
I believe these feelings are common with many antidepressants. Many people get brain fog or may feel somewhat numb. I would talk to your doctor about how you are feeling. I also think it’s worth a shot to stay on the medication for at least six weeks and see if you have any improvement. I think the worst I dealt with were stomach upset and insomnia. It’s amazing what we are willing to live with in our fight against depression and/or anxiety. Good luck!

What are some techniques (other than medication) that can help ease someone's anxiety or stress?
Hi Nick! I think other techniques can be very helpful depending on the severity of the anxiety. At one time my anxiety was so out-of-control that only medication was helpful. I was even anxious about taking the medication but the anxiolytics are truly a rescue medication to be used for times like these. Hopefully your question isn’t due to a situation this drastic. Other therapies include cognitive behavioral therapy, talk therapy, bio-feedback and meditation. Other ideas to try are changing your diet such as eliminating caffeine and adding vitamins and supplements like magnesium and B vitamins. Physical activity and proper sleep hygiene are important as well. Good luck!

Why are doctors so quick to diagnose anxiety and depression?
I believe doctors may be quick to screen for anxiety and depression because they are very prevalent conditions. Many times they are found to be a primary disorder or can be determined to be secondary due to another condition such as Alzheimer’s disease or a deficiency such as folate or vitamin D. Speaking from experience they can be serious, agonizing and life-threatening conditions that can be treated. I hope you haven’t been diagnosed with either conditions but I think it’s important for doctors to screen for behavioral health disorders as well as physical health conditions.

Will depression ever be considered “in remission” if I have to take medication for the rest of my life?
Yes, the goal is to treat the depression by whatever means so that it is “in remission”. I am a medical coder and many charts are documented by providers as patients having their depression be in remission but also must take medication.
It sucks to have to take medication for the rest of your life but it’s worth it if it eases the pain and anguish depression brings.

Can ambient help when Adderall keeps people awake?
Ambien probably would help people sleep but you should definitely speak to your doctor for direction. Both prescriptions are addictive and you should not rely on either medication to function or sleep unless absolutely medically necessary. Adderrall typically causes a calming effect in those who truly have ADHD. Always try natural, over the counter solutions before relying on medication you may need to take for a lifetime.

Wow, your story sounds very similar to my experience. It’s so terrible but it’s a bit comforting to know we aren’t alone. It’s so hard as empaths to try to comprehend how anyone could be so cold, especially someone you believed actually cared for you. I question and over analyze every communication because somehow I’m convinced it’s something that I’ve done. It’s so difficult to get over a friendship when you’re never provided any sort explanation or closure on your terms. Everything is on their terms only.

Can PMS get worse as you get older?
Yes! As a pre-teen my emotional state became cyclic due to PMS which has never changed to this day. Birth control is another factor that can negatively impact all of the symptoms of PMS. Most are hormonal, so it makes sense that they have such an effect. As I’ve gotten older my migraines have definitely increased, which are also cyclical. Then as women approach menopause, many of those monthly complaints are dramatically exacerbated. I have read and heard this can last for years. There are apps now to track PMS symptoms, moods, meds, fertility, ovulation, intimacy and cycle. It’s a great way to track and document pertinent information and analyze it over time.

Can hypothyroidism cause depression, or is it the other way around?
Hypothyroidism can cause depression. Changes in hormone levels definitely effect your mental health.

I wish I could upvote this 100 times, because I think people need to hear this! I agree fully! 12 steps programs do NOT teach us to take accountability for our choices and, even more importantly, TAKE CREDIT for our successes. Passing the credit to a group or “higher power” robs us of the knowledge that WE can do this! WE decide our future, and if we have successful times, no matter how small, WE did that, and we can do it again and again until we learn what it takes for us to be sober. We are NOT powerless!
AA made me think about drinking every time I went when I wouldn’t have when I figured out what worked for ME. A sincere desire to change, and learning by trial and error is what will keep us sober in the long run. It’s often two steps forward and one step back along the way, but as long as we are learning and progressing, that’s the process!

I suffer from this as well. I was told they are called “intrusive thoughts” and can be an indication of OCD. Unfortunately, the only advice is medication and therapy. Choose a therapist who specializes in OCD. That’s your best bet. It probably won’t ever completely go away, but it can get manageable. I sympathize! ❤️

What does anxiety feel like?
Anxiety symptoms can be different for different people. I have generalized anxiety with intrusive thoughts, and occasional panic attacks.
I tried to explain general anxiety to my ex husband and the only thing I could think of at the time was that it felt like I was CONSTANTLY running for my life, running from a bear, and I couldn’t take a deep breath. I was so tired. Soooo tired.

How can you get over the feeling of emptiness, insecurity, and anxiety? Could this mean that the person is heading into depression?
Speaking from personal experience, so many people say that depression and anxiety are two separate issues, but it’s becoming very rare that anyone only experiences one and not the other. Antidepressants in conjunction with therapy has been the most effective thing for me. Please don’t suffer. There is help, and you aren’t alone!

Is it morally wrong to not visit a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer's in a nursing home? What is the point of visiting if they don't remember you, or won't remember you ever visited?
Morals are subjective, so that’s not a simple answer. However, you need to ask yourself if you love this person. Are you willing to make them happier in that moment, even if it doesn’t benefit you. Imagine how lonely it would be to be in their place.
They don’t need to know who you are for your visit to benefit them. The question you need to ask yourself is if you love them enough to selflessly give them a visit that could make them happier in that moment.

Why do people like the series Bob's Burgers?
I have no idea. I’ve suffered through the first few episodes, thinking it must get better since so many people love it, but I guess it’s just not for me. I do snicker here and there, but it’s never the big belly laugh that releases endorphins.
It’s just so “flat” and monotone, strange and bizarre (to be funny, I guess?), and I always end up turning the King of the Hill.
Humor changes with each generation. My grandma tried to sit through some of my favorite shows and thought they were terrible. 🤷🏻‍♀️

This is very interesting. I find those same symptoms occur in my 11 year old son when he plays video games excessively, though. No porn involvement in the slightest. I would really like to see this compared to excessive phone use, t.v. watching, gaming, etc. Also as compared to sex addition. Just curious. Thanks for the info! 🙂

As a preciously EMT licensed person, this is pretty much what I was going to say, too. If you don’t feel well and there’s a significant change in your temperature, go to urgent care or the ER right away.
There ARE emergency situations where someone’s temperature will drop. It’s rare that this happens, but it isn’t impossible. Stay safe!

Why does anxiety hurt when you try to resist it?
Anxiety is your body trying to tell you something is wrong, just like physical pain is. I’ve heard it be said that depression is pain over events of the past, and anxiety is pain concerning future events, whether actual or only perceived.
Anxiety often gets worse if you ignore or resist it. (Think of a child trying to get a parent’s attention.) Instead, trying “leaning in” the anxiety by taking some deep breaths and ask yourself why you’re having anxiety, tell your body that you hear it asking for help and ask what it needs. It will often tell you. This takes practice and patience. Therapy is wonderful for helping you become more in tune to your emotional needs and can do wonders to help. Good luck!

I took my brother’s son into my care a few years ago because he is unstable. I love my nephew but I want to travel the world and live my life. Would it be wrong to put my nephew in foster care for this reason?
Agreeing to take in a child is a promise to that child to be the stability and care that he needs. It would be horribly unfair to put him back into the system. Children who have been put into the system in the first place are scared, insecure, and need reassurance that they are worthy of love and stability. There is more to taking in a child than providing basic needs. Your nephew needs to know that he is wanted and loved. Putting him back into the system because you want to “enjoy your life” sends the message that he prevents people from enjoying life. That’s a horrible message to send anyone, and completely soul crushing to a child.

What do people think about the movie ""A Clockwork Orange""?
My answer to this is pretty short…. while I can see and appreciate the brilliance of the actors, director, and writer…. I still found it to be a lengthy stream of mind-numbing rape and violence that quickly became boring. I kept thinking it would pick up and get better, but was largely disappointed by the end. The horror of it, to me, was that it was so easy for me to become bored and numb of rape and murder. I’m glad I saw it, but won’t torture myself with a second viewing.

Why do I feel the need to wear something nice when I have work with my ex?
Well, I personally like to look my best when seeing an ex because I like to “show them what they’re missing”, and that I’ve moved on and fine without them. I may also feel better if I think I look better than they do because then I can tell myself that I’m too attractive for them anyway. 😂
I think nearly everyone does this, we just don’t like to admit to it. haha

What is manifestation?
Manifestation is a powerful tool that helps you to manifest the life of your dreams. It is based on the law of attraction, which states that like attracts like, and that whatever we focus on will be drawn into our lives. Manifestation is a process of bringing positive thoughts and feelings into reality by visualizing what you want in life and taking inspired action to make it happen. With manifestation, you can create a life full of abundance, joy, and success by focusing on what you want instead of what you don’t have.

If you haven’t asked the question yet (couldn’t find it; I’m not too familiar with navigating on Quora), in my experience it’s completely second nature.
My now ex-spouse showed me my narcissistic patterns, and I never noticed any of them. Making her blame herself for my coldness in the relationship – never saw that. When I would have to confess my lies and stories, I shift the blame because I feel suffocated. I would uphold an elitist atmosphere in our home by demanding success in exchange for love. I would cheat on her with girls that I didn’t find that attractive – they just implied ‘yes’, I didn’t want to pass up the opportunity, and I would lovebomb them; I padded the dates with working ‘till late hours to buy myself time until I accept what I’ve done or to forge a narrative. I would even find myself believing stories only to find out that they were just situations blown out of proportion or one-offs turned into patterns.
There are some narc stories that seem to say the same things – everything, including the lies, seem normal to you. There was this story about a narc-survivor whose abusive ex-husband had given her a book about NPD or BPD, implying he’s the one walking on eggshells. I, as the author probably does too, feel slightly resentful that many victims treat pwNPD as if they were lepers and should be isolated at best. It is indeed hurtful and we (or at least I) wish to change. I know I’m fucked up, I just don’t see in what way.
I tend to think about these toxic ideas as if they were Baudrillard’s simulacra – for me and the ones who don’t know any better (i.e., uneducated victims and pwNPD), hyperreality and reality are impossible to discern, and over time the former makes you distrust the latter. It is nigh impossible to tell when it’s me taking action and when it’s me living a narrative, which I’ll be able to see only retrospectively.
And to all the victims – I recognize the bravely you need to muster up to stand up to a pwNPD. And at the same time – I’m sorry. We can’t help it. Take this to be an explanation, not an excuse.
In short: I’m not consiously evil, toxic, or destructive. I just end up doing all these things because I was not taught or I just forget to care about others. I hope this answer – to all 20 people who will read this – could be useful.

I am in a similar situation. I am dating a lovely man who has bpd. I have read about the condition at length and understand the reasons for it and therefore his limitations so-to-speak. (No offence intended)
I also am not neurotypical. I have zero clue what my problem is, however I suffer from major insecurities and crave validation and a sense of self worth from others (I believe it is due to a lack of strong attachment to my parents as a child and possibly due to trauma from past romantic relationships) I am therefore relying on him to provide said attachment and warmth, love, nurture etc. I get fixated on the fact that he isn’t providing me with what I need and fail to see his needs. He therefore attacks me for not being sensitive to his condition. This then sends me into a spiral of self hatred as I do not like being perceived as a bad person and take his comments as being equivalent to character assassinations. I sincerely do not know what to do about the situation…
all I know is that I love him very much, but I do not know how to show him love in a way that he understands or needs. I feel immensely inept.

What you wrote is beautiful. I can tell he means so much to you.
Cheekily, I would like a bit of advice; I am in a relationship with a pwBPD. They are self aware and are in the beginnings of receiving counselling etc.
I love him dearly and would do anything for him. I am well read in the condition and I fully understand that in order for our relationship to work, a lot of work will have to be put in from both sides. I do not see him as a pwBPD, but as a beautiful individual who has needs, quirks, beautiful characteristics and wants to be loved like we all do. I wish to understand him as much as I possibly can.
The thing is, he has been amazingly supportive of me, as I am going through a difficult time in my life. He has been the consistent, reliable one. I on the other hand, am the flighty, inconsistent, over-emotional, reactive one. I question my own shortcomings as I feel that I am not able to open up fully and I am the one who fears abandonment, I feel like I do not receive the love and affection I want or deserve, I feel regular self loathing and question my worth.
How can I ‘get over’ my own perceived shortcomings and let him in so to speak? I desperately want to but have no clue what is holding me back…

Why do poor people shop at Walmart when they can use their food stamp card on Amazon?
Another good reason is that Amazon is more expensive than shopping at Walmart.for a lot of things even if it's just a small amount.Still if you are disadvantaged and you have to go on EBT/SNAP benefits you want to try to make that money you get go as far as possible.people don't have cash to fall back on because due to this unemployment . EBT alone is not enough to buy food for a whole month. Everyone is trying to get the most for their dollars right now whether it's government-funded or their own.

It’s worth considering that puppies, especially if they are a larger breed, eat more food than you’d expect because they are growing really fast.
Cost depends on the brand of food you get, if your dog is little or big, if you buy kibble or add in things like omega oil, pumpkin purée, etc (consult a vet on what you should/shouldn’t give to your particular dog & what age it’s okay to give it to them) There are also companies that make raw dog food an easier option which can be really good to incorporate even a couple times a week. One that I know of is We Feed Raw.
Also, remember that cheaper doesn’t always mean better. A good quality dog food that cost more will be better in the long run because you can hopefully avoid health problems that require vet visits which are expensive!

If I were you I would ask them one more time. Do it in a situation where they can’t give an excuse to leave suddenly. If they give excuses as to why they are doing these things, kindly persist & let them know you genuinely want to know. Think about if there is anything else going on that you don’t know of that may be causing this
Basically don’t put up with their BS. Try your best to be straightforward.
I agree with the other comments about how it looks like they’re being racist. I am not straight, but I didn’t know that until this year. In middle school & high school most of my friends were not straight, even though I was (or so I thought haha). They didn’t treat me differently solely because I wasn’t queer. They did make certain assumptions about me based on my faith, but the people who get to know me see the real me.
You may need to be vulnerable & say something like “hey, I don’t know what’s going on, but I am trying to communicate with you all. I feel (insert how you feel) when you all (insert the things they do). for example “I feel sad & left out when you run away from me & don’t answer my question about why.”
Ask “If I did something to upset any of you, please tell me so I can do better moving forward. I enjoy being friends with you & don’t want to lose our friendship.”
If you firmly but kindly ask them again (& show them respect while communicating) but they still give excuses or otherwise avoid answering the question, perhaps they are not good friends. If you are confident that it’s not something you did to upset them (intentionally or by accident) I think they are just being crappy & you don’t deserve to be treated like that.
It’s hard to give advice not knowing the people, and yourself, but I hope this at least helps a little bit.

thank you:) you seem very wise & genuine with your responses.
as far as physical touch goes, autism affects us similarly. I am a bit more sensitive to a larger variety of things than she is, and she is particularly sensitive to new sensations which includes/included all romantic things that are generally a part of relationships. That’s true for both of us. Neither of us are “typical” as far as what people seem to think of teenagers, which we are totally okay with.
It’s most likely something I just need to continue processing on my own, but I am unsure of whether or not I have a desire to think about sex… It could be societal pressure & expectations or “norms” for teenagers my age, it could be another way I feel “left out” and different so my brain resorts to analyzing everything in high detail to make sense of it.
This seems like one of the things that “only time (and experience) will tell” for sure. That’s okay, it’s not something that will be unmanageable to leave unknown. That need for clarity & answers is one of my autistic traits lol.
Usually it helps to just talk about things with strangers without fear of judgement, you know?
Thank you for your input!

the thing is, I don’t want to have sex. Neither does my girlfriend. She feels similarly (talking about sex makes us both anxious/uncomfortable/grossed out). even if I did want to experience sex relatively soon, I would respect her feelings & choices.
It might be worth noting that we are both autistic. I say that because the sensory aspects of being physically intimate can easily become overwhelming & uncomfortable for both of us, along with uncertainty & so many new things.
We do cuddle/snuggle a lot and kiss. We don’t technically “make out” (by that I mean the “heavy petting” & touching parts) but for us making out looks like kissing for longer time blocks & more intensely than typical moments.
I think that perhaps I think about things, not necessarily because I want to have sex, but because the level of intimacy & vulnerability is fascinating & desirable to me.

I’m a 17 (almost 18) year old female. I don’t want to have sex & thinking about it makes me anxious/uncomfortable, but I still think about it a lot & have so many curiosities. Is this common? (I do have a girlfriend) Perhaps it’s the intimacy I want?

main question/point (the rest is rambling & context): a question for anyone who is out, I guess? To anyone who is able to safely do this, will you tell me about what it’s like to show affection (physical or not) in public places? or just in general? like being able to really relax in the loving moments & fully take it in?
My best friend who is also my girlfriend (of almost 4 months!) is absolutely amazing & I will tell anyone who is safe & trustworthy about her. Like I BEAM when I get to talk about her or talk with her or just look at her🥺☺️ My family is not accepting at all so anywhere that I don’t have to pretend to be straight is a breath of fresh air.
I just want to vicariously experience the feelings of holding hands in public & not thinking about whispering when I say “babe” or “my love” in public & looking around us to check for people before & when we kiss. WHATS IS IT LIKE?!? I bet it’s amazing.
We are both 17F & turn 18 this year. So it’s awkward if we like KISS kiss when her mom or dad is in the next room, ya know? that’s probably a common expected experience though lol
At her house we have significantly more freedom (we can cuddle & I can give her a billion hugs & we can BE OURSELVES & I ask for kisses all the time & *make psychical contact beyond what is expected for a typical friend 😒🙄*, etc) & can actually call each other girlfriend or “love/babe”.
One time we held hands for like 1 minute in a grocery store & it was liberating honestly🥰😂 & we had a date in a park & it was nice to hold hands & kiss (even though it was very sneaky & discrete).
*reading that last paragraph it sounds really clingy & obsessive, but I promise it’s not. it’s mutual (the physical affection). she is my main safe person emotionally & for touch so I fullfill my need for loving physical contact through her lol but we constantly check in with each other. I just don’t want that to come off as clingy or unhealthy.
I didn’t know if I should put this here or in a general LGBT reddit chat, so I just went with this. I consider myself a lesbian. I also use the term queer. Surprisingly, I’m not too worried about figuring it out. Neither is my girlfriend. I understand that sexuality is fluid so saying I’m a lesbian now does not mean I can never change that if I learn or experience something new. I could be bi, but who the heck knows? just wanted to say that:)
PLEASE I am inviting you to brag about your girlfriends/partners!! I am excited for the days when we won’t need to look both ways before we kiss like we’re crossing a road or something 🥲🥺
ps. you are all loved & valid & beautiful!! happy pride month!!!🏳️‍🌈✨💛🤟🏻 If you are not able to be fully out or are choosing not to be, I see you & you’re not alone. You are just as valid.

Why do people refer to dogs as ""it""? Wouldn't it be better to refer to a dog as ""he"" or ""she""?
I don’t recall knowing anyone who refers to a dog or other pet that they are familiar with (belongs to them, a friend, or they have met before) as an “it”. However, if someone is referring to a random dog in public that they don’t know, it is common for people to say “it”. Examples: “It’s so cute! Look at that dog, It’s so big! It’s fur has beautiful markings!” I love dogs so much. Like I’m obsessed. I love all animals too, but dogs & pets especially. So personally it feels strange to me to call a dog or pet “it”, despite the fact that it’s the typical term used among humans. I refer to non-living inanimate things as “it” like clothes, toys, food, etc. Because it’s so common, I have said “it” most of my life, but it never felt quite right. Now, I usually use “they/them/theirs” when I talk about…

Is there a better way to say ""are you okay?"" to someone who you know is not okay?
Instead of “are you okay?” you can ask “how are you doing today/now/in this moment?” While there nothing inherently wrong with asking “are you okay?”, it can unintentionally communicate this underlying message that there’s an expectation to be okay all the time. Does that make sense? Also, I added the “today/now/in this moment” part because personally when I am asked how I am, I can only really say how I am in the moment. Maybe within that hour or the past few hours. I’m not exactly sure what you may be asking someone about… whether it’s a mental health thing, physical health, or a circumstance. However, for myself and many others, those things (how we are mentally/physically/or the state of a difficult situation we are in) can change often & possibly drastically. So asking about that present…

Has anyone had any real encounter with paranormal activity or seemingly something ghostly or otherworldly?
I shared a room with…
As this was summer time and we had put on liquid electric mosquito repellent and there was a little red beam of light projected from it which was enabling me to see the figure of my sister. I thought she wanted to use rest room but instead she stood there and started giggling softly. She stood there for like two minutes. Her provoking laugh made me furious. That giggle made me so furious and took my blood to the boiling point. It felt like she wanted me to shout at her or start quarrelling. If not, why would she be in position to open the door lock but won’t and giggle? Being furious by that act, I was about to yell at her then then an oozing; creepy chill ran down my spine as I saw both of my sisters sleeping on the bed next to mine. But, when I turned my head to see who that person at door could be, there was no one. It didn’t take long for me to decide who that was at the door.

I shared a room with my two other sisters, one younger and the other elder who was of mischievous characters (you know who plays tricks/pranks and makes your life harder than it already is in a funny way). We had two beds placed side by side next to each other near a window in our room. My younger sister used to sleep with my elder sister in a bed and I used to sleep alone in the other. So, that particular night, I was asleep and suddenly I felt someone dragged/pulled my blanket all down to the floor. Who wouldn’t woke up after you feel the discomfort, I did too and woke up and thought it was my elder sister. She used to play lots of trick/pranks on me and this was the first of this kind.

What is the best movie you have ever seen? What's a movie you've seen many times but you know you'll see it again in the future?
The best film that i have ever seen was A Crazy Little Thing Called Love. It came from Thailand. It tells about a girl who liked a handsome boy in her school. But she kept her feeling and not tell the boy that she likes him. I loved this film so much because Mario Maurer was playing as the boy in this film, omg he is so handsome ><

Blunt(s)? As in more than one? How much did you smoke? If it was laced with anything and you aren’t used to doing drugs, it has you paranoid and sketched out. Also, you are young and you dont know this yet but, there are weird people in this world. They say and do strange things. This guy was one of those people. You are over-thinking this, probably due to the drugs AND lack of sleep. You don’t need to worry and hang on his every word or some book. Forget him, move on. Learn from this and never put yourself in a situation like that again.

What's the difference between obese and morbidly obese?
“Obese” is overweight. “Morbidly obese” is so overweight, that is constitutes a threat to your life.
There are charts that show what the actual numbers are. i.e. how heavy and what % body fat constitutes “obesity”, “morbid obesity” and “super morbid obesity”.

We might think that eating sugary, fatty foods is a problem. But sometimes it can be a solution. I’ll explain why it might not be a problem, in a minute. But first, we need to recognise we are living in the space-age inside our stone-age bodies. Every since we lived in caves, our minds and bodies have been programmed to find food, and to find as much of it as quickly, easily and safely as possible. Sugary, fatty foods provide the most calories, in the smallest possible space, so they give you the calories you body craves (and needs) very quickly. The cave men/women that achieved this, lived longer, had more cave-babies and we are their descendants. That desire for the most, fastest, easiest calories, is hardwired into our biology. Unfortunately, because sugary, fatty foods are so calorie dense…

Because they are the only ones that are “fat shamed”. Slim people don’t face those sorts of prejudice, so don’t need a movement to help counteract “thin shaming”. It’s like the reason why there is a “Black Lives Matter” movement, and not a “White Lives Matter” movement (when logically, all lives matter). Because it’s only the black lives that are being treated unfairly, only the black lives need a movement to counteract their unjust treatment. So people who are fat, need a movement to counteract their unwelcomed treatment. For the record, all the evidence points to two undeniable facts: 1. Being overweight increases the risks of disease and a shorter life. 2. Making overweight people feel bad about their weight doesn’t make them lose weight or get any thinner. It just makes them feel bad. As most peo…

My idea of a Christmas movie would have to have A family (doesn’t have to be typical), pets, friends, food, strong devotion of love towards each other , decorations and reflections of Jesus. Maybe not in that order. I personally like Jewish humor… any type of debical would work with those elements.

it’s still a fairer society than one where a man is held liable for children that aren’t his. Let the mother name the real father and let them pay paternity instead. It’s also entirely avoidable if the women involved don’t cheat on their partners.

Hate to tell you, but Othello wasn’t real. And since loads of white fictional characters are now race-swapped for black actors, this seems a doubly-strange argument to make.
So, a false equivalency. A real equivalency would be white people trying to claim that Genghis Khan was white, but you know, they never have.

Is it possible for individuals with autism to love themselves? If so, what are some ways they can practice self-love?
the term Love is so inadequate sometimes . In English, it's the same word used to describe how you feel about a romantic partner, a parent, sibling or best friend. I love my cat, and I also love my mom but I know and most people realize that the love I have for my mom is not the same as for my cat. those nuances in language and context mean that we actually fill in the meaning blanks in our brains based on experience and culture. the autistic experience with meanings the interpretation of words and information tends to the literal and I find that I need pretty concrete terms and definitions in order to make meaning or interpret it. would you say that you have a family member that you love? have you had a relationship and been in love maybe? a best friend? loving someone isnt necessarily going…

What is the best way to expose a narcissist?
it's not worth the effort. it's best to grey rock them and go no contact so they have no access to you as supply. the validation from exposing a narcissist is not the juicy resolution and closure that we victims crave. we're always denied closure from them as well. if you experienced a narcissist, you probably experienced the lies, mental warfare, gaslighting and all the confusion and doubt that caused you. their entire life is built like that , all of their relationships and interactions are built from similar garbage with the purpose of protecting their narcissistic ego. if you begin to peel any of that away, they'll likely go 110% on a smear campaign about you in retaliation. you may also cause them narcissistic injury in exposing them to others and that is extremely dangerous. a narcissitic…

have you been using consistently for a long period of time? it doesn't even have to be that long 6 weeks maybe. have you had a tolerance break?
meth floods your brain with dopamine and that's why it feels good and that's the high. it doesn't supply the dopamine tho, it triggers a huge release of it from our body and over time our supply gets depleted and not replenished properly.
this also means that the more you use and the longer you use for, the less high you can possibly get. your returns will always diminish.

you first. what's your opinion?
are you questioning a person's self diagnosis or do you think you are autistic and want to find out how ok it is to do that?
it's ok to do that. to identify this in yourself means that you can betin to identify ways in which you've lacked accommodations and learn how to ask for them from others (work, friends, family) and also provide them to yourself. this could be as simple as getting some loop ear plugs.
once you start doing this, you can reframe a lot of things about yourself and who you are and what you need
by and large, the autistic community validates self diagnosis. I think this is largely because a person who has self diagnosed with autism has done 100s of hours of research, testing and analysis of themselves. I think it's like 90+% of people who self diagnose and then get assessed by a specialist are actually autistic.
I hope this helps

I recently got a customer service job in retail. I am autistic. Any advice from fellow autistic folks on surviving a customer service gig?
Late diagnosed AuDHD here. was in sales and service for 25 years. here is what I've learned: you have the potential to be better at this job than anyone else. here's why: number one. our unique experience with empathy. if your role is on the phone or via emails/chat, this is definitely somewhere you can excel. here's what to remember. you don't have to physically feel how the customer feels you can mentally know what you would need to know if you were them or what you'd expect if you were them. so this is where attention to detail and pattern recognition will be your best friend. so there's never too much information there's never enough information it's something that we all really enjoy. just take that desire for the details and kind of make it as concise as you can in gathering information f…

what would happen if those alters are always suppressed? my ex would fall asleep and everyone else would wake up and it was chaos. often, a co-him (there were 3–4 versions of him that he'd rotate, they were all narcissistic and his mom told me much later that he was diagnosed as ODD and she mentioned aspd but not In those terms because in 1990, aspd wasn't used as terminology)
so, one of HIM would regale everyone with tales of success and fucking women and making plans to make money and blah blah. I observed this many times and it struck me that often, he was addressing siblings. he was an only child and had no siblings. his dad had sever muscular dystrophy and was wheelchair bound. I also witnessed the severe gas lighting his dad would levy onto m my ex’s mother . father and son would sit and laugh about doing things like flipping the breaker to her electric piano so she thought it broke because they didn't want to listen. (earphones would have done the same thing, but if you're a narc or psychopath it's much more enjoyable to watch someone suffer while you get what you want).
there was “the asshole” who seemed to be his internal antagonist who I had met. if I was unsure (because this alter would SA me and trafficking me and noI wanted to be able to quickly identify him) could not read or write. the story I got was that this person was hundreds of years old and actively tried to destroy other alters and was more chaotic than any of the other alters.
there was Pierre. someone who I think was a version of a person who did actual harm to him outside of his immediate family. Pierre was complicated - he spoke french, was often in drag and was (confusingly) a protector and also an alter who would emerge just to leave the main hims in dangerous situations and often far from home. this is something that would be mirrored in my own experiences with my ex. I met Pierre a few times and only when main ex was sleeping.
often, he'd speak in totally different registers and the main hims would never fake a voice that was a more falsetto or higher in the chest and larynx. they were all too full of themselves and their fragile egos to do that. they actually (the main 4) with an almost forced deepness and fake masculinity. the slightly falsetto voice came from the only alter I met who could experience empathy and connection. I met him 3 times. all 3 were accidents that he came out. normally, he was totally suppressed (kept in the basement) and eventually the asshole was actively trying to kill him. he was younger than the others by about 10myears and they called him. the virgin. I heard this falsetto voice first when my ex was talking to his ex on the phone. I later found out that this alter was the only one who was in a relationship with her and when things started to deteriorate, he was locked up and the others began warfare against her. I like him. I spent some time with him and also received phone calls from him in terror because asshole was going to kill him.
I found it strange that the other alters were afraid and on high alert but not aware that for asshole to kill virgin it would be their only source of how to appear even a little normal. or maybe asshole knew he'd have to kill the body. he was aware that he was part of a system. then I witnessed the conversations and alters when he'd finally fall asleep. it was so loud I was nearly evicted and I'd often be harassed and kept awake by them.
he would destroy my belongings and he broke my television and other tech. usually as bike Mike who would talk as a motorcycle. sometimes just numbers being babbled. bike Mike was totally aware of what he was doing but his behind his speech differences.
one alter spoke in his dad's voice and it also could not walk and would drag itself around by one leg. his dad was also wheelchair bound like I said. they called this person “brain guy” because he knew what happened to original boy ex and called the major shots.
mostly, there were 4 of him which he'd switch up. a violent asshole and like 4 times the virgin who would come out as fully conscious and aware and interact.the others were complete chaos and I found out later that he had never acknowledged them to anyone but his inner him because he was diagnosed as ODD and sociopathic as a kid and didn't want to be flagged with this as a diagnosis as well. could be a lie . but flagged for what? why is that threatening. well, because he not only was capable of doing serious harm or unaliving, he HAD and he liked it. being flagged or having his alters documented meant that he could end up on the radar during investigations. not because he was nervous of being judged or medicated. so…chaos.
so I just observed and took notes and listened. any switches that happened that I witnessed were done because he thought I was out of earshot or couldn't see or just wasn't paying attention to small details. sometimes he'd say “switch” and shake his head, especially if he had been using drugs and had to speak to his parents or something.
and then I saw the whole crew when none of the main hims could keep a lid of things because they were exhausted. and I listened. and watched.
casually one day, I was looking at him and I said “you know what? you can look like 4 completely different people” I didn't say it to ruffle feathers or anything. I'm autistic and was commenting on my experience of his look and presence. anyways. he looked terrified.
after a weekend of him getting high and drugging and selling me, the exhaustion broke his control and I met the virgin. I wasn't shocked or scared and we talked for hours and he told me my exes origin story. it sounded like a story a kid made up and it was extremely detailed. it's not like he was faking this and telling me bullshit. virgin believed this completely and because his experience was mainly internal, he had not seen it disproved. in the middle of virgin and I kissing (this alter was about 26), asshole came out and began laughing at me and told me that the virgin wouldn't be seen again and then he let me ask questions.
and I did. and I told him what I had observed and what I figured was going on.
are you all you or different? at first, I was told they were all him and that they all could see everything and talk. this didn't feel true then, he also didn't know what I had seen and who I had spoken to.
who are the twins? these were the siblings I mentioned and they were like bratty yes men. moody. they were also him apparently but I later found out that they were terribly neglected alters he only ever lied to and they were kept locked up unless they were out to validate bullshit.
dad and dad's voice. the alter coming forward and being visible only happened a few times but dad's voice would always be loud and telling everyone how it was but only during those sleep messed up times.
the main hims. I told him I new he switched out selves and I was aware of 4 for sure . there were 5 and that 5th was eventually sent to the basement because we became close and he wasn't abusing me and satisfying the others
every one who fronted had different handwriting, different clothing they preferred and slightly varied cadence and register when they spoke
after Ithis conversation, he told me that nobody ever had asked that or had seen it as anything other than night terrors and inconsistent behavior which he passed off as a part of his drug addiction.
he did go to rehab and I was baffled. I asked him, you're all in the body which is physically addicted and there are several of you who front and use your brain for being in the physical. how will the therapy work? (I found out that often , the main hims were not watching everything going on outside) how will all of you know the information? he wouldn't explain. because later I found out that he mainly went to commit insurance fraud and also use other residents as supply for his need to feed on their pain.
so, was all of him (except virgin) a type of psychopathic personality? the result of a psychopathic alter trying to control and keeps lid of things?
he'd kill animals and had since young, he decided when 12 that his role was villain because he knew he wasn't the same as others and didn't feel emotions or regret or shame. 3 of his ex girlfriends are dead. 1 suicide (which I think isn't what happened based on inconsistencies in details and things he's said) and 2 overdoses . all the others ended up addicts. so did I. he would take apart my blood glucose testers so I couldn't test my sugar. he'd take my insulin. he'd hold me down Nd inject me with what was very nearly overdose amounts to “watch me be afraid and then my eyes fade” . then he'd sell me online.
he's dead now. he was terrified leading up to his death - he had congestive heart failure and knew it was coming. he was terrified of dying because he knew he was evil.
(also confessed unaliving of ppl to me while high and scared and that he was an arm's dealer. I knew about the weapons because who buys and sells vehicles every week with cash from the next province and drives them to border towns and his bff was a known one)
I will be in therapy for a long time. I want to be clear that I know that people with disability of disorders are not all sexism I would say the numbers the same everybody else. I guess what I'm getting out of that his sister was so difficult and locked down and never had been even extra support by him he was just somebody you trying to maintain that I think helped to create
the monster he was

Why does pineapple on pizza taste so great?
Assuming that it doe…
The reason why it may not be the case at all is that the taste of the fruit may overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. For example, people will tell you not to eat pizza with pineapple because pineapple coats your tongue and prevent you from experiencing the natural sweetness of the tomato. Salt from the pepperoni, say you are having a pepperoni pizza, brings out the taste of the tomato but salt also enhances the taste of the pineapple. When this happens, you will just taste the pineapple and just feel the texture of the sauce but not the taste.sauce.¶

Addendum: However, if you like how pineapple tastes on a Hawaiian pizza, you are most welcome to consider it great.

How about you discuss your “utter” fear of him going to a “deadly sleepover” instead of forcing him inside and making him eligible to rebelling? Why can’t parents just communicate with their children.
Just because you were denied freedom in your early years doesn’t give you the right to bully your children.

Will Morrow, the title of the video is “In Plane Sight”, was originally over an hour long back in 2010. It did not push any view but instead encouraged the viewers to ask themselves questions and to think for themselves. I woke up that day and my eyes were opened. Now if someone wants to see that same video on YouTube, it comes up but it’s only six minutes long if it’s the same video I’m talking about they have literally removed the entire continent leaving only the introduction where he talks about conspiracy theories, and his conclusion at the end. Now why is that?
some of the questions he post in the video that I can remember are if you can go to a basketball game and watch any play backwards, forwards, in slow motion, then why can’t we see a plane actually crashing into the worlds most protected building which has 16 cameras on each side?
Why is the hole in the pentagon not wide enough To accommodate a plane that size? Why is there no wreckage? If the wreckage was disintegrated by jet fuel, then why is there a book left open on the podium that you can see through the gaping hole, not disintegrated in the heat? The same heat that supposedly bent the steel girders on the wtc towers? Kind of crazy how all the first responders who were there that day and the weeks following have mostly all died due to cancer and other illnesses? The people got sick because of the little ball nuclear bombs that they planted in the building I don’t know exactly what they’re called but they’re like little balls of nuclear detonation that brought it down the way it did.
Overall the video encouraged viewers over and over to ask questions and think for themselves. Humans by nature are like sheep they follow the herd.
sad how it’s not there anymore so other people can begin to think it . truly was one of the best videos I’ve ever seen. I can’t even say that the information is out there because there are entities that I’ve worked so hard to keep it from the public this video being edited severely is a great example of censorship. I apologize for my punctuation errors my phone is giving me real difficulty with typing this response. I hope it makes sense.

“Some people actively evade being precise” i love how that phrase pinpoints what has been a source of frustration for me over the years in dealing with certain personality types. Before the collective awareness and information the internet brought to light, i assume most people, like myself, when dealing with a narc or similar personality type would scratch their head and wonder what the problem was with the other person. I was always thinking something was wrong with them and i just “couldnt put my finger on it “. Had i known then what i know now …..

For some reason your story struck a chord with me, and I found the tears flowing by the time I was done reading, and tears don’t come easy to me most of the time. None of us have the time we think we do while we are here; life can be painfully short. Thank you for sharing, may it be a reminder to all of us to not take life for granted.

What does it mean when someone cries but won't tell why they're crying and just says ""it's nothing""?
Maybe four reasons: 1. They genuinely don’t know why they’re crying. They are unaware of the reason and would need help figuring it out. 2. They know the reason why but just not ready or not comfortable enough to tell you. If you are close, sometimes it’s not that they don’t trust you but they probably just need more time to gather their thoughts and emotions. 3. They know the reason but they don’t feel like you are safe to tell it to. They want to be able to trust you first before saying anything because the reason is probably very sensitive to them. 4. They know the reason but “It’s nothing” has been their go-to response after multiple times of invalidation and they feel like it doesn’t matter anymore or not wanting to be a burden instead. Low self-worth. This is the saddest reason for me. Imo, they nee…

Is it normal to cry every night?
Do you know the reason why you cry every night? It could be weighing down on you and needs to be let out. Else, it gets repressed to the point you won’t even know why you’re crying. It could also be a sign of depression. I suggest you talk to a counselor or a therapist to figure things out. I wish you best of health!

I've been waiting over a year now for child support to start…he still hasn't even gone in for the genetic confirmation thing since he isn't on my daughter's birth certificate. but of course on Christmas, he texts me asking if him and his girlfriend can have the kids overnight Christmas Eve and he will bring them back Christmas day in the afternoon. I was literally at a loss for words. Why???! So you can take pictures of them opening presents your girlfriend bought I'm sure but you will take credit for and post them all over Facebook and send them to your parents and use my kids to play house during the time of both days you know that we do presents with my family and then Santa's present Christmas morning are you effing kidding me?!

Unless you did something during your stay to get another charge , like if you tried to escape, that's up to 7 more years you could potentially get added to your original sentence if they charge you with escape. Or if you kill someone, or even get caught with drugs, or assault a C.O. basically anything that will get you arrested normally you can still be charged with and have a consecutive sentence to serve once the original one is technically complete.

Which is worse, schizophrenia or coronavirus?
schizophrenia, in my personal opinion. corona virus is awful and taking older people’s lives very quick but schizophrenia is a long term thing- people suffer with this for years and it kills them physically and mentally over many years. just my opinion :)

I am 17 years old and my parents are asking me to get married to a girl who is 17 too, but I think this is too early because I don't even have a job. What should I do?
Follow your gut. I can’t tell you how many times I didn’t and regret it to this day, including when my mother wanted me to marry at twenty for her own religious reasons. Biggest mistake of my life!!! You are young but you are smart. Seventeen is far too young. You don’t even know yourself yet!!! Give yourself time to mature and grow, and enjoy the process of “becoming.” This should be a time of youthful fun, exploration, and reflection on your future;where your going, who you want to be, how to get there. What are your passions Ect. Marriage requires a great deal of responsibility. You deserve to enjoy the journey that growing up is, without ANYONE pressuring you for whatever reason to take such a serious step so very soon. It is completely non-sensible. Growing up in and of itself is hard…

Why do my parents like me when I am successful but ignore my problem? My family is the definition of dysfunctional, and I am a successful one so they ignore me even more.
cont. I have the best grades in my family (I was a straight-A student in high school and on the dean’s list currently in uni), everyone vouches for my character and manners, and I am the best child to my mom. Yet, I am always ignored and only there for when they want someone to hear their problems or do something for them. No one even tries to listen to how I feel or think, everything I say or do is quickly shutdown. It makes me feel alienated in my own home, so I just keep to myself, which gets me bullied by them even more. My father was my best friend but I never talk to him anymore because he’s as awful as the rest. My mother is great, but she treats my depression as nothing and tells me to get over myself and to just think “happy thoughts”. I can't talk to my friends because they don't un…

How does being in nature help depression?
It does help tremendously with depression…something about getting close to nature…can feel layers of anxiety just falling off yourself and getting close to God or your spirituality. Try to be in nature as much as you can and you will feel yourself beginning to heal and you’ll get those goosebumpy tingling all throughout your body. It’s really a form of self meditation and self healing. Try it you’ll like it, and it’s free! Take care.

Last point I would add is that, in my opinion, many terfs like JK Rowling seem to be incredibly defensive, fighting for the struggles and strength of their own cis feminist journey not to be “taken from them.” They seem to see trans activism not as a sister movement of similarly disenfranchised people finally being able to breathe and live more safely but as just another “entitled” group, seeking to speak over women’s issues. In truth of course, trans people are usually just speaking up for themselves. This speaks so much to what Kaylyn Holmes (Rowan Holmes) said about JK Rowling seeming to see trans women as “men” trying to have ugly, insidious power over women, and trans men as “women,” suffering from familiar internalized misogyny and a desperation to escape. People like Rowling seem to believe that it’s much more likely that misogyny is the cause of it all than that trans women are women and trans men just are men. People like her feel so defensively protective of their own feminist work and life experience that they seek to protect their own truth over ever working to see others’ as well. People like Blaire White seem to have it in their head that there are a few “good” trans people out there, “real” trans people. But most trans people are simply not believed by people like JK Rowling. Rowling, of course, as a straight, cis woman, knows what they’re really dealing with. When talking about trans people of all genders, Rowling constantly talks about her own experience as a feminist, as a women. But J K Rowling is a cis woman, not a trans person, not a trans scholar. The fact of the matter is that people like Rowling and Scarcella constantly act defensive, attacked, and fundamentally responsible for being involved in this fight, as if it is as relevant to them as anything else. Whether it really is their damn business or not is a whole nother matter entirely :) The main problem here though, is that they definitely seem to think it is.

Why are there so many transphobic feminists?
It’s definitely an interesting and uncomfortable question! I would say it seems that transphobic feminists believe that the “agenda” of the trans community is in direct opposition to their feminist work. This often comes with phrases such as “trans people are trying to ERASE womanhood” or “rapid-onset gender dysphoria is a young girls’ issue therefore a feminist issue we should all be worried about” or something else about “mEn in the wOmEn’s bathroom.” I’m absolutely not saying that I agree with the popular TERF standpoint, but I am saying that the fact that most of these activists seem to think of trans issues as an attack against them, as a relevant women’s issue that they have the responsibility to fight against and be worried about, explains a lot about how the argument “why do you ci…

(*Ariella Scarcella* *JK Rowling*) They care because this feels like a relevant fight for them, and I think that if we want to come to a healthy constructive agreement, we’re going to have to find a new angle one day ://

Exactly!! Saying that he has a seemingly easy life is invalidating his emotions and his experiences. Truth is, we will never know what it is like to be someone else, though we think we could imagine. Everyone is entitled to their emotions and everybody suffers!! I believe comparison is not beneficial, and those who does so, especially to themselves, could realize the harmful effects on one’s mental health. It could hinder one’s healing journey and not allow oneself to accept their experiences and suffering.

#1 I personally don’t think it is ever fair to assume anyone’s life experience as we will never truly know anyone. As someone majoring in Psychology, I believe doing so can invalidate and undermine one’s experience which might be harmful to other’s mental health. For example, if I was to assume that your life is easy and problem-free, it would be unfair for me to do so as I do not know you. Even if I did know you, assuming so might hinder your healing process and allow you to not accept your experiences. If you could consider his work as a reflection of parts of him, maybe you could see it differently. If you could break the barrier of assumptions, maybe you can gain a new perspective. If you can validate his sadness as sadness, you could maybe understand him better. I actually find beauty on the poetry aspects of his songs and I appreciate the appeal of the wordplay as it is not easy to write lyrics, let alone one that can transcend to many people. I guess what I’m trying to say is that even the seemingly privileged people are entitled to their feelings and experiences. Life is not easy for everyone and if we stop comparing each other’s experiences and rather, sees it for what it is and help each other, it would be more productive.
#2 It is your opinion, that is fair but please do refrain from insults that are often offered as a criticism such as “annoying”. Sometimes it might be better to let yourself sit in those emotions, even negative ones, and let go of them when you’re ready. To me, moonchild helps me sit in those emotions and fight my natural instinct to push them away. I guess it isn’t a song to listen to daily if you’re not into songs with that vibe. I do miss his “old” raps, though I believe his 2015 mixtape contains so much anger that if he doesn’t produce similar tracks due to him no longer holding that anger, I would be okay.
#3 I would recommend listening to Intro: Persona! it is definitely more upbeat and more similar to his older vibes. I do think that the “mopey poetry stuff” is a part of him that he can’t convey through bts’s songs. I do believe it is his way of catharsis and a symbol of his emotions at that phase of his life, which could explain your point on the vibe being the same. Again, I do think if you could see his songs as his raw emotions and his actual experience, it might give you another perspective. I’m here not to invalidate your points, rather trying to convince you to see from another light.

I can assure you, “Penalizing” any patient is not the answer to any of this. ALTHOUGH, perhaps re-labeling the correct buildings may be easier than creating another policy/obstacle for patients to adhere to, which ultimately will do nothing but cause more confusion and neglect for the patient.
-Urgent Care- Coughs, colds, scrapes, bumps and infections.
Terminal Care- Breaks, concussions, Heart issues, organ failures, etc…
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure all this out. Think simpler, not more complicated.

Im 20 years old, sometime I get a single irregular heart beat and feel normal again, I'm worried, is that normal?
It's always safe when experiencing these symptoms to goto your primary care physician and have him/her perform an EKG, just to make sure everything is O.K. Always take these kind of symptoms seriously though, and let them know of any dizziness or chest discomfort you might be having as well.

Though it may be true that half of Americans love their guns. It really doesn't prove anything that the second amendment should be just cast aside based on gun ownership?
In addition, it still is factual that our constitution has lasted well over 200 years and that at least 60% of Americans still support it today.

Why do parents whose children pass away keep their bedrooms untouched? Is that even a healthy way to cope?
After my son died I was too grief-stricken to set foot in his room without falling apart emotionally. It was just so overwhelming. Eventually, after about a year, a friend of his offered to go in & clean it up (it was a mess) for me. I still didn't like going in there though & moved a short time later.

Is it right for parents to look through their 15-year-old’s diary just because they want to?
No! My mother read my diary when I was about 17…after reading that my boyfriend & I had been making out & stripped down to our underwear one time (I was still a virgin) she & my dad called me into the living room & berated me calling me a slut & a huge “disappointment.” Then my dad called my boyfriend & embarassed him by telling him what they read in my diary….& forbid us from seeing each other again. I was so angry, confused & humiliated. Looking back on it now, 45 yrs later, I think the worst thing is my folks never just sat & talked to me about sex or birth control…instead they just made me feel like a terrible person which I internalized & I believe led to years of depression & relationship problems for me.

Thank you. Cause here in asia, in our culture, most not all men my age doesnt really respect women, they treat them as objects and would pay their way through everything. Even when married already, would still go to nightclubs and go to events with prostitutes and i wouldnt want to raise that kind of son, because we are in a community with rich men who are like that.

Hi Jim, I never count my words for the day. I simply write until I feel done. However, everyone is different. A good friend of mine says getting to a certain word count keeps her going and helps her keep deadlines to get her novels out on time. I think everyone has a different writing process that fits them.

Has anyone noticed a health related issue common with meth users, particularly swelling of feet ankles and calves? And more so females?
I have noticed. The longer ive used, the worse it becomes. Pretty sure it had to do wth vasoconstriction caused by the methamphetamine. Our vessels constrict during use, they become smaller but the blood flows thru quicker, after awhile those vessel walls weaken. As they do this the blood doesnt pump tbru at the same steady rate thereby causing fluid to accumulate in our lower extremities, the area furthered away from our hearts. Those vessel walls aroubd our heart are weakening also wth continued or prolonged use. I suggest quitting but if not, wearing Ted hose, follow directions on pkg when u buy. Usually 6 hrs on then 6 hrs off. They make them to look like regular socks now so the panty hose look is dated and out, or they're white hose, the best ones. Hope it helps, keep track of ur blo…

I can’t really speak for older people, but for youths with mental illnesses, illnesses/family issues, help can be extremely hard to find in Singapore. From my personal experience, it was very hard, as a student with untreated mental conditions and no parental support, to find the help I needed. I tried many things: contacting government organizations, approaching my school, getting myself therapy sessions with student subsidy (still too expensive to be sustainable), and even attempting to administer CBT on myself. It was especially difficult acting without my parents as there was the issue of money and there were many systemic obstacles I faced as Singaporean youths have very little autonomy to pursue healthcare decisions without parental approval. I can imagine it could only be worse for people in worse situations than me (ie. domestic abuse). Only when I got warded did I get taken seriously by both my family and the health system.

What is Singapore's biggest flaw, in your opinion?
I am only 17, turning 18 this year, so I might I’m not have as much experience as others here, an adult, but I’ve got lots to share anyway, from the perspective of a Singaporean youth.¶

my own perspective.¶

I’m currently studying in what most Singaporeans may consider a “top school”, doing the IB program. I’m also from the upper middle upper/middle class (with overprotective parents), parents) and thus led a very sheltered life because I rarely got to mix around with kids people from different backgrounds. However, I recently got involuntarily admitted into IMH’s psychiatric ward (the child (child ward) for suicide attempts and a history of depressive episodes, reasons I won’t share, due to immense stress from studies among other things and it was an eye-opening experience, to say the least. experience. So let me I’ll share my perspective as a privileged Singaporean youth suffering from struggling with mental illness.
1. The Education Sys…
Singapore’s education system is often seen as a stellar model that people of other countries are always trying to learn from. Our students seem to always do so well, compared to the rest of the world. Apparently, we are the country with the biggest number of top scorers in the IB program (not sure about A levels though). But there are alot of problems and ugliness behind the scenes in Singaporean schools.
I don’t have exact numbers or statistics, but I can say for a fact that many Singaporean kids are suffering as a result of the toxic competitiveness rampant among parents, schools and the entire education system as well as the pressure to do well for exams. It isn’t uncommon to find Singaporean students struggling with clinical depression, anxiety, self harm and suicidal thoughts as a result of stress and studies, especially in the more elite schools. There are even cases of students killing themselves over grades. My own brother (who studied in one of the top JCs) killed himself two years ago, partly due to the pressure from my parents to do well. During my time in the ward, I met at least 4 kids from top secondary schools and JCs who either attempted suicide or seriously self harmed as a result of school stress. This probably isn’t surprising for many Singaporeans, but most of these cases rarely reach the media, or even anybody from outside the schools, because the school management/government bodies are very tight lipped about things like this. Which leads me to my next point.
2. Treatment of people with mental illness
I can’t really speak for older people (ie. people of working age and the elderly), but for youths with mental illnesses, help can be hard to find and Singaporeans generally aren’t very accepting of people with mental illnesses. From my personal experience, it was very hard, as a youth with untreated depression and no parental support, to find the help I needed. I tried many things: contacting government organisations, getting myself therapists sessions with student subsidy (still too expensive to be sustainable), getting antidepressants from the black market, even attempting to administer CBT on myself. Only when I got warded did my parents take me seriously.
Also, mental illness isn’t something Singaporeans are really comfortable discussing. As mentioned above, many cases I know of kids struggling with serious mental illnesses and family issues are kept under wraps because of the stigma. This seriously prevents people from realising how big of a problem this is in Singaporean schools.
Most importantly, mental health seems to be a very underfunded and underdeveloped area in Singapore’s healthcare system. This despite the fact that the rest of Singapore’s healthcare system is pretty much stellar. I heard about this from others, but never really understood the seriousness of the problem until my stay in IMH. The psychiatrists there seem very overworked, the ward was always filled to near full capacity (there was only one child ward, and people were being discharged way before they were ready to make space for others) and the practices within the ward (ie. physical restraints for even the slightest aggression) were seriously outdated. This really surprised me because I have had nothing but good experiences from hospitals for my physical illnesses from government/non-private hospitals.
Singapore’s education system is often seen as a stellar model internationally. Apparently, we are the country with the biggest number of top scorers in the IB program (and similarly in the A levels). But I can vouch that there are major problems behind the scenes in Singaporean schools.
I don’t have exact numbers or statistics, but I can say for a fact that many Singaporean kids are suffering as a result of the toxic competitiveness rampant among parents, schools, and the entire education system as well as the pressure to do well for exams. It isn’t uncommon to find Singaporean students struggling with diagnosed mental conditions as a result of studies, especially in the more elite schools. There are known cases of students killing themselves over grades. My own brother (who studied at a top JC) killed himself two years ago, partly due to the immense stress to perform academically. During my time in the ward, I met at least 4 other kids from top secondary schools and JCs who either attempted suicide or seriously self-harmed as a direct result of school stress. This probably isn’t even surprising for many Singaporeans, but most of these cases rarely reach the media, or even anybody from outside the schools, because the school management/government bodies are very tight-lipped about things like this. This leads me to my next point.
2. Treatment of youths with mental illness

Only when I got warded did I get taken seriously by both my family and the health system.
Also, mental illness is something many Singaporeans take to great lengths to hide. As mentioned above, many cases I personally know of youths struggling with serious mental illnesses and family issues are strongly hidden because of the stigma. These kids are often seen and treated as normal by their community and even their friends. This even applies when it comes to serious incidents and deaths by suicide, with families and institutions often changing the truth. This strongly prevents the general public from realizing how big of a problem this is.
Most importantly, mental health seems to be a very underfunded and underdeveloped area in Singapore’s healthcare system. This is despite the fact that the rest of Singapore’s healthcare system is excellent. I heard about this from others, but never really understood the seriousness of the problem until my stay at IMH. The psychiatrists there seem very overworked, the ward was always filled to near full capacity (there was only one child ward, and people were being discharged before they were ready to make space for others) and the practices within the ward (ie. physical restraints for even the slightest aggression) were extremely outdated. This really surprised me because I have had nothing but good experiences with hospitals for my physical illnesses from non-private hospitals.
3. The social/class …
This is a serious problem that starts early in life for most Singaporeans. As a kid from an upper-middle class upper-middle-class family in Singapore, I rarely had the chance to mix around with kids children from other backgrounds because of the way the education system is structured.¶

structured and Singapore’s strong focus on meritocracy (judging excellence purely by qualifications).¶

Richer kids go to better kindergartens when they are toddlers, elite primary schools, then elite secondary schools. Outside of school, the richer kids would usually are often made to have tuition or enrichment classes to occupy their time, which essentially gears time (which to be fair, is its own kind of misery). These classes are often specially designed for them to score better well in exams and (more importantly) to get into the elite schools. Richer parents also tend to be much harsher on their kids in terms of performance. The less privileged families cannot afford this kind of special treatment, especially the extra out-of-school lessons lessons, and therefore, their kids usually don’t do as well academically, which causes them to go to more average schools. As these kids people grow up and enter the workforce, they are discriminated against based on their qualifications, qualifications due to the strong meritocracy in Singapore, making it very hard for these less privileged kids the less privileged to climb the social ladder. These less privileged kids The less privileged kids are often also placed in environments where it is very easy to get involved with gangs, drugs drugs, and crime in their youth too.¶

Therefore, everybody loses. The privileged kids often live a very sheltered lifestyle, which narrows their worldview and reduces their empathy towards the less privileged and the less privileged kids while many less privileged kids will miss out on opportunities to better their situation. This is a very complex problem to solve.¶

It is also worth mentioning that a great number of kids I saw in the child psych ward came from the lower classes and many were struggling with drugs, self harm and suicidal thoughts self-harm, and suicide as a result of their circumstances. I learnt genuinely learned a lot from them, and their multitude of experiences. I never had the chance to meet these kind of kids kinds of people in my childhood due to my intensely sheltered upbringing.

There I won’t claim to have the answer to any of these problems because they are many other problems obviously complex. I can think of, but am just here to express my answer would go on forever.

What is Singapore's biggest flaw, in your opinion?
I am only 17, turnin…
I don’t have exact numbers or statistics, but I can say for a fact that many Singaporean kids are suffering as a result of the toxic competitiveness rampant among parents, schools and the entire education system as well as the pressure to do well for exams. It isn’t uncommon to find Singaporean students struggling with clinical depression, anxiety, self harm and suicidal thoughts as a result of stress and studies, especially in the more elite schools. There are even cases of students killing themselves over grades (links below). grades. My own brother (who studied in one of the top JCs) killed himself two years ago, partly due to the pressure from my parents to do well. During my time in the ward, I met at least 4 kids from top secondary schools and JCs who either attempted suicide or seriously self harmed as a result of school stress. This probably isn’t surprising for many Singaporeans, but most of these cases rarely reach the media, or even anybody from outside the schools, because the school management/government bodies are very tight lipped about things like this. Which leads me to my next point.
2. Treatment of peop…
I can’t really speak for older people (ie. people of working age and the elderly), but for youths with mental illnesses, help can be hard to find and Singaporeans generally aren’t very accepting of people with mental illnesses. From my personal experience, my parents wouldn’t take me seriously when I told them I might have depression (they just told me I was lazy) and it was very hard, as a youth with untreated depression and no parental support, to find the help I needed. I tried many things: contacting government organisations, getting myself therapists sessions with student subsidy (still too expensive to be sustainable), getting antidepressants from the black market, even attempting to administer CBT on myself. Only when I got warded did my parents take me seriously.
Also, mental illness…

Well articulated.
Nigeria is not only a failed state but it's in a state of madness. A state where criminals are being celebrate. It is only in an insane country that those who have looted the treasury will be celebrated and given awards. Almost all her institutions are lying comatose. From poor health care, to weak educational standards, poor economic decisions etc.
Nigeria is a country where some people feel they are of more importance or rather superior to others. Their level of insanity is one too complex.

No lie, I actually caught on to this in my relationship and successfully carried out some narcissistic actions. I actually convinced her that I was the NARC. It brought about so much peace in the relationship, however it was so exhausting. I sold her dreams. I baited her, I lied, I flirted with other women, I did it all. She was hooked for a few weeks but once she moved back in the demons that possess reappeared. I am genuinely a good person and could not keep hurting someone that I loved just so they could stay around.

The molality of a 1L solution with x% NaOH by weight is 2. The weight of the solvent present in the solution is 900g. What is the value of x?
Molality = (moles of solute/molecular weight of soulte)/ mass of solvent in kg.
900g/ ~40g/mol = 22.5mols of NaOH
1L = 1kg (assuming the density is ~1.00g/ml)
molality = 22.5/1kg

I hear Michael Jordan is a terrible person off the court, but we can go on and on about how terrible athletes can be in their personal lives. I mean they're paid millions to do something that they love doing and are glorified for it. On a little note let's talk about players who are really good people outside of sports but we love to hate while in their element, like I can't stand Tom Brady, Lebron James, but I think they'd be really cool to hangout with.

How do you lose weight? I'm currently a shameful 271lbs 5'0. I've been seeing a nutritionist for 2 years. I walk 1 mile every day and count my calories going under 1200 and only maintain between 259-275. I'm losing hope to be healthy.

As I said in my prior comment, I am NOT a therapist. I am a therapy client who was curious about other therapists’ perspectives about the ethical implications of this situation.

Thanks for the recommendation, it’s an excellent one, but unfortunately does not apply to the situation in the way you imagined! In this scenario, I am asking to crowdsource based on my own curiosity. I am not a therapist, but rather a therapy client. The therapist in question did seek input from their supervisor prior to responding to the situation. I am simply interested in additional perspectives.

What should one do if they feel like their therapist is not paying attention to them during psychotherapy sessions?
In my experience, this would likely tell me more about my own emotional climate at that time, rather than informing me of some kind of new information about my therapist. What I mean by that is- I would want to begin paying more attention to what evidence is leading me to that conclusion, and then also examine where else in my life I might be experiencing that dynamic, to inform me of why it might suddenly be showing up in therapy.

Can a therapist intern (I believe they are reporting to a therapist or psychologist or something) diagnose mental illness/mental disorders?
A doctoral intern at the university I attended for my undergraduate degree took the lead on determining a diagnosis for me, but only in consultation with a licensed professional, and appropriate supervision. Our first session together was recorded (with my consent) and watched by their supervisor, as part of their internship coursework. They received feedback and suggestions from their supervisor, which I was not involved with. Ultimately, we all met together in a separate session several days later to review and discuss the determination that was made collectively by both of them.

How should you position your contributions in a résumé?
In short, I would recommend positioning your contributions strategically, based first on relevance to the position you are applying for, and second on how recently they happened. That way, the most relevant and important details appear as close to the beginning of the page as possible to make the maximum impact. For example, let’s you wanted to list three contributions you made at a company on a resume that you are using to apply for a position in a slightly different field than your current one. Current Company, Current Position: Contribution #1: This should be the most relevant contribution you made, based on the “New Position” you are applying for. If you made two equally relevant contributions at this company, you can list the most recent one first, then the second one after. Contribution #…

How distinguished is Emerson’s “Business Creative Enterprises” program?
I think that depends on what you mean by distinguished. The program is fairly new and although it is run by extremely knowledgeable and experienced folks in the industry, it hasn’t been around for long enough to earn any awards or recognition more broadly. Outcomes-wise, there haven’t been many graduates from the program (yet) since it is so new, so it’s hard to say how the degree and coursework prepare students for the industry based on actual data. That said, the curriculum is excellent and students really benefit from the mentorship of the program’s faculty! In addition, Emerson’s Career Development Center has been rated very highly in national rankings for several years, so BCE students who engage with them are likely going to have better outcomes than students in comparable BCE program…

Which professors at the Salem State University would you recommend taking classes from?
There are a lot of professors who are lovely but one who sticks out to me is Steve Oliver.
He teaches in the education department. Although I took courses with him as a graduate student in the higher education and student affairs program, he also offers courses not focused on higher education.
I took his course focused on LGBT+ Issues in Higher Education and it was EXCELLENT. I can’t say enough about both how knowledgeable he was about the topic and how much I learned from this course.

Man i think marvel fanboys should think about 'The Seven Deadly Sins' meliodas as there enemy and the deamon king meliodas will be enough to kill fantastic four avengers and the odin. Forget about Goku who can move himself from the middle of the universe to the other side of the universe in a second with the instant transmission.

To be honest the World War hulk is not as powerful as jiren if we observe the Jiren vs Goku's martered ultra instinct fight so how can marvel's earthlings can destroy Goku and Vaget's tag team ? But marvel will be a formidable foe for Goku and Vageta. One last thing Goku and Vageta's body maybe too stronger and thougher for Franklin, Phoenix, molecule man because Vageta's eloved super saiyan blue was undefeated by the 11th universe's top who will be the next destroyer. So destructive powers won't work agaist these two. Few of the immortal beings of marvel universe will be able to fight with goku and vegeta and marvel's true fans will accept this too. While Halk can defeat most of the marvels heroes based on the fans of marvel and halk will be over powered by androids or Gohan from DBZ universe no need for goku or vageta 😂

But if sarada and boruto masters their visual powers then they'll be the next most powerful of the hidden leaf and we can't deny the sage power of mitsuki.

Generally true but there's one thing in discussions about energy drinks that even some doctors keep saying just popular phrases. Maybe because of the word “energy”, maybe because people have no idea how much caffeine is in one cup of coffee, they constantly say how much caffeine is inside. No. Basically, it's less than in one coffee so 500 ml, 1 Monster, would give about 160 mg of caffeine, 2 monsters 320 mg. Typical safe limit is 400 mg. The issue is in the mix of used substances and high levels of B vitamins. Consuming too much B vitamins can be harmful. Also, taurine can put extra stress on the body, as far as I know.
What I see is I drink less red bulls and have more energy. I don't know why it's that way. Maybe less substances that could counteract the effects. Maybe I drink monster faster so the energy isn't sustained?

It is okay to drink alcohol 10 hours after my first dosage of Medikinet/Ritalin (20 mg)?
If I’ve got your question right - you asked about standard, instantaneous release form of medication. If yes, then it will be good because Ritalin works up to 3–4 hrs basically. If it’s an extended release medication - Concerta is designed to work up to 12 hrs and Ritalin/Medikinet extended about 10 hrs. Of course everything depends and for one it’s 12 hrs but for others it can be less. Other thing is how long you take it so if your body can have anything from the previous day or not (for Concerta there’s an accumulation). In Medikinet extended the half of drug is slowly released during next hours after dosing. TL;DR: Based on my explanations - the best will be to wait 2 more hours (12 hrs after dose) and then drink - it’s the safest. But amount of drug should be already really small in your…

I think question isn’t about “ADHD and alcohol” but more about “ADHD medication and alcohol” - so I don’t think your response contribute to discussion in any way.

Nothing against realtors, but is selling a home by owner really that complicated? Especially if you have a house that you know would sell quickly?
I sold both of my houses by myself without a realtor. It's definitely doable; you just need to take the time to carefully read all the contracts. I don't find it justified to pay for a seller's realtor's fee. A little background: I'm a nurse and had no experience with selling and buying houses. English is also my second language. I paid a small fee for the listing agent to list my house on MLS and agreed to pay 2.5% for the buyer's realtor. I scheduled my own showings and contacted the buyer's realtor directly if there were any questions. I prepared any necessary paperwork for the contract and had it ready. The rest was taken care of by the title company. My responsibility was to ensure the house was intact and exactly as described. It seemed daunting at first, but I don't think it's impossi…

My partner loves to drink, or in his words, he enjoys doing it every night. Each time, he would drink two bottles of wine or five to six cans of beer. He would sit on the sofa and often pass out on it until midnight. When I told him my concern, he asked why I was concerned since he didn't do anything wrong. He just enjoys drinking in our own house. He still wakes up every morning and works like everybody else. He told me his dad hasbeen drinking straight whiskey for over 60 years and he was just fine. His mom had a drinking habit as well and still worked. I told him he is not his dad, and it is not okay to drink two bottles of wine daily. He got mad. How can I convince him to cut back? Or my concerns are valid? Am I worried too much?

Is it okay to drink two bottles of wine or five to six cans of beer almost daily? My partner often says he is making good money and is in great health. He also points out that his parents have been drinking for over 60 years and are still alive.

How does one throw things?
It is not an easy task. I have accumulated quite a bit of stuff, clothing during my 17 years living in the US. Then I moved out of my 1st house where I stayed for more than 12 years and realized how much stuff did I have. I couldn't believe it because it took me a whole week to box everything up. That was when I realized those stuff would need to go. 1st I had the boxes that I used to put stuff in that I hadn't used for the last 3 years. These either went to Goodwill or gave away for free on craigslist. 2nd I rented a dumpster and just threw stuff I didn't need in. I lived by myself at that time so my goal was to fit everything I needed in a medium size Uhaul and I did it. Once I threw everything away, I just don't think about it anymore and feel so much lighter until today. In my new house,…

I quit my hospital nursing job to work for the state so I can work normal schedule and spend time with my son. I got a big paid cut. Now my son is old enough to stay home alone and be more independent, I am thinking going back to the hospital. However working for the government has its perk (pension, holiday off and cheap insurance…) I am now questioning myself should I leave it to go back to higher paid job. Do you think pension really worth it? I do invest in 401k and Roth and other investment accounts on the side.

If autistic people are empathetic, why do I feel like I have no empathy? My parents also said I lack empathy.
Autism comes in many various forms, expressions, and ways. Every case is unique to each other; doesn’t make one less empathic or more so. A neurodivergent person shows their emotions in other manners. Or rarely. Doesn't change the fact that they still feel. Unfortunately, is a common misconception that autistic people lack empathy or are robotic when expressing themselves. Some chose to mask to blend into other people —— others risk becoming excluded from social activities if they don't. The main issue here is to make a bridge between you and your parents. Because once both parties understand the way you communicate, it will be better for all of you. Don't be afraid to ask questions on whatever you're doing is wrong for their social cues and make them explain what they feel and why they do so…

I have a boy in class who’s extremely cute and attractive. He gets bullied and sometimes beaten by other boys, but when I asked him to go out with me yesterday he declined. Why? I am pretty.
Back in the day, I got bullied. That in itself was stressful enough and that's without counting a love life (which I didn't have).
It's common for people who get bullied that people make pranks about asking them out (especially when they're considered pretty or popular) so it could be he doesn't trust you.
Give him time, be genuinely his friend, many probably have exploited his trust already, he must be wary. Although, do respect his choice; it's often bullied people who don't have that privilege.

What are the best ways to increase chances of living to be a hundred years old?
The key to living a long life is to have a healthy body. You have to master this schedule:
-exercise often
-have a healthy diet
-drink enough water
-stretch
-go on a walk
This is what I learned from my grandparents. They seem to be doing well despite being over 70 yrs old. I noticed that they occasionally exercise by going on walks and stretch their body.

My ex doesn't want to be friends with me and it's upsetting me what do I do?
You're your worst enemy. You're the creator of your own problem. You do: accept the fact that - your ex doesn't want any contact with you anymore. Once you accept that reality, the problem will go away. She's blocked you on all media, etc.; why try to keep finding a way to get back into her life? Let it go. Let her go. Move on with your life. It might take time, howbeit you have to move on. Replace missing her with becoming active, working out, walking, etc.; you have to fill your life with other things. The sooner you stop ""agonizing"" over trying to keep in touch with her and being ""bewildered,"" the sooner you will move on. That might sound harsh and cold; however, the bottom line is - it's the truth.

I’m sorry, but as a teen myself often kids don’t feel comfortable coming to their parents about a lot of things due to fear of punishment and trust. Parents should make it clear that they are ALWAYS a safe place to come to, and this will make the kid feel a lot more comfortable telling their parents things. In the long run, even if the kid does do something bad, I think parents should listen and understand the kid’s side of the story before punishment to try and grasp the kids perspective. Even if your girlfriend’s son was using drugs, I don’t think your immediate choice to take everything useful and entertaining in his life away is fair at all. You never know the reasons why someone might do drugs, high school and teenage years are difficult these days, and it’s not fair to assume. They might be going through a difficult time, and struggling, using drugs as an unhealthy coping mechanism. Same goes for teenagers, their emotions and feelings are valid and they deserve to be heard, and parents behaving this way often causes the kid to rebel and become more sneaky since they feel they are unable to come to the parent. So many kids such as myself struggle with anxiety and depression and this affects life so much, so please don’t assume that the emotions he showed you are fake, from what I read it seems he was genuinely frustrated and upset. I understand you care about him and want the best for him, but please understand that your assumptions about his emotions being fake, his possible drug use, and not trusting him will destroy his trust for you. He sounds like a great, hardworking, honest student. The last thing he deserves is this kind of emotional pain to be put on him by parental figures he should feel comfortable with. Please, take this into consideration, it’s really something I wish I could have had growing up, it will make a more positive, open energy in your family and he will appreciate it a lot.

What is 2 + 2? My math teacher thinks it is 5. I think it is 2. Who is right?
Actually, it’s 6

Today I received a letter from California State Tax Board stating that I didn't file there and can be owed $15k for 2019. I moved out of state end of 2014. The only thing that happened in 2019 was I sold my California house, since I'm permanently living in a different state. I know all the taxes were taken out when we closed. I didn't file anything for CA as I was not a resident and did not earn any income there. Is there any reason I needed to file in CA? Is this legit? Will this backfire somehow?

Yikes. Have you ever explored any of this with a therapist? “A grown child sucking on your tit?” You are sexualizing a mother feeding & Bonding with her child.
Our breasts were designed to feed our offspring. It’s always the right temp, available and ready. Our babies have the reflex to root and find their food source. There are valuable health benefits for mother and child. Reduced breast cancer rates, the perfectly balanced milk for the child’s age, love hormones are released as you hold your baby and gaze into their little eyes. The fact that it’s 2023 and we are still sexualizing the feeding of babies is wild. Just because you see breasts as sexual and only as sexual is a you problem, not a breastfeeding mamas problem.
Fed is best. If you don’t want to breastfeed or can’t, you use formula. That’s not a failure , you’re feeding your baby. I breastfed all 3 of mine and supplemented with formula. It is all good. But do not entangle your sexual hang ups and ick on breastfeeding mothers.

I manage people and have only contacted people off the clock when they have been previously unresponsive, or have had a serious misdeed and HR has requested I contact them immediately. Generally it’s not good news but that’s just how I do it at my place of biz.

Well IF you go open your map or internet and see or well research. You will find that WOW surprisingly that other than China, Korea, Japan etc. There ARE other countries in ASIA. It’s not the largest continent just for namesake and Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh etc ALSO have a SIMILAR culture to India. If you go a bit to the northwest from there then you will see UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Palestine, Jorden, Yemen etc. These countries are ALSO IN ASIA. Part of the middle east. Plus India is not a subcontinent BUT it is the INDIAN subcontinent IN Asia which consist of the countries in South Asia. Just because Asia is such a big continent people have grouped similar countries together just so it's easier to refer to and understand. It does not mean any of us are any less Asian than the people in East and South-East Asia.

Quiet kid
Average Jane/Jo
Edgy (except for the concert part cuz nahh )
Soft girls (only first and second point)
Tomboy(except that I’m in an all-girls school and don't have short hair and have to wear a uniform which is a long skirt and t-shirt)
Kpop Stan
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you do read this then you could add the
geeks who know all about the latest technology
And the Media kids who have a secret internet life (making edits working with videos and editing sound and all that ) but at school, they are the avg Jo or Smth else
and the shy kids ( who are just too scared to talk to ppl but their close friends know how insane they actually are)
and the INTROVERTS

Therapy, medication, books, volunteering, support groups, meditation, spirituality, yoga, running, serving in AmeriCorp, volunteering in Cambodia and even TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) has helped.

I have achieved more than I ever thought I would. At the same time I feel the pain and sorrow of the life around me. Thinking about the past makes me depressed, the future causes me anxiety.

I am tired of existing. I am 55 yo. I have had a good life, 2 awesome sons, and a husband who I was in love with. The beginning to my end was right after my 40 th birthday when my spouse at the time, realized that he was able to attract others that he wanted. The MD label didn’t hurt, my eldest went to college and he was gone. The divorce became permanent. The same week the last child left, my house sold, my brother died suddenly. My life was permanently altered. Within 6 months, I moved cross country again to care for my aging parents who died the next year, 6 months apart. I have 3 wonderful sisters, a bunch of cousins.

You may want to look at what problems you have now to discover where they might have come from. An important research study over decades was done by the CDC and Kaiser about adverse childhood experiences, ACE. The study has found a direct link to premature death and health problems with adults who experience a high ACE score. The 10 questions cover Abuse. Physical. Emotional. Sexual. Neglect. Physical. Emotional. Household Dysfunction. Mental Illness. See https://www.acesconnection.com/ for more information. The higher your ACE score, the more you are at risk of disease and social problems. An example - If a person answers yes to 4 of the questions they are twice as likely to smoke.

pressures plus unfair treatments over Lewis are the main reason for his failure withn Mercedes. of course being the second driver in a team is less favorable, yet he has the potential to win if everything is more or less equal for both. but he has so far been openly denied a place he deserves

I gotta disagree. Or, at least, it’s a bit different here in Canada.
If you wanted to express that in past tense in the sense of having acquired an umbrella, you’d say:
“Did you get an umbrella?”
OR
“Have you gotten an umbrella?”
I’d say the first is more common, but not by that much.
When it comes to “Have you got an umbrella”, this may sound a tad strange in North American English. I suspect this is because most people who go for the got phrasing will also drop the have and just say “You got an umbrella?”, which is definitely not past tense.

In a short sentence can you describe how smoking marijuana helps you or why you enjoy it or not? For me, it’s a natural antidepressant which is more effective and has less nasty side effects compared to prescription antidepressants from the doctor.

In certain states, the number may be lower. For example, in New Mexico, 14 is the age you can begin making medical decisions, such as consenting to medication.

Do bipolar patients share medications with eachother?
You should never share prescription medication, even if the other person(s) take the same medication. The only person who should be taking the prescription is whoever has their name on it. Some bipolar people might share their medication with each other, but they should not.

Why do antidepressants not work for me? I went through six different medications without results.
As someone that’s taken many, many anti-depressants: I understand your struggle. For some of us, they just don’t work. I’d suggest talking to your doctor about trying mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. You can also try and reduce your vulnerabilities (if any) through the acronym PLEASE (which is a DBT skill):
Treat PhysicaL Illness
Balance Eating (not eating too much or too little)
Avoid Mood-Altering Drugs (besides your Rx meds of course!)
Balance Sleeping (not sleeping too much or too little)
Exercise (get some physical activity. Sometimes you might have to force yourself to get up and get moving, but all you have to do is maybe walk around your living area for a little while.)
I hope you find your fit, whether or not it involves medication! Best of luck.

I remember when a couple of my acquantainces (as in, I would occasionally talk to them and some of their friends) in their early teens went missing and were found dead and buried out on the mesa, no one was actually surprised (except for my mother, and probably a good amount of adults, of course). It’s a sad look into New Mexico (specifically ABQ) and how often crime is a part of our lives that it was so easy to just kind of brush off.

Hi! My name is Ryan. I'm 17 and my pronouns are they/them. I'm non-binary and bisexual. I like music, memes, art, and vampires. I play guitar and write fanfiction, and I'm also a very outspoken anarchist. I'm also a Jewish convert. I suffer from ADHD, depression, and anxiety, but I'm still pretty fun to be around. I'll be friends with anyone, but I prefer partners within my age range (16–18). My messages are open to all 💖

Why is it said that most of the Bolsheviks were actually Jews?
Anti-semitism and anti-communist propaganda. The white supremacist capitalist system doesn't like Jews, and it doesn't like commies, so if something bad happens it must be because of the “Jewish commies”.

Is there anyone who can tell Biden that we cannot survive supporting never ending rivers of millions flocking here at this point?
I’m a Brit and weirdly this is a very pertinent question. A few years ago 51% of our country voted to leave the European Union. Being a member of the EU gave us the right to work, live and travel to 27 other countries. When Brexit went live 27 countries lost their right to come and live, work and study here in the U.K. the results so far: we have had crops rotting in fields due to a drastic lack of migrant workers. restaurant prices have gone through the roof as they compete to try and recruit and retain staff. want an au-pair as a cheap nanny? Ha ha ha ha ha. Nope. the most respected focal examiner in the country has looked at our current figures and has confirmed that the U.K.’s prospects are roughly 15% lower than they would have been had we remained in Europe. inflation has jumped from 1.25% to 10.1% (though that is in part due to war in Ukraine and Liz truss single handedly buggering up our economy) We have lost vast numbers of: doctors nurses teachers carers dentists academics researchers teachers social workers I’ve had more than 20 friends return to Europe all of who were higher rate tax payers. immigration benefits a country. we are paying the price.

As a house cleaner, what mess made you want to leave as soon as you opened the house door?
I was contacted by a 30 something man to clean his kitchen. Upon arrival he told me we need to talk. He went on to explain that a year and a half previous his mother passed of natural causes in their home she still cared for. Since that day very little cleaning had been done to resume normal life. He asked for the kitchen to be done but what he really needed was the kitchen floor tackled. He paid for 4 hours of work. For only the floor. A 10x12 foot box elevated from adjoining rooms. I thought this would be a breeze. :/ Until I saw the 2 foot thick sludge that was the floor. I immediately told him the flooring may need replaced. He said that was expected. “Just make it so I can enter this room again!” I asked for a shovel. And spent the next 3 hours prying this sludge from the floor. One small 1foot by 1foot section had to be torn up of the linoleum to replace due to excessive damage. The rest I had managed to save. When the son saw the completed job at 4 and a half hours in he was astounded. Handed me an estimate for replacement flooring he had already received from the company he chose to do the work. I'd just saved him the better part of $1,800. He noted that I'd already worked half an hour past my required time and asked why. I told him it wasn't quite finished and I knew I could make it shine. His response? Handed me a $500 tip with a note attached saying “Basic human compassion is at an all time low! I'm incredibly grateful God sent you!” The last thing I did was sit on the porch with father and son and enjoyed a freshly catered lunch of Mexican food with amazing conversation with a man close to my age with deep wounds from his mom's loss and a broken man older and looking at a life where most adventures had already passed him by! As I was leaving the son stopped me and added one of the greatest compliments I've ever gotten, “that's the first time I've seen him smile for real since Mom passed.” I'm glad I gave them peace of mind. I'm even more humbled that I was given the chance to show compassion still exists. *Edited to include* WOW! I wrote a simple truthful answer and your reaction to it has reafirmmed MY faith in the compassion of humanity! Almost 900k views, 15.5k upvotes!!!!? Your responses bring tears to my eyes! Thank you for sharing a snapshot of my life in such a resounding way! Each and every one of you! *Edited Monday Sep 18th Due to some nasty comments I feel the need to explain a few things here. First, the reason I shared this post is because of the way its personally effected myself and those men involved. This is a memory that I've cherished since it's conception. I still periodically speak to the son involved, although the father has since passed. I shared because we are so often flooded with negatives. In the news, on TV, in real life. WE NEED MORE FEEL GOOD IN THIS WORLD. I hope I gave you a slice, some small thing to smile for. And for those who miss the explanation to the twit in the comment board.. HUMBLE is NOT a cloak one wears to impress the multitudes. It's a lifepath. A helpmate. A guiding stone. A hearts reflection. A souls mirror. If YOU BOTHER TO PAY IN. *I will not be editing this post again, but I will continue to respond to those comments that come in. Both ridiculous and amazing!*

What would you do if your neighbor came to your front door in a barely controlled rage?
I had this happen to me. My family and I were at home one evening, when all the sudden someone started frantically pounding on my front door. My wife opened the door to the neighbor lady who was crying hysterically. She invited her in, and she told us her husband was in a rage, and had put his hands on her. About that time, the husband came charging through my front door, and began verbally assaulting his wife with profanity at the top of his lungs. In MY living room. Before I had a chance to address the situation, my older daughter told him to tone it down, at which point he responded with “shut the F!#K up, B#!CH”. The words barely left his lips before those lips were introduced to my fist. Turns out he had no interest in fighting another man. Once he found his feet, he was out my front door faster than he barged in. I'm sure most of the folks reading this will be disgusted with my actions. I Don't care. What does matter to me, is the opinion of that man's wife. Years later, she thanked me, saying he never put his hands on her again. Not because he didn't want to, but because he was afraid she would run to my house! Fine by me.

What’s something in a woman’s apartment that sets off red flags?
While at one of my art classes I got talking to the model and ended up taking her out after class. About 10pm we went our separate ways she suggested I come by her place tomorrow night to watch a movie together in her apartment as we were both learning Swedish and there was a Swedish art type film she wanted to see. So, the next day, I turn up at her apartment with Tesco’s finest bottle of vino and some snacks (just in case she actually wanted to watch the movie). Her place was small,but well kept. Nothing out of the ordinary, a few posters on her wall of art type things and interesting painting’s artists had done of her and for her. But I noticed that there was no TV. So we’re talking and chilling out drinking wine, and she tells me she has some art of her own she’d like to show me. And leads me to her bedroom. On the wall is a big red painting on canvas, one of these abstract pieces all different shades of red. [Something like this]: I actually don’t really care for art pieces of this kind, but I was polite and just mentioned the things I did like about it. Then she told me it was painted using her own blood. She gave a casual explanation like it was the most normal thing in the world, and mentioned that another famous artist had done something similar. Ok…,but it doesn't end there,folks… I turn around and see beautifully presented and framed black and white photos of… something… I couldn't quite make it out. I asked what they where and she replied: “Oh,these are microscopic photographs. This one is of my mother’s cervix, this one my menstrual blood and the one on the end there is my brother’s semen”. I made my excuses and left.

Can doctors share with us how discouraging it is when patients don’t follow their medical advice?
About a year ago a young, Spanish speaking mother came into the ER with her two children. The older child was about 5 and the younger (who was my patient) was two. The two year old girl had an ear infection. When I started looking at her chart I discovered she had been there the day before and prescribed an inexpensive antibiotic and ear drops for pain. As I examined the little girl I spoke with the mother using a translator and found out she didn’t get the medicine that was prescribed the day before. This was not a diagnostic dilemma. The patient has an obvious issue treated with a medication that typically works…. If you take it. The chart from the day before had discharge instructions in Spanish so in my mind the visit was complete. Diagnosis=otitis media. Treatment= same as what we told you yesterday. Frustrating that they came back to the ER but no surprise she wasn’t better. I went about my shift and discharged them summarily and didn’t give it another thought. These things happen about three times a shift in the ER. On my way home after my ten hours in the pit I stopped at a stoplight two miles from the hospital. I saw a homeless man on one corner with a cardboard sign asking for money. On another corner however was a well dressed, young Hispanic woman with a sign that said “baby sick.. need money for medicine”. I realized she looked familiar and was suddenly struck by the truth this was the mother of the patient I dismissed early in the day. I pulled my car over and walked up to her and in my broken Spanish apologized to her. I gave her $20 for her antibiotic and ear drops and begged her to go home where I was sure the five year old was trying to care for the two year old who was crying with ear pain. I don’t tell this story because I did a good thing by giving someone money. In fact, I’m ashamed to remember it. I failed this lady and her child and endangered them all because I dismissed them out of hand as non compliant. The truth is that patients come to us for our advice. Typically at significant cost in time or money. If they choose not to follow our advice I think the least we can do is ask “why?”. Sometimes it is a lack of understanding due to poor communication. Sometimes they don’t like the advice or recommendations. Sometimes though, they want to be compliant and will take steps to do so that would humble you. However, they could still fail and it is wrong to blame the patient for not getting better.

Spot on, especially the number 10. When most people around you seems confuse when you are being cold. They tend to think that it has something to do with them personally. What they don't understand is we feel exhausted most of the time.sometimes cos those empathy and emotions are too much.

Hi Richard- Bad things happen in life. People sometimes end up dying in wars, disasters, fires, violence, tragic accidents… Even the early Christians were burned at the stake, boiled in oil, thrown into a pit with lions for the entertainment of the Romans. Do we have guardian angels? if so, how does that work?

If you choose the beneficiary route, make sure you know that there is a difference between co owner of the account, where the parent simply adds the name to the account, and adding the name as a beneficiary. There is a difference and you should consult somebody. Little details can have an effect on outcomes.

The system of tipping is getting out of hand. But tipping is still optional. I usually leave 15 or 20%. Maybe 25% if the service is exceptionally good. But for rude or demeaning service, I don’t leave a tip.

Is there a boxer who is known for being difficult to knock down or knock out due to their strength, speed, skills, or stamina?
All pretty tough guys to be sure, but let’s not forget the Canadian, George Chuvalo known for having never been knocked down in his 93 bout professional career including fights against Ali, Frazier and George Foreman. Ali himself called Chuvalo “the toughest guy I ever fought.”

The boss is of course, capable of making his own coffee, but in this case, it’s not about the coffee. The transaction is symbolic- the boss is being territorial and ordering an employee to subordinate themselves to his domination.

What job looks fancy but actually sucks?
College professor here. Recently retired after over 43 years. The the first poster nailed it:
College professor: When I was growing up, this career conjured up images of wearing a tweed jacket in a pleasant, book-filled, paneled room while discussing Proust. Today, it means no job security, political correctness run utterly amok, constant monitoring of everything you say and do, and dealing with all kinds of unstable, unpleasant, half-mad people.
The way he imagined it while growing up was a fairly accurate snapshot of what being a college professor was still like in the early 1980’s. But now, I am glad I’m out. The inmates are running the assylum. If I were young now, I would learn a trade.

Yes, much of love is opportunism nowadays. Or just sexual gratification with no soul ties or bonding. But people can rise higher if they are so inclined. Consider how people are at the end of life. I have seen men and women stick with a partner after a debilitating stroke.—even when the healthy one is attractive and able to get another partner. I know of a case where a house was burning down. An old bedridden man was trapped in corner as the fire burned around him. His wife died when she attempted to walk through a solid wall of fire to rescue him. Don’t be so cynical about love- it exists and its real. What we need is a more specific definition of what we mean when we say love.

Doesn’t compute. Because your dad is 82 and doesn’t know what a domain is, he’s gullible? Your dad may be smarter than you in other areas of life, including politics.. And the fact that the emails in question didn’t contain headers is not incontrovertible proof that they are fraudulent. Anybody with a modicum of computer skills can cut and paste text from an email into a pdf format, and for any number of reasons.

Brilliant idea. It’s not a final solution to homelessness, but a valuable step in the right direction. We have to do something about homelessness - it’s gone too far. American cities are starting to look like third world hellholes. I don’t see why something like this can’t be tried.

What are some good questions to ask in a Star Wars trivia contest?
Here is a question not just for a trivia contest, but one I have been wondering about for a long time.. Here goes: I saw an ephisode at a friend’s house about 40 years ago. There was a scene that I found very moving and I would like to watch it again. I will describe it although I may have some of the details wrong, as I remember only fragments of it. Anyway, in the episode, the crew somehow contacts a non-physical being in space. They channel information back and forth with this being. The crew is curious about what it is like to be a non-physical being that lives in spirit and they ask it many questions. And the being is also curious about how it feels to be a human being. So eventually it asks the crew if it can enter into one of their bodies to experience what it feels like to be a huma…

Great post and thank you for sharing! When my children were growing up, my main concern was just as yours is with your daughter…becoming entitled. It is awesome to read about other parents that know what being a parent actually entails. If children are not taught valuable lessons so they can grow in their human experience, they will become the types of adults that tend to bring society down.
This world needs more parents with a backbone like yourself. A parent that will not sway from their convictions. You are exactly correct about children will be angry with parents but it will be short lived. I would definitely choose to go with short term anger rather than knowing I was their friend.
I really want to tell you to stay the course as her parent. It seemed to me you explain things to her and why the punishment, is that correct? If it is correct, I commend you on actually communicating with her. You are a GREAT Mom! The hardest years are still to come but I have a good feeling you will be able to handle anything. Your daughter will be a reliable and contributing adult and a good friend I’m sure of it!

Extremely well said!! For basically 48 of 54 years of my life I was either the son of a mother with narcissistic traits or married to a woman with the same traits. I had always felt something wasn’t right in my life. Quora and the fellow survivors of this type of abuse were the primary catalysts of my “awakening to reality”. I am and always will be grateful to everyone for sharing their stories with myself and others. I know it takes alot of courage to relive the past each time someone we meet someone new that might benefit from our story. The more we share our experiences, our personal wounds start to heal and become easier to deal with. All the negative energy starts to lose it’s foothold in our DNA.
I do believe God has a plan for each and every one of us on this Earth. We are faced with certain trials and tribulations and walk thru hell on Earth so that we have a deep understanding that cannot be taught through a textbook or lectures. Then we use that understanding to help others in similar situations.
To comment on the original question…the survivors of any type of abuse researches what they are going through to understand it better and possibly find a way out of the situation. We write about things in books , websites, blogs, etc. . to make the world a little brighter and more positive.

My life was filled with my family love bombing me for years…48 years to be more precise. The source of it was my mother. Anytime she became upset in dealing (losing her control) with me, she would start to cry (manipulation). Then she would call in “reinforcements”. These family members, close family friends even some faculty in the local school district where was a nurse were completely aligned with her views. So when she talked to them about what I had done, they could only see it from her side. These reinforcements would then come to me and say “You know your mother loves you very much”.
The more I heard it, the more I became uncomfortable hearing it. It wasn’t until my mid 40’s and I was going through several difficult challenges in life. I was diagnosed with having symptoms of PTSD from military service. The love bombing from my mother and her reinforcements continued even then.
I still cannot pinpoint what happened or when it was that I finally realized what was going on. It’s sort of a blur. I saw the truth in reality and began to stand firm in my belief the love bombing was nothing more than my mother’s attempt to control me. When I understood her motives, I made a crack in her mask. Then came the discard. I just wish I understood this much sooner.
I credit much of my realization to those who have the courage to bring out their personal challenges in life and discuss them. Thank you to everyone for sharing their stories. Sharing is empowering! God Bless all of you!

What is a subtle sign of high intelligence?
“What is a subtle sign of high intelligence?” Richard Feynman said one of the joys of working with all the really smart people on the Manhattan Project was You never had to explain anything twice. Everyone was paying attention. Everyone understood the first time you said it. So I think “They got it the first time” is a sign of intelligence that many people might miss.

Sadly, as long as the child support money is paid, the courts don’t like to get involved in how the money is managed. It’s very frustrating for the parent paying the support money too.
Having been through this as a child and as a “targeted” parent, I know all too well what you are dealing with. I didn’t realize the complexity and the negativity of my situation until I was in my late 40’s. You cannot change others so don’t waste time and energy on them. The only thing you have control of is you and how you respond to others. Essentially, as the common theme seems to be, focus on your studies and have fun learning. If you are religious or spiritual, PRAY! The power of prayer is incredibly strong!
Also, I am going to strongly agree with the best revenge from Mark. Take pride in learning and growing as a human being. Live life and gravitate towards positive people. Getting away from the negative or nasty ugly side of life has made a huge difference in my life. It only took me almost 50 years to figure that out.
This is only a period of time in your life. You will come out of it. Try not to look at it as this is how your life will always be. YOU have the ability to change yourself. Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions or comments. I feel I was meant to endure my situation so that I could help others through similar situations.

Well said Martha! I am still struggling to accept how a mother could have the same feelings and attitudes towards someone she gave birth too. I am just so grateful that I realized and have had to accept my mother for who she really is. About two months ago, I was in a counseling session when I had to face a core value basically instilled by my mother….I was told I have a core value that I am not good enough. It explains alot of things in my life….until now. Knowledge is key!

It is very disappointing and sad. I don’t think politicians, especially the career politicians we have in the US, will ever change. It’s always a rush to push their agenda. There should be a law against anything happening legislatively for a certain amount of time. Humans need to go through the grieving process.

I agree with Linda. You should not be subjected to that sort of treatment! You deserve to be respected as a human being. I think going to a counselor at school is the best way to go. Do not ever blame yourself or think you are a bad person and that is why she is treating you this way. None of it is your fault!
I speak from experience. As I read your post, I could feel my stomach starting to get that nauseated feeling. Similar situations. There is one fact that is very different, and this is VERY important, You are noticing how you are being treated now at a very young age - I’m proud of you for acknowledging it and for the courage to change it. For me, the light bulb didn’t come on until a few years before I turned 50! You have your entire life ahead of you to recover.
When I talk to others about what I’ve gone through, a few thoughts always run through my mind.
The signs were there, why was it so hard for me to see them as I can clearly see the true reality (not the narcissitic personal made up reality) now?
What am I supposed to do now? Where do I start when I have questioned essentially everything in my life. How is one to continue when they learn they are co-dependant with no actual values to make a solid life from? For me personally, there was no choice but to push through it. Take one day at a time. Look for a meditation class in your area. Meditation and practicing mindfulness have been very effective in my situation.
Carly, I will remember you in my prayers. If I can deal with the trauma for 50 years, you can handle your situation. Don’t procrastinate. I have ALL the faith that you will stop the abuse. YOU are a SURVIVOR!
Feel free to DM me on here if you have any questions, comments or if you just need help with something. God Bless!

Be extremely, I mean extremely cautious when signing yourself into a psychiatric facility. I can only speak for myself. If you can, try to find someone who knows you and loves you and is willing to stay with you while your unhappy, because it will pass. No drug will take away emotional spiritual pain. The problem is that there are so few people who are compassionate and caring enough in this world that will go out of there way to ride out this nasty negative i mobilizer called depression. Please instead of going to a hospital where you will be given drugs that will mask what’s really going on with you emotionally and spiritually or physically even. Try to surround yourself with any kind of good. Whether it be music, kind words from good friends, hang on just hang on the depression will lift. Distract yourself as much as you can from your thinking by reading something good for your soul and watch good stuff not bad movies that have bad messages. But do not take yourself to a mental hospital.

Yet Amanda and the old man torture me all day every day when no one is around I am sick physically from it and I have no supports and all I want is for them to leave me alone but Amanda and the old man won’t stop and never sleep . They are all laughing about it and they are having a great time while Amanda put on some device that emits a high frequency sound that made me sick I felt like puking my ears hurt I had to open my windows and apartment door because it hurt that much and she says turn it down no keep it on no turn it down for 24 hours and change the setting and “I’m doing this for Giovanni and remo Molella “ I want to die I honestly don’t care about anything I know they are going to jump me as a group like they keep threatening or worse.

What are some ways to deal with the constant need for validation from a borderline partner?
That's on them. Borderline Personality Disorder is a very serious pathology, generally considered the most difficult to deal with personality disorder of all. Either put up with their increasing demands for loyalty, or leave. You can't change them, and any attempt will trigger their defences, and you will be met with violent rage. The pathology is a defence against being obliterated entirely or being left for dead (or for strangers) by the caregiver. You, far from being more powerful than them, are their “equal"" (oh my sides) and you have zero chance of making a dent in their armour. Zero. Nil. Zilch. Nada. That system protected an infant from highly aggressive adults. Lil’ old you is going to get suplexed. You're going to get torn a new one should you attempt to reparent (AKA shame) them to fit into the neurotypical world. A borderline partner is someone you want on the frontier, or at war, someone you need to have your back during times of intense stress and struggle. Borderlines may die for you, but they'd much rather kill for you. How is that going to play out at Starbucks, at the mall, at your parents place for dinner? If the environment is not bonding you together, the borderline will attempt to frighten you into bonding with them. They cannot bear half hearted commitment, it reminds them of childhood and burns them far worse than none at all. Borderlines need constant ride or die (“killer couples” tend to be one psychopath, one borderline) and are not suitable for vanilla romance and suburban environments. They can't deal with it, Robert

Can I ask where you were institutionalized? What happened that made your parents or whoever put you in there? Why were you there for so long and how were you able to get out? I have similar experiences with dissociating and worry about ending up in an institution one day.

Why can’t men and women just be friends?
I can quite easily sit next to a glass of water, and not drink it. It takes 0 effort on my part, there is not even a temptation to drink some random glass of water that’s been sitting around like that, if I even notice it in the first place. But if I were very very thirsty? Any liquid would start to look quite appealing. I’d look at that glass of water differently. It could become a kind of torture, to be forced to sit next to a glass of water, and not drink it, while slowly getting more and more thirsty. At some point, I might not be able to stand it, I’d drink the water, or leave, but not just sit there next to it slowly dying of thirst. If someone reaches out to me, I can quite easily shake their hand, and then let go. If I was falling, and someone reached out to me, I’d cling to their hand, potentially to the point of hurting them a bit. It’s possible for a man and a woman to be friends, if each one has an independent romantic and/or sexual life, and other friends, and family (blood or not), and so on. If their needs are generally being met. But if one of them is desperate? Then it’s going to be hard for them not to cling on to the only thing they have, or the only person they have. It’s natural for people to want more than just a friend.

Why don't people give the homeless a place to stay?
One word: FEAR. This chilling crime recently rocked the UK. Tracey Wilkinson with her son Pierce Wilkinson In March 2016, mother-of-two Tracey Wilkinson saw Aaron Barley shivering and trying to keep warm in a cardboard box outside of her local Tesco. Unable to just walk on by, she offered to drive Aaron to the council offices to help him get a place at a hostel. Although he was now in a hostel (with benefits), he still had little money or food, so she organised his breakfast and dinner each day. Sometimes this would be by inviting him over to her home to eat dinner with her family. Aaron said: “I just need somebody to give me a chance. I need somebody to give me a lucky break.” So her husband, Peter Wilkinson, found him a job in his manufacturing firm and he was then able to move into a flat of his own. Unfortunately, he took drugs and went off the rails. Managers reported high levels of absence and aggressive behaviour. He was let go, which then resulted in him being evicted from his flat. Mr Wilkinson found him asleep on their driveway so the family decided to try and help him again. They organised council housing for him, and paid for his accomodation themselves whilst this was being set up. He was even invited to spend Christmas Day with the family in their home. Afterwards, Aaron wrote Tracey a letter addressed ‘to the mother I never had’. In March 2017, one year after they had first met, Aaron crept back to the Wilkinson family home. The family’s CCTV showed that he laid in wait for several hours. Mr Wilkinson, as usual, left to take the dog for its morning walk. As usual, the back door was left unlocked (it is a safe neighbourhood (usually)) for this short period of time. This was when Aaron Barley striked. He stabbed Tracey and her 13-year-old son, Pierce, to death. When Peter Wilkinson returned 25 minutes later, he too was violently set upon. Unlike his wife and son, he was lucky enough to survive. Peter Wilkinson later explained (after a long recovery in hospital): “He said ‘Die, you bastard’ as he stuck the knife into me. I said to him after he’d stabbed me, ‘Aaron we tried to help you’, and he stuck the knife into my stomach and said ‘Die, you bastard’.” Aaron Barley then stole the family car and crashed it a short distance away, where he was arrested by the police. This was a major news story immediately. Lydia Wilkinson, Peter and Tracey’s elder child, was away at university. She found out about the tragedy by seeing it in the news, realising that it was in her hometown, and then realising that it was her home that was being pictured! She said she was warned to expect the worst and that for a time it looked like her father would not make it and that she would be left completely alone. Lydia Wilkinson Peter Wilkinson (right) with his children Pierce and Lydia To this day the motive remains a mystery. After all, the family had genuinely tried hard to help. However, the week before the killing, the family had decided to stop paying Aaron’s mobile phone bills. It is speculated that this may have been a trigger. Aaron Barley has shown no remorse. He said his only regret was that he did not succeed in killing the father, Peter Wilkinson. Aaron Barley Undoubtedly, he had had a terrible start in life. He was the product of incest. His mother and father were niece and uncle. He spent his childhood in numerous homes. But none of this can excuse the planned cold-blooded murder of those who had tried hardest to help him. “I wish my wife had never set eyes on him” - Peter Wilkinson.

What does reading a lot of books do to your mind?
This dot represents an idea. A line between dots represents a connection between ideas. Reading books gives your brain more dots to work with. Then, it helps you connect these dots. The more connections you have, the more you understand the world around you. Keep connecting the dots. Keep reading books.

What is the most creepy or paranormal thing you have experienced in your career as a police officer?
One night I was just leaving a home burglary call. I started driving and a neighbor lady flagged me down. She was at least 75 wearing a night gown. I stopped got out. She asked me if I wanted coffee. I said oh no thank you as she was walking to her porch. She said her son's were policemen. I watched her walk in and I said thank you but I have to go. She just kinda waved. So I got in started driving off and another guy about 45 stops me and says did they break into the Freeman house again? I said no your neighbor at the end of the culdesac got burglarized. He said why were you walking around the Freeman house. I said oh I was just talking to the lady who lived there. He said no one lives there. I said a lady lives there I just talked to her. He is freaking and says, Mrs Freeman died a year ago, the house has been boarded up. I'm telling the guy, no that house. He said yes that house is boarded up. So me and him walk back to the house and I shit you not, it is boarded up and dark. That turned me into a paranormal believer that day. There‘s no comments so I‘m asking here. Did you check if she actually had sons who were policemen? Yes the guy said all three of her Sons were Cops.

How do I make the decision to quit using drugs? I’ve had serious mental decline and I have become socially, and financially dysfunctional and now I feel like a fraction of who I was. I don’t even know who I am.
I tried to get clean for years. I just couldn’t do it. I would get a few days then I would just HAVE to use, I just couldn’t get through another day without changing the way I felt. I tried everything. But none of it worked. I know why. I wasn’t feeling enough pain when I used. I thought others were to blame for my life failings. I was full of self pity and resentments. Then a group of people changed that. They didn’t give me any sympathy. They all said over a week, that they ‘didn’t care.’ Then the lead psychiatrist saw me for a review. He smashed me. He ridiculed me. He threw my misery aside. He told me I was grandiose. That I was full of self pity. He didn’t want to listen to my tales of abuse. He gave my efforts to stay clean zero credit. I ended up running out of the room all the way home crying my heart out. Two years before he had removed me from a treatment programme. Then he made me jump through hoops to get another place. I was abused by others too. Even Quora people attacked. I was blocked from multiple spaces. I had nowhere left to run. The other guy told me I would want to run again. That I would feel great pain. I was reeling. I couldn’t work out why these people were punishing me. I was a good person! I had never done anyone harm! But something changed. Every time I used, I felt nothing but terrible distress. Every single time. I just couldn’t stop feeling utterly broken. And after 3 sessions of this agony, I stopped. I stayed clean for the longest period I had for 7 years. I did use again and it was awful. Now I’m not using. I’ve still got a lot of work to do. I’m hiding away and my thoughts are still full of self loathing and anger. But I’m seeing why I attracted so much hate. I’m seeing why I was so misunderstood! And I’m seeing how drugs made my personality such a target. So in short, if you want to get clean, you need to hear from someone the truth about your character that sits behind your substance abuse. I was told most addicts are self obsessed, self seeking, full of self pity, blaming others for their troubles, manipulative, insincere and holding a belief that they are special and different to other addicts. You need to feel so much pain, constant mental distress, enough to push you close to insanity, you need to have NO ONE to turn to who will feed you sympathy, you need to see just how defective you are. Your question indicates you might have the ‘poor me’ mindset. I’m going to visit your profile and see if you are as worthless as I had become. Only pain will set you free my friend.

If you live in a car, but your job needs a street address, what should you put?
My Quora followers will be absolutely shocked at this post… no matter, I’m glad to share these things! When I lived stateside and was down on my luck I suddenly found myself living in my car with only my clothes to my name. How did this happen? Well, my wife had found a lover, one day I came home early from work and he was in my house and she wasn’t, so I had him arrested for breaking and entering! Actually, this is an exceptionally hilarious story that I’ll save for another post… Anyway, I promptly left the house and went to a hotel. Because my wife was angry at what I’d done to her lover she blocked our bank accounts. I filed for divorce, but she hired a really good lawyer and the judge gave her everything. I got nothing but the car. Two weeks later I was laid off from a long-term and well-paying job, but because of the divorce I had very little money saved. So, suddenly I had a really big problem, but there was no one who could really help me, not even my family. I didn’t have enough money to get an apartment, so I started to sleep in my car. I knew that what I really needed was a permanent address, but in my sudden new position in life there was no way I could get one. Here’s what I did … I went to a post office (PO) box rental company and rented a box. Instead of putting down my address as “Box 12” when I was filling out a form, I put down “Unit 12”. Not once did I ever get a complaint from the mailbox company or the post office. All my mail arrived without a problem, including government mail. It’s a really good way to maintain a permanent address if you’re moving around a lot or are temporarily living in your car. It can even help you to improve your credit rating because it appears like you’re in a stable location for a period of time. The other thing that I did was I got a gym membership. I’d go to the gym every day to take a shower. The PO box cost me about $35 dollars a month, and the gym membership was about the same. So, for less than three dollars a day I was able to stay clean and appear, at least on paper and to everyone else, to be stable. I lived in my car for eight months before I was able to find a job and then another four months before I was able to save up enough money for first and last month’s rent and get myself into a small apartment. Would you believe that no one ever found me out? It’s true! No one ever knew! One of the first things I did after I got my PO box address was to try and get credit. Of course I was declined, but the address went on my credit rating nonetheless. I am absolutely sure that the apartment rental agency that I applied to wouldn’t have approved my rental application had I not tried to use the PO box’s address as my own to get credit a year earlier. To them it looked like I had lived for a year at my previous address and simply chose not to renew my lease. I even said as much when I was filling out my application. During that year I spent another ten dollars a week at the laundromat to keep my clothes clean, including the cost for laundry detergent. Toothpaste, soap and other incidentals cost me around thirty dollars a month. So basically my rent, water, electricity, laundry and personal grooming cost me about $150 a month, five dollars a day. During the time that I wasn’t working I’d go to various public parks around town and remove soda pop and beer cans from the garbage cans. When I had filled up the trunk of my car and then some, I went to the supermarket and put the cans in the recycling machines out front. I got a nickel for two cans and two cents for a single can. I was actually able to collect enough cans to pay the five dollars a day for my upkeep and also put two gallons of gas in my car so that I could drive around the next day. Incredibly, I was also able to collect enough cans to buy a liter of water and a package of Tang (powdered orange-flavored drink) every day. There was even enough left over for a Hostess dessert pie for breakfast, a 7-Eleven microwaveable burrito for lunch and some bread, ham, cheese and fruit for dinner! My food expenses were about seven dollars a day and it was about the same for gasoline. So, I lived on a budget of $20 dollars a day for nine months. Somehow, and I have no idea how, I was able to collect between 400 and 500 cans a day—and I survived! I have no shame in it, nor in sharing it; it wasn’t my fault to begin with, but in no way was I going to give up. I’m too proud. Sure, I could have sold my car to rent an apartment, but then how would I get to work or find a job? By bus? Not so practical in San Diego. So I did what I did in the way that I did it. Today, I have a house on the beach and I will buy a second one soon. I have a new wife whom I love and who loves me and we have a wonderful son together. I’ve worked for 11 years at the same company, so my life is stable once again. But I’ll never forget that year; it was a true life lesson. And you know what? It wasn’t so bad living in my car collecting cans so that I could get through the day! Get a PO box, get a gym membership, maintain a prepaid cellular line so people can call you, try to get credit, do what you need to do to find the $20 to $30 dollars a day you need and in the end you’ll be just fine! Good luck! Cheers! EDIT: My fellow Quorans! OMG! Thank you for your wonderful comments and support!

I'm not a guy but I also don't get really horned up from smoking it. Probably because of the antidepressants I'm on, Zoloft. It kills your sex drive, I have to make myself stay in that zone and if something fucks it up like the cat meowing because she wants more temptations, or the dude I'm with says something funny, I lose my interest and it sucks cause I used to love sex and I still do, just too many things that interfere in my shitty living situation.

27 y/o here and a physician. My there are two chairs in my therapist’s office(for the clients,not him), I used to sit on a spesific chair for 1.5 years then one day he instructed me to sit on the other one (he was working on my a certain issue and decided to start on that particular day🥲), I felt uncomfortable at all and that was the worst session we have ever had!

27 years old here and a physician. Yeah, I did for the first time after 1.5 years with the same therapist (Whome I’m in good terms with). That day I was telling him about a feeling I just recongnised which is abandment by my parents but he did not seem to get what I was talking about and to make it worse he told me that its to late to have this sort of feelings and that I’m not a baby to need them! And with a smile on his face he still had the audacity to ask me if I was (Not okay)? I could not get more frustrated or angrier at that moment. So yeah, I did left, I simply asked him to stop here and that I can’t keep up with this session which we were only (13 min) into. I sat in my car crying for a good time and I went into a panic attack, My migraine started to get the best of me as well to to…

Have you ever locked yourself in a bathroom, cried, washed your face, and come back as nothing has happened? Why? And why do you go to the bathroom to cry?
Yes I did! I was at work when my boyfriend of over 5 years broke up with me🥺. I locked myself in the bathroom, cried, washed my face and came back to my seat like nothing happened. It hurts, still hurts😔.

You must go see a psychiatris. Simple as that. ASAP. and plse dont hurt the baby. It never did anything to harm you. He probably thinks you're cute and nice to. And you'd go to jail.

Be decent enough to know when your not happy and leave. Why cause more heartache and problems when you could literally just walk away from the relationship and then you are free to do whatever you please when ever you please and guess what … you don’t hurt a person that you once cared for dearly!

Can antidepressants really help ease or cure depression?
Absolutely!
If a pers…
In my opinion there is no harm in trying antidepressants if you have been diagnosed with depression and other pathways of treatment don't seem to be improving your condition then it seems that trying medication could benefit you and if it doesn't or you don't like them the medication that you have been prescribed you can always change it or stop the medication all together and no harm has been done and alternatively if the medication has positive effects you now have a tool that you can use in managing your illness and on help you on your road to recovery.
Hope everything goes…

Can antidepressants really help ease or cure depression?
Absolutely! If a person had a kidney problem no one would question why they are receiving dialysis. There is no difference for a person with depression and their reasoning for taking antidepressants. Both are medical treatments prescribed to patients by medical professionals. The main difference being that mental illness and medications associated with it have a stigma, which therefore makes people question their necessity. In my opinion there is no harm in trying antidepressants if you have been diagnosed with depression and other pathways of treatment don't seem to be improving your condition then it seems that trying medication could benefit you and if it doesn't or you don't like the medication that you have been prescribed you can always change it or stop the medication all together and…

What do I say to the doctors if I'm depressed?
Tell them honestly how you've been feeling lately and that it's getting in the way of your daily life and preventing you from doing things that you would usually. The doctor will then ask you a few questions and you've just got to make sure that you are being completely honest so that you can be helped properly and in a way that will actually benefit you. You're being really brave speaking to your doctor about this because I know it can seem very scary, but you've got nothing to worry about because what you are telling your doctor is something that they have dealt with many times so they know how to help you and also aren't going to be shocked by what you're telling them, so there's no need to worry! Remember that your health is the most important thing so go take care of yourself, good luck…

If I took 30mg of generic Adderall XR 15-16 hours ago, would it be safe to take 15mg now?
As with every situation viewed on a clinical level, I’d say “it depends”.
Assuming it’s 15mg IR and you’re prescribed both. Did your doctor give you the extra 15mg as a booster for the afternoon? I’d say yes totally safe ONLY if that’s the case. Just have a snack and some water before you take the 15.
BUT If someone gave you the 15mg or you got it from someone you don’t know; however, I would use extreme caution. Fentanyl is often found in “street” adderall.

True story! I’ve almost reached out to Teva myself through a work colleague who has a son that works for them! I’m convinced their patent expired and they don’t manufacture the same formula inherited from Barr anymore :(

I can no longer find Teva and I only took Teva for 20 years!! Walgreens was my go-to but ever since this shortage, I’m luck to find any pharmacy with the amount and dose I take :( some generics make me sick, suicidal, sleepy or give me a migraine. Have you been able to get Teva since the end of 2023?

Any one experience chest discomfort after starting Adderall IR? I feel sort of tightness and almost a hot/cold feeling that doesn't quite hurt but uncomfortable. Everything online says its an emergency.
Adderall is a vasoconstrictor and does have an effect on your parasympathetic nervous system. I would definitely recommend getting checked out by a professional asap and have a EKG done. Also, I recommend talking to your doctor at the very least about these effects!

propranolol should have very minimal side effects honestly. I was always afraid to take it out of fear for my super low blood pressure. I’m on the lowest dose and it’s fast acting. Will take my heart rate down from 90’s to 60’s or 70’s within minutes.

You’re on Bactrim with no specific diagnosis?
only reason I say it like that is because Bactrim is a sulfa drug and it’s known to cause an upset stomach…antibiotic resistance is real. I can take ONE antibiotic that I know of.

Ivy went for a trip and sent 3/5 of her money on gas for her car. She spent 1/2 of the remaining money for lunch and spent Php250 for lunch. How much money did she have before she left?
Before lunch ivy had twice as much as the money she's left with, so Php 250×2=Php500(after sending money on gas). She's left with Php500 after sending 3/5 of her money, which means Php 500 is 2/5 of the original amount(1–3/5=2/5)
X × 2/5 = 500
X = 500 ×5/2
X = 1250
So initially Ivy had Php1250
Hope this helps 😊

How do you 'park' thoughts and move on? Everything is whirring round in my head and I can't do it.
A 1year 7month old situation which has deteriorated along the line keeps tormenting me till this day. Sometimes I feel insane and want to take my life. But this is how I’ve learnt to deal w them
•Accepting the fact that it will not just go away, so i do not beat myself up for having those episodes
•Being optimistic. Seeing the brighter side of things
•PLaying silent music
•Praying

Have you ever let your life get out of control and then regain your footing and get yourself together and what helped?
My education Used to be a smart child but in elemtary my performance began to deteriorate In year9, I received a message from God from his servant (a prophecy) about my education and how God was going to bless me in that field. He didn’t know anything about it. It boosted my confidence because before that I believed i was a failure and couldnt ever do well because i was always part of the dumbest people in class no one in my life believed in me. I’m currently a law student on my way to become a lawyer in about 5years. It still shocks people how far i heve come and the journey, even after the prophecy hasnt been easy. I had to drop out of Sixth form in the beginning of the academic year and start the whole year because of some set back. Even after i started sixth form again, i faced a lot of…

I am 24 years old and I left my university. I didn't tell my parents I’m so scared. What should I do?
Find the courage to tell them
Not only that… but tell and assure them of the things you’re working towards. Make sure you’re working towards something because if you’re not in Uni then you have to have something to prove to them that you’re determined.
I don’t know why you chose to drop out but let them know why you did, how it affected you and how you’re determined to compensate your decision by working hard on something else from now. Find the strength in yourself to do this I know you can

What are the ways to control overthinking and overanalyzing?
These are what I try to do
-optimism
-calm myself with videos to cheer me up or silent music
-reminding myself that worrying won’t change the problem, but taking control and actually approaching it will
-reminding myself that the pictures And scenarios I create in my mind is not reality. Things are much more different in our thoughts than in reality.

Should I even try to improve myself or my life? Everything, everyone around me, and even myself seems to tell me that I will fail, but I still don't want to live a miserable life as a failure. Should I give up?
I’ve been dealing with this too and I’m totally ‘on my own’.
But be your own strength when everyone is against you. Don’t give up
The fear of failure keeps us away from great possibilities. Imagine if Steve Harvey, Oprah and more gave up and did not press on. Follow your desires and find good opportunities even though they’re not easy to come across
But pls don’t give up
Be optimistic

That’s too much sensory details for an INTJ. The descriptions would likely come from a sensor than an intuitive.

Has your physical appearance ever affected your dating life?
Not only my dating life, but many other aspects, including my self-steem. I have always concidered myself an average-looking person. When I look at myself in the mirror I always hate the image I see, there are so many things on my body I do not like. However, I know people around me consider me beautiful, specially because my skin tone and hair is different than the rest (here in Mexico) and (I won´t lie) because I have a big butt. It has affected me both ways, negatively and possitively. In the dating world my appearance has helped me greatly. I can get any man I want, they all see interested and no one has ever said “no” to me. The downside to that, is that some of them are more interested on my looks than me as a person, and that hurts! I have a tons of insecurities, but for some reason peo…

I regret saying something I shouldn't. What should I do?
There will always a time in life when we say something we later regret. No one is exempt from it. The good thing is that you already accepted that you did wrong and you want to mend your mistake. Talk to the person, even if he/she doen´t accept your apology, you´ll get it off your chest and will feel better about it. Be honest. If you said something wrong because of anger, let them know that you truly don´t think that way, but said it out of spite. Anger often blinds us and we end up saying stupid things just because we want to hurt the other person. If you said something out of ignorance (like a homophobic, racist, sexist remark) tell the person that you´re sorry for being unimformed and assure them that it will never happen again. Remember, focus on the person, avoid making it about you, even…

Has anybody ever done something against their own morals, why?
Hell yes I did, and up to this day I still feel ashamed of my behaviour, but in NO way I regret what I did. I dated a married man who ended up leaving his wife for me. Being a upright person, I surprised myself when I let myself go. We started off as friends, but as time passed something clicked between us. By that time I was suffering from a harsh depression episode and he lent me a hand, payed for my therapist and medication when I was short on money (Even though I´d always deny it) and was there when I felt I had no one else to rely on. More importantly, he focused on more than my appearance, he strived to know me as a person instead of getting me to bed (which for me was very relieving because I had resently ended a relatonship that felt relied only on my looks and sexuality). He treated…

I'm sure my ex has Aspergers, however he is an extremely touchy-feely person and loves to gaze eye to eye. Does this negate the possibility of Aspergers?
This is a very odd question. Like can’t you just move on instead of trying to diagnose your ex with something you probably know very little of. If you are trying to help i understand, if not just move on and forget. If he was comfortable with it he would be telling you. Would you like your ex seaching up trying to diagnose you with a look downed by society syndrome because how you acted?

Why do some people say that vaccination can cause autism in kids?
Because they are not willing to spend 0.0001% of their life to read and understand that asperger/autism can't be developed, you are born with it. Those people exist everywhere in every community. If you hear someone say that and you are unsure, move along and find the truth yourself from reliable sources.

Can autistic adults purchase houses?
Yes autistic adults can purchase a house. I would recommend you do some research on what autism/asperger actually is. We are not mentally retarded we are just wired different from birth that makes us a little bit different in the brain that makes some of us think different. Also remember like every regular person, aspergers are different people.

That was complete bullshit. When i was little i ate fuck ton of ice cream and loved it. Autism is not some code that is put in our brains at birth to make us be all the same.

Why does my mom refuse me to play video games?
Lack of knowledge. Yes Video games has a lot of bad things to offer like brutal language, bullying, violence. But if you play the right video games with the right people you can learn skills that is more than needed in the professional world. Like communication, teamwork, working towards a goal, needing to think to figure things out etc. And video games can be fun and relaxing, when you come home from school video games can help your brain relax which is super important if you are having a stressfull day. I suggest you find information on the internet about these things and let your mother learn the positive sides of playing video games. Good luck!

How do I recognize a person (both genders) with autism at first glance?
You can’t. Autism is a mental disorder not a physical one. Sometimes you may not even know people have aspergers/autism until they told you. But alot of people have signs of autism that you can easily spot after spending some time with them. I suggest you research what autism truly is and common behaviors for people with autism if you really wanna spot them for whatever personal reason.

You're suddenly trapped in the room you're currently in. You're stuck there for a month. How do you survive?
My bedroom, since it’s on the first floor i mean like it’s simple i just call my family and ask them to send food and water through my window(or the airway if window is not possible) . Maybe some snacks and nicotine dip too if im lucky.
Then i will go on the computer and chill for a month. Probably exercising body strength too.
And if noone can access my room i will measage my family saying i love the them and wishing them a last goodbye. Then make some friends on the internet and have a great last time.

What does .TV stand for in a URL?
Alot of people might think it stands for television. What it really stands for is the island country Tuvalu, that is east for Papua Ny-Guinea. Why it's seen so common on the internet is because a big amount of entertainment companies have bought the rights to use .tv.

Here in Norway: No guns allowed and we had the only 2 shooting episodes one in 2012 and before that in the 90s. We also get free health care and medical attention. Our kings role is to represent our country, the leadership is by goverment. Our “old” buildings is not nececary needed be to rebuild as most look modern inside. Why do we need guns when there is no thread? I mean like there is crimes but you would most likely increase the crimes with guns. Not even police officers is not wearing a firearm because they self said they did not need it.

What are the health consequences of abusing inhalants?
This is my story and to be honest I really don’t know the answer. I can’t find any data or after effects of inhalants but I really do believe I have them. Here is my story.. At 20 I used inhalants for 3 months heavily. I became addicted in 3 months. At the time I was using drugs but was really at my rock bottom. I moved back in with my parents I had no keys eventually,no phone,on lockdown till I got my shit together. I became desperate as the addict I was. I started using air duster and the high was something I cannot even describe in words other than going to a totally different dimension feeling this rush all over your body. Escaping reality. Actually leaving. For a moment. sounds so nice except once you become addicted your family finds you passed out in the car,or in your room,or whereve…

I can relate. With me though I have different circles of friends. I was forced by my environment to be like this when I was in high school. It was hard to have close friends so I would attach myself to groups that I can blend in with and be invisible at the same time. So like currently, I have lots of friends, but only a handful of close friends. I call the majority fillers or acquaintances. But there's one specific set of friends that I enjoy hanging out with. They're the opposite of my personality. Always upbeat and positive and fun to be around. So when I feel like I need a break from the solitary life, I wish to hang out with them, but they're mostly not available these days. And that's very bad for me. In times like these I'd feel so alone like there's no one else in my life. And yeah, I wish it wasn't like this. I should be able to have fun with whichever friend, but the universe has denied me this.

Do you know what I like about you? Your honesty. Not many people can mention how they had behaved and all that. Some will try to pretty up the words or make some bad experience sound like it was good. But with you, you just say it as it is. And my heart goes out to you. And I can say to you with confidence, that you have taken your first step in healing. It starts with acknowledgment. And don't worry too much about the drama that surrounds you now. Everything in life is there to teach us lessons. Sometimes it seems all negative. But we must find the strength to see beneath the negatives and pull the positive from it. Even if it is as small as a mustard seed. If you focus on that, it will grow into a mountain. But you must believe in yourself. People will always speak their opinion. Sometimes it's not out of hatred but out of bad experiences. And it does good to them for speaking out. It is up to each person how they choose to either absorb it and feel terrible or to understand and see things from a different perspective and turn it into a lesson. Again, I commend you for trying to be better. And it's good that your special someone has sparked and inspired you so much. But you know what, you must find that inspiration from within yourself. Because if things doesn't work out and that person lets you down, you'll feel worse than you felt before and you'll start the same negative cycle as before. So just keep believing in yourself. Once you start seeing things in a more positive light, you'll thank yourself for trying. And that will even motivate you to push on. It's about you and nobody else.

Have you ever dated someone who was nosy and needed to know everything about past relationships in your life?
I am not sure if this is something most persons do when they start dating someone, but I was in a relationship and marriage with a narc, and I had to outline every detail of my past sex life. And I had to do so more than once. I think when potential partners ask questions like these it's to see how big of a competition they have. And of course, sometimes after having sex, he would ask me if he was better. (Face palm) I think it is okay to some extent that some persons ask about past sex life, but they pass the limit when they keep comparing themselves to your exes. That's just stepping over the boundary. And even though it is a relationship, you still have your own privacy. What if you had some bad experiences with an ex and you had to relive the pain and hurt by recalling your sexual experie…

Hahaha. You're too funny. But really, were you trying to be different for yourself? Or for someone else? Don't be too hard on yourself. You didn't ask to be a narc. There's so much things that influence that behaviour in many humans. Just take your time, and think of how it would benefit you to evolve into a better version of yourself. It is possible, but it will take time. Based on what i understood from your comment, you're saying that you weren't the controlling type. That's good for you. Means you are not at the level where other narcs are that really is too overwhelming to deal with. But don't give up. Personal discovery and growth is very important to the self. All the best on your self journey.

Is kissing a healthy way of sharing love?
I will say yes.
Because of the feelings that you get when kissing the person you love. It's amazing and leaves you feeling closer than you were before you started kissing.
I'm talking about the kiss that doesn't lead to anything sexual. Just a nice deep passionate kiss. It's an expression of love between two people where words fail to communicate the real feelings. One that comes from your heart and even from the depths of your soul.

Did you fall in love again deeply after moving on from a really special and deep relationship with your ex and u thought back then u would never find someone like him/her but turnedout eventually that u found someone even way better in every aspects?
Definitely. When it comes to the heart, we have the ability to love again and even deeper after our heart gets broken. It honestly is still surprising for me. Because I found myself thinking that I could never find another like my ex while I was with him, only to actually fall in love after we broke up and even had a closer bond with this person. It is even to the point where I wish I had met this person long ago, because I would have avoided the heartbreak from my ex.
All I can say about this is that we are extraordinary beings. We just need to be open to change and not let our bad experiences keep us locked in a dungeon in our past.
Everything is possible, once we put focus in it. Once we decide we'll keep going despite the issues that arise in our life.

Do narcissists ever regret the neglect they showed their partners after they separate? Do they long for the days where they were cared for so well? Do they not even remember what they threw away by being selfish self-centered narcissistic sociopaths?
Hahaha. This is a funny question, because I do believe it's true. Especially if they don't end up with someone who treated them like you had treated them. But this feeling won't come to them until after some time. But I don't think it is that they miss you that much. It's the feeling of empowerment they feel having someone like you. They really are powerless when there's no one to feed their egos. Very powerless. So it is in those down times they will wish you were still there. It's not about love or companionship. Consider a drug addict how he's addicted to the high he gets when he takes a hit. That's the same high a narc feels when he is in a relationship with a pleaser or an empath. The day they start feeling like they genuinely miss someone that deeply and genuinely is the day they'll be c…

I can't cry anymore. I've tried everything to force myself to do so. Nothing works. What should I do?
I may not have experienced the depth of hurt you're feeling but I can say the I have experienced my fair share of hurt to the point where I've thought of ending my life. I went as far as telling a friend how I wanted my funeral to be. I also wrote my letter and researched the most painless way to die. I was ready to just give up because the pain was just too much. But I could not take the steps to do it. I thought about the persons in my life that depended on me, the ones that looked up to me, the ones that love me and the ones I love. I realized that it would hurt me even more to cause them so much pain. That would be selfish and I can't think only of myself like that.

If you break up with somebody is there any chance to remain only friends?
If she is really special to you, then in order to remain in a healthy friendship with her, you have to ensure you keep your emotions under control. The first thing to do is accept that you two can't be together. It will be easier if your relationship ended on good terms like it was a mutual decision for whatever reason. You have to acknowledge that you will face lots of challenges. Like when she moves on with another partner: can you stand the heat? Can you be happy for her without giving her bad advice because you don't want her to move on? When she is talking to other males or that she's not giving you as much attention as when you two were together. And this really can't be your decision only. If the decision to remain friends isn't mutual, it will be more hurtful. Again it goes back to how…

Does it really take years to get past a narc relationship? Or can I get over it quickly?
It really is a different experience for everyone. But you can always start with rebuilding your self-esteem and self-confidence. Be grateful that you are finally out of that toxic environment and try to see your life as a blessing. Your emotional and mental health is the most important thing to focus on. Once your mind is healthy, it will show physically. You'll attract more positive things in your life. For me, October 2020 will mark 1 year since I've been divorced from my narc husband. I feel that I am in a better place mentally now than I was when things just ended. The thing that kept me going was the freedom I felt when it finally ended, like a breath of fresh air that I was finally able to take. I just try not to think about him. And even though he sent an email earlier in the year sayi…

What do you do when you seriously don't think you're good enough for your partner, and know that eventually they will figure this out and leave you?
That's low self-esteem and low self-confidence speaking. Remember that sometimes how we see ourselves is not how our partners see us.
If you're really feeling that they'll leave you because of this, then it's time to make a plan to uplift yourself, not for your partner, but for your own self and peace of mind.
Have a heart to heart with your partner. Tell of your fears. Assure your partner that you want to focus a bit more on yourself and it doesn't mean you're going to ingore them or love them less. If your partner supports you, you stay with them. If not, they're the one not deserving you.
But really though, you should work on the reasons why you feel like you're not good enough.
That will definitely improve how you view yourself.
Hope this helps.

Have you ever caught your spouse cheating on you in your own home? How did you deal with it?
This has not happened to me before, but I've watched videos online and read other's experiences to know that it's best to avoid the drama. The discovery is the best thing that could ever happen. Because you won't be living a lie anymore. What to do, leave. Don't even confront them. It's not worth it. You caught them and it's obvious, so why should you go through all that stress of confrontation and more lies. Not worth it at all. Get out and move on with your life. One video I watched was with this guy who caught his wife cheating on him. One day she came home and saw that he had decorated the entire place romantically. Rose petals on the ground and all that. He went all out with the romance, so she was feeling extremely good and maybe guilty. He had packed all his things and was waiting to leav…

So many of us understand your pain and I'm so sorry that you're going through it. From someone that has made attempts, it took more than medication to help. TMS saved my life. That was the start of it, followed by medication changes and different therapies. It's not a quick fix, but I have more good days than bad.

I would love to believe that I could function without my meds. My psychiatrist believes in minimal medication and a structured lifestyle, with therapy, so we've been working on that. I'm considered a severe case of bipolar 1 with multiple suicide attempts. It's taken a hell of a lot of work, but I'm down to a few medications. I will probably always have to at least take a mood stabilizer.

I don't know if it's all areas, but in my county, they have a notation on my address that I am bipolar and have attempted suicide. EMS told that means anytime an ambulance is called to my house, cops are required to be here first.

The question should be..do Koreans respect themselves? Dogs, cats, pigeons, the kids they traffic, ..I can go on and on. They are subhuman to me. Always will be. Personally they lack respect for any and EVERYONE of all races. . Any race that cares to be in their circle..or that would let their guard down when it comes to them would be the biggest joke in my book.

This is a crazy one, so bear with me. I was dating a married man for 2 years. His wife found out about 8 months ago and we since have ended it. He decided to work on his marriage. I was heartbroken at first but I’m moving on. It’s been long enough that I feel like I’m in a better place and everything has been good. Yesterday, I got a call from him. It is the first time I’ve heard from him. He said his wife has been receiving emails from me and he wanted them to stop. I was dumbfounded because I have NOT tried contacting her at all… I’ve had to block her numerous times actually because she keeps finding new ways to contact me. I told him repeatedly that it wasn’t me, I don’t even know her email address. If I did, I would have blocked it by now because of how often she tries to contact me, but he isn’t convinced. I asked him to tell me the email address they were coming from and to read some of the emails. Once he did, there was no doubt in my mind that his wife has created this email address and has been writing them posing them as me. I’ll spare the details, they were graphic and said horrible things…. but just know that I’m 100% certain that she wrote them. I can’t make him believe me, so I notified state police that someone was doing this and they said they would subpoena the email address and see what information they could get. The police didn’t seem very interested honestly, I got the feeling they thought my call was a waste of time. Is there anything else I can do?
They aren't interested in this because they probably feel like you signed up for drama. You were sleeping with someone that was married. Do you actually feel as though the wife shouldn't give you a little hell? She's playing her hand now..and that is making you look like a psycho so that her husband can NEVER LOOK BACK. Hey, you get what you give. Unfortunately if you would sleep with someone that's married, how can you go to the police playing the integrity game? The mistress should be real familiar with karma, deceit, scandal, lies, words in that family.
You ran her husband. No judging, but I do believe in karma. And the whole you do dirt you get dirt. I would leave it alone. Accept your karma and I believe once you pay your debt to karma, God will bring you your own husband.

Morally, should a married man still be in dating sites?
Married man / Dating site. What's wrong with that line? He's up to no good for sure. I would probably assume he has a fetish, a hidden type that's the opposite race, or size, height, sex, or age of his wife. Such an unfortunate thing to go thru I'm sure. But it may be time to visit a divorce lawyer. Its probably going to end less favorable for the wife anyways be it now or later.

If and when you really know In your Heart that you have nothing left to give, release them. Let them find what they need and you deserve to be happy as well. Life is too short. I think that while until death do us part is exploited and if one of the parties happens to fall out of love or no longer wish to remain married, they are viewed as scum. No, we deserve happiness. Who the hell wants to be on their deathbed unhappy, unfulfilled and full of regrets? Not me.

I got cheated on and now he's married to another woman and I don't know if he regrets it or not. What do I do now?
I've been thru something similar very recent. This is what I immediately let sink in right away to grieve, deal with it, move on and get on with my life. Number one, you probably don't even cross his mind, he chose where he wanted to be, and its not with you. Sucks, I know. But so true. Two, just because he cheated on you does not mean he is the scum of the earth. Could he possibly just be human? Made a mistake ? And maybe the mistake was the relationship that was ended when he found his true love? Or soul mate? And maybe he never wanted to hurt you, but his heart was pulled in another direction? Again, none of those things will make you jump for joy, but own what it is, or what it could be so you can understand what's set in motion to occur from here. Close your eyes and imagine YOUR TRUE…

I can't stop making myself throw up after I've eaten too much, (out of guilt and also want to make myself comfortable), how can I stop?
You should go and speak to someone because it sounds like you are bulimic. Don't be afraid to speak someone, it will help you. Bulimia is dangerous and can cause so many problems for your body. If you feel guilty after eating too much, maybe try eating less. Eat healthy foods that fill you up. If I were you I would see a therapist and also see a nutrionist so you can find the best foods to eat and come up with a meal plan.

How do I not feel bad about how many people I've slept with?
Don't feel bad. There is a reason why you slept with those people, at the moment you must've wanted to sleep with them. Looking back at it, you might regret it. But it is not healthy to look back at the past and get upset. We can't change what we have done, but we can change what we do. If you are already upset with how many people you've slept with, maybe don't sleep with many more. Live your life, use protection, get tested, be happy. It doesn't make you any less of a person, doesn't mean you Don't care about yourself, doesn't mean anything bad about you. ITS OKAY!

I honestly think that I have an anxiety disorder but I'm scared to ask for professional help. What should I do especially that it's getting worse?
Even though you might be scared to ask for professional help, it's worse to live with anxiety. I don't know what is making you scared to get help, but I promise it is worth it. you shouldn't have to live your days with constant anxiety, it's hard. I get really bad panic attacks and I couldn't imagine if I wasn't able to take something to calm it down. it might take some time to find the right doctor, someone who can really help but that's how it goes with everything. I hope you get help because it is very hard and scary to live while always having anxiety attacks or panic attacks. I wish you the best of luck.

Are drug addicts to blame for their addiction?
Because usually it is prescription pills that start the addiction. Start off with pills and eventually the pills no longer cause the high they desire, so they move onto street drugs.

What does it feel like to be in constant physical pain?
I have Been in chronic pain for over six years, with no relief. I am not going to get into what pain I have. Living in chronic pain affects a person physcially and mentally. It is draining physically and mentally. you start to lose hope, you can't figure out what's wrong with you, and you wonder if you'll ever live pain free. I do my best to live my life, to enjoy life, but it is hard when you are living in pain. i do not feel sorry for myself, and I don't like getting sympthay from people. It is what it is, maybe one day I will be pain free and maybe one day I won't.

Why do I not dream anymore?
Everyone has dreams every night. It is believed that we have about three different dreams every night. Some people remember their dreams, some people don't. Just because you don't remember your dream, doesn't mean you didn't dream. We always are while asleep.

Have you spoken to a doctor about it? If you snorted drugs for ten years, I'm sure the damage that has been made won't get better. \U0001f62c

Has your drug-snorting addiction caused you to lose your sense of smell?
I've never snorted drugs, but it is common for that to happen after long use of snorting drugs. You cause a lot of damage when you snort drugs which leads to many problems such as the ones you listed

What is the level of pain when getting a hand tattoo?
Hands are supposed to be among one of the worst places to get a tattoo. It's probably going to hurt like hell, but if you want the tattoo then it's worth the pain. Just remember that hand tattoos fade more easily also since you're constantly washing your hands. You will have to get a touchup more often

What is the most painful thing you’ve endured?
I took care of my grandmother for last two years. I was with her every day. Taking care of her meant I was in charge of her medication, I took her to her doctor appointments, changed her, helped her in the bathroom, etc. she was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, and in August she was in the hospital for a few days. When I got her back home, she was completely bed bound. She went on hospice, but I still took care of her. I gave her her comfort meds that we were given through hospice, I changed her diapers, I changed her sheets with her still laying in bed. She's my favorite person in the world so I loved every single minute of it. She started to get worse, she would be confused, get agitated, see people who weren't there, stopped eating and drinking, she was going through the process o…

I have blurry visions, followed by headache and vomiting. This events occurs suddenly and is hampering my work. What might be the reason or disease?
You could be having a migraine which is extremely painful. You should see a doctor, they will do an MRI to make sure there's no tumor, no aneurysm, or anything else that would cause it. If your MRI comes back clean, they will most likely say you're having migraines and put you on medication. They will probably also do a routined blood test to make sure that's normal as well. I know the pain is unbearable, and the symtpsoms symptoms are scary. Do your best to not freak out, everything will be okay.

It could be a migraine, with migraines you can hear sounds. There is also a different type of headache which is hearing loud sounds, but I don't remember what they are called. If you're concerned about it you should see a neurologist if it is something that happens often and you aren't able to get the pain under control

Why is it that sometimes you have a headache in a certain part of the head?
There are many different type of headaches. Cluster headaches, tension headaches, stress headaches, and then there are migraines. Depending on what type of headache you're having it affects a different part of your head. Headaches and migraines are two different things. Migraines are more severe, and have different symptoms associated with them. A migraine usually affects one part of side of your head, your left or your right. But that's not always the case.

Yes, I have personally built a tolerance to pain. Suffering for chronic pain helps you do that. Everyone's pain tolerance is different. People who live in cold weather for along time will get used to it after time as well.

How do you move on after someone doing something terrible to you and getting no consequences to their actions?
You never truly do move on, it’s a very difficult thing to accept. In a situation like this, most people tend to fixate and obsess over what was done to them. It’s extremely unhealthy. Of course I don’t know the severity nor do I know your relationship with this person but try to keep your distance or better yet, cut off contact with them altogether. Just don’t let it consume you. Try your best to keep busy and keep living your life. Time heals all wounds, just take it one day at a time. I truly hope things get better for you and eventually you find peace …

I'm definitely nervous, but I think I can handle it. English: AP ENGLISH LITERATURE I am not an English person. I've gotten straight Bs in Honors English and AP Lang. Not to say I'm not excited but the thought of reading Wuthering Heights after not being able to Jane Eyre. I know the teacher gives a shit ton of work. I've talked to her because of National Honor Society applications, but I'm absolutely terrified of her. Math: PRE-CALCULUS HONORS Math… is also not my strong suit.

As a student, what is the saddest thing you have found out about your teacher?
This last year, I had a geometry teacher. His class was so simple and easy, until we started getting into the more difficult stuff. Quickly, my grade was tanking, along with everyone else. One day, he starts missing a lot of class. We were all really worried, as he always loved teaching and being there. Some people were angry, of course. He was testing us on difficult stuff, and he wasn't there to teach it. I was among those who were angry. One day, he comes into class with jaundiced eyes and told us to do anything. He let us take two lunches that day. I was confused, as I was the only one who really noticed. He wasn't back in school for a couple weeks, and then he posted a video on YouTube for us called ""Do you best under less than perfect conditions"". There, he announced he had stage 3 panc…

Don't know if this meant for high school students, but here I go. -High school courses- AP English Language & Composition - I consider myself a decent writer, as does the teacher for the class, so I was recommended for the course. English has typically been one of my best subjects, but that's recently shifted to science and history. My only B for most of my freshman year was in English; my hopes are I don't fail the AP exam. AP World History - As I mentioned before, history has been one of my best classes. I excelled in AP Human Geography, so my teacher recommended me for world! I'm worried that the new curriculum and exam are gonna freak me out, but I think I'll do okay. I am a history fanatic, and I'm quite excited for the new WHAP teacher*. *Note: at my high school, there was a recent chang…

How did you do on the 2019 AP tests?
As I took my first AP, I think I did decently well. I got an A in the class with a four on the actual exam. I was a little disappointed; I was really expecting a five. The class was a breeze for me. It was quite honestly one of my favorite classes this year. I expect myself to do better on my two exams next year. I'm taking AP lang and world. Two classic, not easy classes.

Hi Kathleen I understand your situation my brother is psychotic and schizophrenic he smokes weed to. He is very angry and gets into trouble and has another court hearing soon . He won’t listen to no one it is devastating to our family especially our elderly mother. We are not now thinking of reporting him to the police so he can be accessed as this is the only way to get him into hospital.

Google ‘Gastroschisis’ and it will answer your questions about living with intestines outside the body! I worked on a neonatal surgical unit years ago where one of the most common birth defects we saw was babies born with their intestines outside their body. The cure for it is surprisingly simple: their intestines are hung up in a bag above them and gravity slowly does it’s work! After a while they end up back inside their abdomen and they need surgery to seal up the hole left in their abdomen (and sometimes to push the final bits in).

Do you recommend electroconvulsive therapy for bipolar or depression?
Hi, I’m a mental health nurse. I will tell you about the one experience I had caring for a patient who underwent ECT. The patient was transferred to us shortly after the ECT sessions finished and he arrived in a catatonic state- which means he was almost paralysed- due to the extent of his depression. Please note he was catatonic prior to ECT this was not a result of the treatment. Prior to his ECT he was extremely suicidal, but being catatonic meant he was unable to function in any way, and as an extension carry out any of his plans to kill himself. After his ECT as the days and weeks went by he finally began moving, then walking, then showing emotion on his face, then talking and then smiling. Before we knew it he was running around laughing and smiling and talking at a million miles an hour…

I’m a specialised eating disorder nurse, when we have a patient admitted onto our inpatient unit we start them on very small portions as little as 5–10calories/kg/day to prevent refeeding syndrome as well as providing them with vitamin supplements to boost their electrolyte levels. We follow the MARSIPAN guidelines as do most UK based inpatient eating disorder units (I can’t speak for other countries). You can read through the guidelines online there is a section on refeeding syndrome.

It’s called refeeding syndrome and it’s a very serious risk when helping an anorexic person recover. If they eat too much food too quickly their phosphate, magnesium and potassium electrolytes get quickly used up which can cause serious complications such as comas or heart attacks. So refeeding syndrome is caused by an increase in calories too quickly for their bodies to handle. Essentially, if you give an anorexic person a massive burger and a pile of chips it could actually cause refeeding syndrome and kill them.

Ive had Physcosis for a little over two years now. It started when I was at a girlfriends house and was in a great state of mind. I remember casually saying to her “this feels like a dream”. Now it’s turning into a nightmare, Ive tried everything I can think of. I smoke weed whenever I get my hands on it because it helps me feel better about feeling “detached”. Is normal/okay?
Self medicating not a good idea for psychosis , it ma help in short term but better off seeing Dr when u feel ready too , don't mind idiots on here who cry about spelling , they are far from perfect themselves or wouldn't be here lol tell em to fk off if they don't want to help 😉

I agree , I tried to give a friend 10 dai to get him interested in crypto , to transfer10 dai from my trust wallet it wanted £600 n miners fees those dai will sit there forever and I'm buying cardano as and when I can its pumped £0.12 today at 69 pence each must be around a dollar , I only have 70 cardano due to being skint on disability, but will keep buying them when I can , its a much better newer coin without eth fees ,I borrowed £10 of eth from a friend to pay fees,he never looked at the sending fees i received 2.80 also news of coinbase moving onto cardano platform due to people avoiding eth fees which will put cardano price up , no braner for me !

I love my 30yr old wooden stocked ruler got end screwed for a silencer, for the price its a great gun usually use it for shooting rabbits only thing is 30 shot banana magazine,using cheap subsonic for rabbits ,the bullets are very waxy and after 20 odd shots the waxy coating causes jamming but if you have the time beforehand wipe em all quickly with alcohol saves this happening or just stop using cheap subsonic Winchester bullets and use eley wasps they are much better its much quieter than my 22 air rifle with silencer on ,pain in the ass a silencer here in uk(Scotland) is classified as a firearm in itself ,an our licensing is unbelievably strict ,my cousins in Canada wanted one too (goebels in Canada where I bought my ruger)I think they are illegal there,so I'll tell u about someone I know who had idea to get one over there later 😉

Laugh now but answered well that was fkn plan !!! , don't remember much for few days , but saw hurt i was causing round me I got no sympathy didnt want it parents called me all selfish bastards etc, as they would have no life , I ended up hanging myself with a belt over door lifting legs behind me MAN DO NOT TRY THIS I spent 3 or 4 min with crushed throat every cell of me telling me put legs down till finally after minutes of HELL I lost consciousness and bang belt snapped and landed face first on ground awake , aaaargh so frustrated I went to my go to try get sectioned , he refused to see me not 1 patient waiting ,and he said no means no no appt not seeing him , I will see him alone someday ,sorry was imagining what id do …. Anyway short story b4 dr I tried again but knowing what I went thru 1st time couldn't do it now iv a good psych good gp good health ish it cann be helped depression kills so many iv lost 10 close friend's to suicide , I know a simple painless guaranteed out, and wouldn't tell anyone for a million quid life is for living look at what u have others in different places would kill for go volunteer I spent months in North Africa it will humble you ,u think u have nada go to a war torn country or dictatorship u have a life like a king compared to others

Sorry thats completely untrue I went to housing office ,told them I was homeless due to a divorce etc that night I was put in a bed and breakfast, then moved to a temp house in a town miles from home but it was that or nothing ,temp accommodation i got is a semi furnished 1 bedroom bungalow ,perfect just too far from “home"" but ill soon be moved to a house of my own rental from council or housing association, most of homeless in UK is by choice, don't want to move 50 miles away ,govt has to put a roof over your head for 28days min sure there is a huge housing shortage but that's because migrants come here with 5 kids and instantly have right to a 4 bedroom house 3 if they can't find bigger, pay no rent as housing and unemployment benefit pays it all ,sure if you just put your name on list for a house you could wait years but minimum you will get is a bed and breakfast in UK I know a lot of people who beg on streets of city and make 150 quid on fri sat night then go home to wife n kids in Nice house ,in theory homeless shouldn't exist but mental problems drug problems cause all sorts such a shame govt doesn't tell u what your entitled too u need to find out for yourself, walk into job centre 1st poster on wall in polish is how to claim benefits in UK, country's a pushover no wonder everyone wants to get here , I was a carer and 1 woman I helped with meds each day ,didnt need a carer but had to to get certain benefits she had a brand new car and £1500 a month by working system

Narcissistic Mothers
·
Feb 6
I just gave my mother a letter telling her about all the neglect she's made me and my sisters go through. What should I expect her response to be?
Hello and thanks for your question. I did something very similar to what you described here. I can't say how your mother will respond, but my mother shared the letter with my sister. And, even though I wasn't present when they discussed it, her reaction was pretty much that I was going crazy and my perception of my childhood growing up was convoluted and distorted. My sister didn't say anything at all, but she shared this letter with my nephew's. Basically my family looked at me like my truth was me being too emotional, over sensitive, over reacting to something that never happened. So basically I didn't get any closure or resolve. All I can say is if your mother is highly narcissistic, don't expect to get a “ah ha” moment and suddenly she takes ownership of her actions or shows any feeling of remorse whatsoever. For me, she used the rest of the family to turn it around to backfire in my face. I felt worse afterwards. I only felt a sense of release while writing it, but I regret giving it to her. I hope this helped.

Many don’t understand the illness but the ones who love you will never be upset with you. Those who love you have been with you and know the suffering and to add to that by making you feel bad about your actions is cruel. Be kind and forgiving to yourself. It was not your fault what happened. Those who don’t understand can piss off and live in their bubble of ignorance. They are not worth it. Your recovery from the psychosis is all that matters now. Stay strong.

Should I marry a guy who is taking care of his adult schizophrenic son indefinitely? His son is 24, sleeps all day, refuses to shower, work, or clean up after himself. His schizophrenic symptoms and behaviors are disturbing to me.
No. You seem to immature to understand the needs. Go find someone else to bother.

What crimes can schizophrenics/psychotic people get away with?
Your question is insulting. People with serious mental illness are not trying to get away with anything. You should research and educate before asking such ignorant questions. If a person with schizophrenia kills someone and gets away with it is because the system failed them not because they wanted to kill someone and get away with it. It’s questions like this that make me sick of people who gleefully walk through life unaware of the pain for SMI. Asshole.

Clean up your resume and starting start applying for jobs you are qualified for.

Don’t stress, I promise you’ll find a job if you genuinely try. Good luck.

So true, the more Of a big deal you make it, the more they’ll be drawn to it. The more you talk about it, the more curious they’ll become about it. Let others be themselves. Don’t try to change, mold or control that individual.

You can warm up through the day or week with for play. Stimulate the mind of your partner. It’s sexy to send a short text message, note or By verbally tell her in the beginning of the day something erotic. Then follow up a time or two through the day. This doesn’t need a response. You’re simply making a statement that will start painting a sexy setting in her mind.
(mental foreplay)
I wouldn’t get into too much detail of what she should expect; every woman likes to be surprised. Make her wonder, make her curious; this will make her eager to jump your bones.
When the time is right and you two can be alone, she’ll be ready to pounce you. Control yourself and Make her wait. This will be hard but SO worth it! Don’t rush to it immediately, Just take your time and enjoy the ride.

What does Stephen Hawking mean when he says ""Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing""?
First, you need to know that the quantum vacuum of space is not empty. Its very nature causes it to become a seething cauldron of virtual particle/anti-particle pairs which poof into existence because the vacuum is inherently quantum unstable, and then self annihilate in less than a Planck time, so there is no violation of the Law of Conservation of Mass-Energy. When matter congregates so closely that gravity overcomes the strong and weak force, and electrons, protons and neutrons collapse into complete congruence, there is Nothing left in the core of a black hole but a gravitational well that swallows spacetime itself. So when black holes are all that is left, and they evaporate due to Hawking Radiation, you are back to nothing. Real nothing. Since the sum of all matter and energy in the Universe is Zero, then nothing and the totality of something are in exact balance. But the quantum vacuum is inherently unstable and pure nothing is totally unstable. Nothing HAS to explode.

Why did Hawking believe that the universe can create by itself and God is not necessary?
I suspect that it was for the same reason that many if not most cosmologists aren’t believers: the more you know about the origins of the universe, the more you realize that there are better explanations than the ones originally proposed. After all, religion was mankind’s first — and worst — attempt at science. Early humans were desperate to understand such frightening things as earthquakes, volcanoes, seismic waves, floods, disease, lightning and thunder, and ravenous insects and beasts, to say nothing of aberrant human behavior. But as knowledge of such things improved — as it continually does — the need for a divine explanation inexorably diminished, until by today, it has practically vanished. Wiping out the last vestige of the need for gods to explain natural phenomena — that will require an even more esoteric understanding of nature, and cosmology and quantum physics seem to be the fields best equipped to ferret out the remaining answers. So it’s only logical that the scientists who understand these concepts best are the ones who feel the least need to rely on ancient superstitions for answers. ==

Wow. Incredible post and very well articulated. You articulated exactly what My ex was ASD (with ASD) and myself ADHD. (ADHD )were dealing with The worst relationship for myself to be in. He was not actively seeking help and I was. I tried my best to counsel and help him understand things but the shut downs and communication/both verbal and non verbal were awful. We were both anxious to find someone to settle down with , but to force something that wasn't meant to be and unhealthy from the start was disaster upon disaster. I seriously hope the guy gets some counseling eventually , he will need it if he ever finds someone to settle down with.

How about a daycare lead teacher to a Pre-K student (3–4 yrs old) saying something like this, “do that again and see what happens” ? I Including gestures like she's about to fight the kid (sounding intimidating), loud and hastily…
Personally I was in total disgust with how this particular teacher controlled her classroom. Acted like she ran the entire show (at a dump daycare).

It's extremely comforting and reassuring to read of other's experiences with intellectual disabilities and realizing I'm not alone in my thoughts, insecurities, and experiences. 33 and finally getting ADHD treatment.

My ex sounds like you. I suspected Asperger's or ASD. Interesting though, I would say some of it obvious from observation but very high functioning. Mostly impacted his self esteem and had difficult time connection with others (especially on emotional level) . Missed out on some social cues also.

Why do some teachers refuse to explain things to students and call it ""spoon-feeding""? Do they enjoy it when a student is confused and ends up with no knowledge on a subject? Do they not care?
For students, school can be incredibly overwhelming, unfair, and difficult. Schools are human institutions, so they’re flawed. Teaching is a tough job, and school can get pretty overwhelming for them too. So it might not always be obvious, but I believe that the vast majority of teachers are in education because they’re passionate about their subject and, most importantly, they really care about their students. Short answer Knowing when and how much support and help to give to students is actually a core teaching skill. Not enough support and a student will get confused and end up with no knowledge. Too much support and the student isn’t appropriately challenged and they don’t learn. The right amount of support appropriately challenges a student. The knowledge sticks better because the student earned it themselves, they gain confidence in themselves as learners, and they become more independent. Long answer Traditional teaching is based on the the psychology of behaviorism. There are carrots and sticks in the form of grades. The role of the professor is to transmit information to students. The role of students is to plop that information into their brains and regurgitate it during a test or quiz. It’s a pretty simplistic model. In the U.S., standards and curriculum are shifting towards more constructivist approaches to learning. Constructivism/social-constructivism are an educational philosophy that state that learners construct knowledge and understanding, piece-by-piece, as individuals and as communities of learners. Knowledge can’t be transmitted, matrix-style, it has to be built by the learner. Just as construction workers need scaffolds to build a tall structure, students often need temporary help and guidance in building skills and constructing knowledge. The role of the teacher is to assess students’ relevant abilities, understandings, or skills and then give them the appropriate amount of support. If your teacher says “I don’t want to spoon-feed you” what they’re really saying is that they think you already possess the means of finding the answer, and that doing so would be a valuable learning experience.

How much meth should you smoke?
Well for one, if u smoke it, don't hold it in long at all, inhale and the let it out! But the best advice I can give you, is Don't Do it, ì wished I knew what I know now, b4 I ever even tried it the first time, it doesn't come with no label, or tells you side effects and everything else it does and doesn't do!!! All you hear about it,, is how people labels you, and thinks that is what happens all the time,, like the sores,, rotten teeth, and allvthe other shit they say on the news and on tv,a person doesnt always end up like that! It is nothing like it used to be, it used to be fun, and it kinda made me feel like a ninja, but all the ingredients has changed from what it used to be like! And now it's not even fun, it eats up your bones, mainly my ankle, feet, and lower back, it consumes you…

What could this mean to you?? ... Every night when ever I turn some ofy inside light off inside my home, or turn them all off, I've noticed that once I do either or, the neighbors that live behind me , turns all there lights off to as soon as mine go out, and them I've notice that all of the other neighbors lights go out , even the street over has all there lights turned off, even all the street lights are turned off, and everything is awkwardly qiiet, and alot of these neighbors would keep there light running 24/9.….and I got to mention this also, it's pitch black dark outside when everyone's lights go out basically the same thing mine do, now I know i don't turn everyone's light off with my switch, but then I see like a laser light been (a white dot from the flahlight but it's just a all faint dim light that just clicks on and hovers all over the place fast like, and just remember there are trees and bushes standing in front of this hovering light , meaning that everytime this light passes past a tree , the light should blink from passing behind it, but it never does!! It's a steady light beam that floats around and nothing ever interferes wt the lights beam, so I guess I have a bunch of questions, about why would everyone turn there lights off, and even the street lights would go out too!!!? Am I being watched or what's y'all opinion, and for the hovering flash light beam that clicks on and hovers without any interference from the tree and bush line that's like a fence, just a steady light dot floating thru my neighbors back yard, I'm starting to think that they probably some kind of dope head or something just trying to mess with me, or either it's the muthafu@#in feds watching me? Don't know why that would be possible, but u never know these days... Really hope to hear from someone y'all to get sum good and crazy and bad thoughts to all of what I just said of what it could be, what it probably is, and of course what it ain't, let me know soon please y'all thank you and appreciate y'all time in advance....

Even ‘nice guys’ can be abusers. The outside persona generally does not represent what happens behind closed doors. The child abusers, the wife beaters - more often than not, they are those in positions of trust, or perceived trust.

This man most likely had severe anxiety or special needs. Surely he should have been met with compassion rather than ridicule? Really over the condescending and dismissive attitudes the majority of the medical community holds toward people with mental health issues.

Can I sue my wife for cheating when she was 100 pound before marriage and is now almost a 200 pound fat woman?
First of all, let me advice you to take your words back. * Respectfully*. Why do you even use the word ‘sue’ ? Yes! It's not a big deal? She can diet and exercise and get her back for you. May be she's not doing right because you're not motivating her encouraging her to take care of herself. And yes after marriage there are sudden dramatic changes of hormones shift takes place. You shouldn't be blaming her man! You should have talk to her in person and please don't make things worse. Because it's doable and I see a lot of people doing this. It's just how you dealing with her and motivating her to do things. Hope you find this positive! Don't take it seriously.

How can I study for 10+ hours a day without getting depressed and how can I make myself get used to it?
Well, a piece of advice. Don't study hard rather study smart. You won't get anything to study more hours. You have beard heard pretty sure of this that excess of everything is bad! Well I would recommend you to change yourself because you have used the word depression which is likely to affect your performance.

How can I study for 10+ hours a day without getting depressed and how can I make myself get used to it?
Well, a piece of advice. Don't study hard rather study smart. You won't get anything to study more hours. You have heard pretty sure of this that excess of everything is bad! Well I would recommend you to change yourself because you have used the word depression which is likely to affect your performance. You need to get over this depression first before you race to something else. I would suggest to change your routine and add some activities to your daily life.

Why do people divorce after being together for decades?
Well, we all have different personality traits. Everyone has a different chemistry. There are actually two different factors which will determine the prognosis of marriage. 1). Endurance 2). Temperament. We all have issues in our life but we need to sort it out together. The fact people get divorced after being living together so long is due to they don't really understand each other feelings and emotions. Marriage doesn't mean you should have children and spend life together it means to understand each other notions and feelings of others and support each other. If we don't understand each other feelings and notions then there is no point in living together. You get life once you should have enjoyed rather than spoiling it. Think before you chose someone to live for life.

Let’s say in 100 years from now, what do you expect would be going on in the area? I feel like more economic unions and atheism is inevitable. What would that look like…?

What should Russia's Putin do next re the Ukraine war? What should its priorities be?
Let me tell you about priorities of Timur Ivanov, Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation. They should shed some light on preparedness of the Russian Armed Forces for the ongoing war in Ukraine and where lies patriotism of the Russian generals. Ivanov's son from his first marriage lives in Mexico. Throughout hostilities in Ukraine, Ivanov’s second wife, Svetlana Maniovich, who’s dodged sanctions has been living in France. Ivanov’s second wife’s son lives in the UK. Ivanov’s second wife’s daughter lives in France. Ivanov’s second wife and their children have Israeli citizenship. From the mouth of a child. After Mariupol was completely destroyed and captured by Russian troops, the Ministry of Defense began the construction of Potemkin Village - residential buildings, a pool and a skating rink - to show Russian citizens that they didn't bomb Mariupol and 440,000 residents continue to enjoy above average lifestyle. Timur Ivanov oversees all construction projects in the ministry: from departmental kindergartens to the Vostochny cosmodrome. He has access to multi billion dollar funds courtesy of his friend, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu. Here’s what Navalny investigation team have found out about Timur Ivanov. A sprawling classical style estate in Tver Oblast, a country house in the luxury village Rublyovka, and a town house in Moscow. Everything is paid for by the Military Construction Complex that Timur Ivanov oversees. The main contractor of the ministry, OlimpCityStroy, syphoned 17 billion rubles from the construction in the ruined city of Mariupol to pay for the renovation of Ivanov family’s classic mansion in the centre of Moscow, a country house in Rublyovka Luxury Village, and a new massive estate in the Tver region. The contractor of the Ministry of Defense paid for a variety of works in these properties, up to the supply of marble. Among close friends of the family are Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and his wife Tatiana Navka. They regularly appear at family parties together. Westernsky, let me speak to you heart to heart. Don’t be afraid of Putin’s nuclear war threats. Putin’s generals will never launch a nuke at Europe or America or Israel. They have children, wives, real estates, yachts and happy memories over there. They’d rather strangle the little KGB school grad that got intoxicated on absolute power than carry out his doomsday order. Yes, generals bombed Mariupol because they embezzle money from rebuilding it. The war is just another opportunity for them for looting, nothing more. Russians with their brute docility march into the meat grinder for the thieves who rule over them to loot with impunity believing they are true patriots of Russia who are liberating Ukrainians from Nazis. You can’t teach this people democracy, human rights, or dignity. If not stopped, they are going to obliterate Ukraine and sincerely believe they’ve set them free.

Living with Adult ADHD
·
2y
Reaching out to other females with ADHD, I am wondering, what are your symptoms as a female with ADHD? I am finally being treated at the age if 44.
I've read females with ADHD experience exacerbated PMS the week before menstruation. I have cold sweats, nightmares, irritability, impulsivity, swelling and depression. When not on my period: I have extremely poor working memory and forget “to do"" things pretty quickly. Sometimes on bad days it effects my ability to do maths in my head as I can't hold the numbers in my head. On bad days reading can be difficult as minor noises distract me and I end up reading the same sentences again and again. I could read the whole thing but not actually take anything in. If I get hyperfocussed on something I lose track of time and end up not eating then binge eating quick, easy, unhealthy food when I realise how late it is. I get easily distracted, while writing this I have been distracted a number of times and it has taken me way longer than it should have. Sensory sensitivity. Hearing, light, heat and I don't like being touched, I was never a kid who let the other girls braid my hair and I don't do hugs. Weirdly I'm known at my workplace as the person to deal with aggressive animals because I don't feel much pain from wounds and bruises but headaches, sore throats and stomach cramps can knock me out. Bad with impulsive purchases Procrastination is my worst problem Out of sight out of mind, works on dishes, washing and unfortunately people Time blindness. Even if I know a birthday is coming soon it's always later and never something I need to worry about now which means that it creeps up on me and suddenly it's that person's birthday and I don't have time to get their gift or card. Peeing, I put off going to the loo subconsciously till I'm desperate. It's almost similar to how I don't eat if I'm hyperfocussed. I've had so many near misses. Crafts, I have so many crafts and tools to make things. So many are unfinished. When someone asks for a craft I start it but never finish it due to perfectionism and possibly because I'm no longer hyperfocussed on the craft. Exhausted. I get ADHD paralysis a lot. I overthink everything and end up thinking through the whole process of a task as multiple, annoying, tedious steps and stress about it and end up tiring myself out before even doing the damn task. Poor socialising. I find it really hard to do small talk and have always been labelled as quiet or shy but it's because I don't want to embarrass myself, offend anyone or because I don't think I have anything to talk about that would interest another person. I have comorbid depression and anxiety I feel is the result of living with undiagnosed ADHD till I was 32. I have always been exhausted, overthinking, empathetic (especially with animals), and had trust issues with how badly I've been treated by people and with no clear answer till now I have hated being alive and around people. Skin picking to self sooth. I really try not to but it's subconscious sometimes. Vocal stimming. Poor emotional regulation. I can't let something that has upset me or pissed me off go for days or even weeks sometimes.

damn…pretty much took the words right out of my mouth! Finally an answer to this question (and one similar to it) that is, for the most part, one that survivors and/or still current victims of these monsters of ALL walks of life (aka defined status’s) can benefit from completely. Weather the Narc in our lives are someone we’re dating, or our mother, father, brother, friend, ex, or the entire damn clan…your answer fits everyones mold. Nicely said, thank you.
We should ALL remember that the Narc this person has to deal with may (and does) differ statistically than the next. SO’s are NOT the only people that we should be answering our questions around.

I misconstrued a comment that i wrote to you, a complete stranger. lol.
So, because of that, i do apologize if i came off as rude or snide or disbelieving to your answer. Totally the opposite intention.

“The pain of fibromyalgia is so severe that I prayed for death before I was diagnosed. I would have taken anything to relieve the pain, and if the pain couldn't be controlled then death was preferable.” ←—- SAME — I feel your pain, fibromyalgia absolutely blows!
But, 1600mG of Norco?!?!? My god, how many did you take a day?! 160!? Or am I misinformed on the highest possible mG of that particular narcotic?
(Also, fun fact - all “narcotic” pain meds that i’ve taken/been prescribed actually have the opposite effect on me. Not too sure why it is, but there is NEVER a chance of me falling asleep while taking pain meds. In fact, it almost acts as a focus enhancer for me - much like Adderall does for folks with ADD/HD, which i’m also diagnosed with

Sorry, this is probably a hella obvious math equation that my 9 yr old brother would be able to solve, ive always been one little dumbed down molecule off though, so can you please tell me (in another explination) what N=1 is? I’m intrigued, totally!
OAN, i have to say, i’m almost 33 yrs old..although the true length of time my mother has used, only surpasses that number by a couple years, give or take. she did not raise me (thank god) so i never saw her on a regular basis, but there hasn't been one moment in MY entire 33 years of her life that shes been anything but fat, or not on meth.
TBH, i seriously wonder HOW some people on it regularly and for that long never lose a noticeable amount of weight. (i say “people” but really i just wonder about her and why she never seemed to lose, if anything, she gains. And yes, i know for a fact she still uses.
But, damn, her own child *me* can start taking prescribed (to me) vyvanse or Adderall (as perscribed to me) and 3 months later i drop a good 40lbs! Her second child, 3 yrs younger than me, does the same as me (okay but his aren't prescribed to him) AND works out everyday, AND eats the most grossest sounding health diet everyday, and 2 weeks later i’m asking him if he’s alright because he looks like a damn cancer patient! totally wish i was just exaggerating, it was heartbreaking to say the least.
But, my mother, i swear one would be skeptical if we had to go off looks alone (or simply by just *weight* alone) about weather or not she uses or how long she has. Shes been in and out of jail my whole life bc of it though so, well…
I have known a few other ppl on the heavier side whove been doing it for multiple years.
So, what exactly is N=1?
And, FML for my writing this comment, because it only brought a lot of other questions to surface for me lol, sorry. I’ll take my ambien now.

Agreed. Been living with Endo for 15 years, was a $100/day addict for 4 years straight between 2008 and 2012(ish). (To be clear, back then the price of one pill was $5 in Texas, now it’s $8-$10 a pop) ..drug of choice, Hydrocodone/acetaminophen. I usually started my every day like clockwork, taking my (up to) 20 pills at once at the same time each day. But if Mother Nature decided she wanted to come to me in my sleep or in the rare day I tragically didn’t have any at all to take, I was doomed.
I have found Naproxen (Aleve) to be very effective, if taken at first notice of cramp threats. Midol Extended Relief is also good. FUN FACT: Caffeine is found in Acetaminophen, which is found in Hydrocodone..and is also known to intensify menstural cramp pain.
Hydrocodone should be ur last resort. Don’t become addicted especially Bc of some regular ol cramps

What do you do when literally NO ONE will legit be real with you and LISTEN and do the RIGHT thing for someone that they all say they CARE about...but turn around and HURT them and just leave them in the DUST & DARK? MENTALLY & PHYSICALLY. ""Hear"" whats ""said"" around....yet, they’d rather watch me die slowly and ABUSE me in EVERY WAY possible. Yay me. Some people are considered 'special' as others are considered 'crazy'. But... what if yourself is the one who makes other people 'special' who in turn call you 'crazy'? Selfish. Greedy. Manipulative. EVIL. Vindictive.... But thanks everyone, appreciate the SUPPORT that was NEVER there...and knowing not one person actually really gives a shit about me or what happens to me. ALL FOR A FUCKING PAYCHECK AS WELL AS ""REPUTATION."" Fuck all of you. Be me...then see wtf life really is.
I guarantee that, any of you will find an understanding and caring person, as me. Because I'm just only ONE person to the world, right?
Just do what you gotta do for YOURSELF once again…just to get what you want, yet again…because you think you are so much better than not only me but “so&so""… and think you deserve EVERYTHING….not. Buddy.
I am who I am…and the people who know who helped raised me to be the REAL(the only good parts of me) me…deserve greatness. So thank you. I know many of you are reading this or GOD ONLY KNOWS, I asked for help, I called out while I was in the dark alone, screaming for help, but no one ever comes….

In my experience dealing with the price of any pill being sold on the street is that it's always been a dollar a milligram. So if u have a 5 mg pill then it would be safe to say that the pill is going for a street value of 5.00.

I just want to say that my response was intended to be light hearted with a sprinkling of sarcasm on top and not meant to offend or judge anyone at all. I do not have room to judge, anyone, ever. I too have spent my fair share of hours on the internet researching related topics and poured over many an article written by well meaning armchair doctors with a PHD in bullsh*t. I wasted many hours and caused myself unnecessary stress and anxiety trying to beat a test I had no way of studying for and no easy fool proof way to pass. In desperation I tried some of the advice I read up on always hopeful, always driven by the illusion and promise of the quick fix that just had to be out there somewhere because so and so knew of someone that tried such and such and it worked for them every time. Every sure fire, guaranteed, absolute one hundred percent quick fix I tried also immediately failed. In the end it was ultimately I, on my own, without internet assistance who through trial and error, many long and lonely hours of soul searching and even longer hours of hard looks in the mirror discovered the only true way to ever pass a drug test. And that was to never again use drugs. Was it easy? Oh hell no! Did I like it? Not at first. Did I screw up? More than once that's for sure. But I take it one day at a time. I'm not going to sit behind my keyboard and get all high and mighty, that's not why people come to these sites. I understand more than you know believe me, I do. I just wanted to shed some light on why I answered the question the way I did and although it was a dick like response and will no doubt offend those who are too sensitive and take this shit way too seriously, it was not intended for that purpose at all. For those of you out there who are too easily butt hurt I say LIGHTEN THE F*CK UP ALREADY. And to the rest of you, the ones out there who make life interesting and enjoyable and humorous, stay real, stay golden pony boy!!!

How can I pass a urine drug test for meth?
I did not read any other answers before I posted mine but I want to be sure that you have been informed of this totally, one hundred percent, fool proof ,money back if your not delighted guaranteed way to pass a urine drug screen for not only meth but any drug. Not very many people know about this simple trick that's nearly impossible to screw up and requires very minimal preparation and doesn't call for copious amounts of water or any special dietary supplements or crazy concoctions that we all know , let's face it, do NOT work anyway. Are you ready to discover the simple ,one step only and best way ever to beat ANY drug test? ****drum roll for dramatic effect inserted here*******
Step one: STOP USING METH…

Ya! Dump him! He's really selfish. I'm sorry you had a bad first experience! But you will find a better man! Someone who will take their time with you to make it more comfortable until it is! My ex-wife had a immune disease called lichens sclerosis to where she lost the elasticity in her vagina making sex very painful for her and it would rip her every time! Which hurt me! And FYI that's not why we got divorced! Lol I never once made her feel bad about it! 🙂

What a amazing boxer and an amazing country! I'm American. And I don't agree with many things my country has done and continues to do! But I believe in democracy and we the USA, the European Union, and the rest of the world cannot sit on the sidelines and and watch the terrors and murder continue! I know and understand how this great country is viewed, but as a whole most of us are not as ignorant, selfish, cocky bullys like a lot of the leaders we've had! We want peace and unwavering independence that everyone on this earth equally deserves. Nobody wants WW3 or a nuclear war! But we should all stand united for the greater good!

I'm a medical student struggling to study for boards. I have ADHD and take Vyvanse and Adderall but they don't seem to be working anymore. I also feel like I've lost motivation and even when I take my meds I have trouble concentrating. What can I do?
There may be something else going on besides your ADHD that’s causing the loss of motivation and trouble concentrating. Depression can also manifest in this manner. Seems like it’s time to see your friendly neighborhood physician and discuss this in more depth.
With love from a former medical student (who suffered from depression during med school).

So glad you left and good for you! I was in a similar situation late during my pregnancy and got out ASAP. My (now-ex) husband didn’t even call me when I was delivering his child. He wasn’t there and has never asked to meet his daughter, who is now a beautiful and feisty 8 month old! Your daughter will grow up to be amazing with such a strong and inspirational momma!

My therapist wants me to start on antidepressants. My family is against it, saying they don't work, only making everything worse. What should I do? Do they work properly?
Change this question to “my doctor wants me to start insulin. My family is against it, saying it doesn’t work.” And yet, very few people question that insulin treats diabetes. So why is it different with mental illnesses such as depression? Because it’s “in your head”? Guess what? So are a ton of other conditions, including epilepsy, migraines, stroke, MS, Parkinson’s disease etc., but we would never question treating those illnesses with appropriate medication.

Thank you. I needed to read this. I have been trying to wrap my head around why my husband (whom I now realize has NPD), would steal all the money from our joint bank account and file for divorce a week after I gave birth to his daughter. He never even asked to meet her. I could not for the life of me understand how anyone could be so cold, until I realized, just as you said, that he truly doesn’t understand love. He only understands power and control. Now that he can no longer control me, he doesn’t want to have anything to do with me or his child.

Be very careful with this way of thinking. I suffered with major depression on and off since my teens. I thought a spouse would help (company, someone who would listen etc.), but boy was I wrong. Marrying the wrong person caused me to sink deeper and deeper into depression. Not only did he not listen when I told him I was suffering; he called me “nuts” and “hormonal”, belittling me at every turn. I told him I wanted to go to therapy or start medications, but he said it was ridiculous. I got pregnant without meaning to, and felt stuck in the relationship, until I finally realized what was happening. Got out of the relationship very recently, but still have feelings of guilt and I feel overwhelmed about raising a child. Bottom line is: just having a spouse doesn’t necessarily solve anything, and can make things a lot worse.

What do you call the smell which wine gives off?
As a wine ages, chemical reactions among acids, sugars, alcohols and phenolic compounds create new smells that are known as a wine's bouquet. These can include honey in an aged Sauternes or truffles in a Pinot noir.

After an ultrasound the technician told me to wait a few minutes before going to the bathroom and getting dressed just in case she needed to redo the exam. She also promised me a photo of my baby but then she disappeared. 30 mins later I wandered out only to be told that she had gone home. I never did get the ultrasound photo of my baby girl but at least I finally got to pee!

What are some of the negative effects of depression that most people not aware of?
That emotional pain IS pain and hurts as bad as any physical pain. That emotional pain can be severe enough to prevent someone experiencing it to be unable to function normally and can certainly prevent them from even beginning to try to heal themselves. Would we tell someone with a broken leg to immediately begin walking on it, even though the meds to deal with the pain will take at least a month to kick in, if they ever do in fact kick in? Well, that’s essentially what we are doing when we tell someone who is experiencing a depressive episode to “go take a walk”, “watch a funny show”, or “think happy thoughts” . When the pain is intense, it can be impossible to even think of doing anything. A depressed person does not need their family and/or friends to fix them. They’ve probably read all…

What is the coolest line a pilot has said to the passengers?
Coming in to Wellington, NZ, which is known for being very windy and it was really putting on a show. The plane was rocking all over the place and the pilot had made two attempts to land and was making his third (and final attempt- he had advised us that if he didn’t make it this time we would have to go on to Palmerston North). Some passengers were getting hysterical and the lady in the seat behind us was praying. We eventually landed (the plane approached the runway sideways) and the pilot came over the loudspeaker and said, “Well, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did!”. The whole plane applauded.

My laptop does not boot it just shows the company logo how do I fix this?
Computers that get stuck at the manufacturer logo usually mean the hard drive has failed or at least is failing. I would suggest that you turn it off and do not continually try to boot it. Bring it to someone who can attempt to recover your data (personal files) and then have them diagnose the computer.

Has anyone ever gained superpowers in real life after an accident?
Jason Padgett He was a party guy who hated school and got really bad grades. One day, two men savagely attacked him and robbed Jason outside a bar, leaving him with a severe concussion. This damage turned him into a math genius and made him learn fractal geometry, which he had never learned before. He then became a renowned mathematician. Derek Amato At 39, he hit his head after diving into a pool. He was diagnosed with a concussion and 35% hearing loss. After that Derek started seeing black and white keys on his head and out of nowhere started playing the piano like an expert and eventually became a composer. Ben McMahon He was in a car accident in 2015 and was in a coma for a week. When he woke up, he spoke perfect Chinese, even though he had only learned the basics in childhood. Tony Cicero He was struck by lightning while making a call in a phone booth. Within days, he became addicted to music, which wasn't the case before. After experimenting with the piano, he became a musical artist who composes his own music. I may not call them superpowers, but they are definitely powers for the uninitiated.

What is the bravest thing a child has done?
A three-year-old girl fell into an abandoned well 20 meters deep. The diameter of the well was only 30 centimeters. Since the well was too small, the firefighters could not go down to save her in any way. If they had used an excavator at that time, it would have taken too long, too much. That day, a volunteer had brought his son with him and said that the boy could try to save the girl. The boy was 14 years old and his name is Min Ran. To not worry everyone, he lied saying that he was 17 years old. The firefighters informed him of the possible dangers. Min Ran and his parents said they were willing to take all possible risks. He tried five times but without success. The first and second time he had to come out to readjust the descent angle. The third time he told the girl not to be afraid, I'm here to save you. The fifth time he heard the girl tell him not to go. He comforted the girl by telling her not to be afraid, I will come back soon to save you. The sixth time, he finally made it. Later, a journalist asked him if he had been scared. He said that at that moment he wasn't thinking about anything, he was just thinking of saving the girl.

on the same logic, it should also be possible to use the “after:yyyy” option to further narrow it down.

This week has already been a lot on me and today at work I’m waiting on my tables the same as I always do.
I proceeded to check this table out and the lady asks Lady: How much would you like for a tip? Me: Whatever you give me is fine. Lady: what do you need? Me: Nothing Man with the lady: How old are you? Me:24 Him: you have kids? Me: yes a son, he’s 4. Her: if he needed anything how much would it be? Me: He needs a lot I’m not sure( I smile and walk away) Her: you pay all your bills? Me: yes ma’am Her: if you had a pay a bill today what would it be? Me: Rent her: How much is your rent? Me: $375 Her: Okay I’m leaving you a $375 tip, I’m paying your rent for august. Y’all I couldn’t do anything but cry!!! This was a blessing in disguise! Credit: Kiara Brown

As a 40-year-old plus wanabee web developer, am I better off freelancing with PHP, WordPress, and Laravel, or continuing my learning of React and Node to try and get a salaried job?
This is a huge apples/oranges can of worms. First off, let’s dismiss Wordpress for the moment: 1. Serverside: Node (Javascript) vs. PHP: PHP language 2. Serverside MVC framework: PHP: Laravel vs. ?? 3. Javascript client framework: React vs. ?? So notice a few things here: Node is not React nor vice versa. Node is a serverside runtime that competes with PHP as a serverside runtime. Laravel is an MVC framework (which also happens to be a dependency injection framework) that facilitates integration with component libraries you include or write yourself. Typically you are going to write at very least, models and controllers, and configure routes. What is the corresponding technology with Node? Well there are projects like Express and Meteor that might fit the bill. What about an ORM to support integration with a relational database like MySQL or Postgresql? That is part of Laravel (Eloquent) but in node you might want or need to use Sequelize or TypeORM. React is a javascript client framework based on the idea of creating reusable components. It has no intrinsic binding to any serverside technology, so as a matter of fact you can use React with Node or PHP. It requires a significant paradigm shift from what you might have been doing in the past. This question really comes down to what type of a developer you want to be, or actually can be. Are you a serverside developer (lower demand, high mastery of DevOps and server architecture including scalability, api development with xml/soap or rest pattern) session management, relational and non-relational data persistence, SQL, streaming tech, etc.) vs “frontend” developer (high demand, mastery of javascript, html, css, json, rest api use). A select group of people are truly “full stack” but that is often both a “only so many hours in a day” as well as “jack of all trades” proposition. The simple answer when I read between the lines of your question, is that it sounds like your client side javascript skills could be better, but it’s not that simple really, because you also really need to know how to craft attractive well structured html and css, and integrate that with javascript, as they are foundational. There is also a whole world of tech and practices that experienced UI developers often employ. For example, javascript might need to be compiled, and/or minimized/obfuscated/packaged. CSS written in SASS or Stylus might need to be compiled. Your javascript might actually be Typescript. And there are a mind boggling number of choices for things that can take care of all these tasks, which may include transpiling your ES6+ javascript, and doing all the other associated tasks you might need to make your clientside code ready for testing or deployment. This is where Webpack, Gulp, Bower and Yarn (to name just a few) People do demand performant interactive UI’s, and that requires javascript with the latest greatest ajax support libraries and techniques. Demand for javascript framework UI developers is high, but again that doesn’t mean you have to also use node serverside. There is also a question of where to move certain functionality like routing. With an interactive javascript UI, it’s not like React by itself takes care of everything for you. React has also been evolving rapidly, such that React code you would write to day is incompatible with the code you would have written a year ago. For example, React hooks were added in React 16.8. And around that time you found articles like Why React’s new Hooks API is a game changer. If you happened to have learned React via one of the many online courses in the last 2 years, you would have learned to write code that is already obsolete. Exciting time! And of course, React is often paired with other client javascript libraries like Vue, not to mention the competitors to it like Angular, Vue and Ember. It’s a highly dynamic marketplace where things are changing weekly. I would suggest that really focus on upgrading your client side javascript/html/css skills. Absolutely! Table node for now, and see how things progress. If at some point, you are loving javascript as your daily focus, then a transition to Node will be fluid, and the paradigm shifts required will make sense. Becoming a current, and experienced javascript developer is a smart investment in time, no matter what technology stack you use in the future. It’s just as relevant to Java, .NET or Go web projects as it is to PHP or Node.

What are subtle signs of autism and Asperger syndrome?
Alexithymia. I have feelings, but they are not like normal feelings. My feelings are physical and spacial, and they are weirdly specific: expansive, elevated, compressed, condensed, open, swooshing, spinning, drowning. I often feel like loosely rigged scaffolding. The hardest part is that I don't feel sad when people die. It feels to me like they are free. Although most people like feeling free, I don't think it means the same thing for them. As Werner Herzog put it, happiness is a strange concept. After two years of rejections and rewrites, I had two papers accepted for publication on entropy and information. That is my obsession. I thought I might feel happy, but I just felt big. Too big. And diffuse. I listened to Anna Nalick’s song “Breathe (2AM)” on repeat for two weeks (at 40 times per day, 5 days a week, that’s about 400 repetitions). When NT people talk about ""love"" I often feel like Inigo Montoya: ""you keep on using that word... I do not think it means what you think it means."" In romantic situations I would say I feel like soft taffy, but the word “love” gets used in so many different contexts that I can't understand how it could possibly have a clear meaning. Obviously, I am not getting the sensation right. Sometimes I feel round, sometimes I feel square, and sometimes I feel sharp. Sometimes I feel sad, but rarely about things that NT people feel sad about. I do miss people sometimes, but not in the sense that I want to see them again so much as a fleeting sense that I really liked seeing them in the past. My feelings are often bizarrely inappropriate. Once I worked at a resort and one of my colleagues died during the night. When I was told about it in the morning I had to stop myself from laughing. It was such an unexpected statement that it felt funny, but even when it sunk in that it had actually happened - that it wasn't a joke, the guy was really dead - I didn't start feeling sad for days. It took time for everyone else's sadness to sink in for me. One thing that drives my wife nuts is that I am not easily drawn into a shared emotion, and unlike someone with ASPD, I cannot lie about it or pretend. I can just about see that she wants me to feel excited about this, annoyed at that, and angry about this other thing, but I can’t understand why or how I would feel that way. Also, it isn’t that she wants me to feel those emotions in particular, but that she wants me to share her feelings in general. I think she tolerates it (mostly) because it means I don’t manipulate her the way most people do. From this perspective, Trump and Brexit look like NT social phenomena. The leaders do not share their supporters’ values, beliefs, or financial status, but they appear to share their supporters’ feelings. That these feelings are dominated by hate and lust is a function of hate and lust being the most easily expressed emotions, not their ubiquity. Anxiety is one of the few feelings I commonly have that most people would find relatable. But I don't feel anxious about normal things. I have terrible anxiety around board games and card games and watching dramatic television shows. Alexithymia is very subtle until a relationship develops to the point where people expect me to share their emotions. At this point I feel like a fake person, like there is an essential core missing. David Foster Wallace seemed to have that feeling: There was a basic logical paradox that I called the ‘fraudulence paradox’ that I had discovered more or less on my own while taking a mathematical logic course in school. . . . The fraudulence paradox was that the more time and effort you put into trying to appear impressive or attractive to other people, the less impressive or attractive you felt inside — you were a fraud. And the more of a fraud you felt like, the harder you tried to convey an impressive or likable image of yourself so that other people wouldn’t find out what a hollow, fraudulent person you really were. The realisation that he was probably autistic and mis-diagnosed as depressed really pushed me to get myself assessed professionally, because that feeling of being fake no matter how hard to you try to be real just eats at you. Nowadays I often feel smooth, and that’s a much better feeling.

My dad tried to rape me 5 years ago and I can't get over it. What should I do?
Hi guys, I'm new to Quora and this will be my first post on here and its a pretty heavy one. I've been dealing with this same problem for 5 years now and I'm so confused and don't know what to do. And I'm just not mentally strong enough to go see a therapist, so here it is. 5 years ago, I was 19 at the time, my father tried to rape / have sex with me. Whatever the hell you wanna call it. I hate saying it but it is what it is. I managed to stop him by fighting him off and yelling at him but it's just the fact the he would ever do that, that still bothers me 5 years later. Since then my relationship with my parents has been pretty bad. My mom didn't believe me when i told her about it and is just ignorant about the whole thing. She acts like nothing ever happened. Same goes for my so called…

Can living with a narcissist make you sick?
Absolutely. It took me years to heal.
The stress and anxiety caused an autoimmune disorder. I had unexplained inflammation and huge issues with my digestion.
A new study has raised the possibility that stress may cause autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, because it found a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases among people who were previously diagnosed with stress-related disorders.
I’ve learned to take really good care of myself and eat very clean. I meditate for 30 minutes a day and exercise daily.
Take care of yourself and live your best life.
It’s the best revenge.

What did your narcissist do that made you have the ""light bulb"" moment?
I was fed up but still couldn’t pin point what was wrong. As I was taught, I always blamed myself for our problems.
Finally, with crocodile tears running down his face he said ‘I want someone who will worship me are you willing to do that?’
I calmly said ‘no I am looking for my equal…a partner in life’.
That was my light bulb moment.

What if I mix some peppermint oil with some weed oil in a cart? Is it safe?
Why would you do that? Don’t risk your health or anyone else’s.
If you are in a legal state buy safe and tested ‘carts’ from a legal dispensary.

How do I handle my NPD ex befriending a guy friend in my group post break up? I know he has ulterior motives & is probably doing this to change the narrative, make me the bad guy & he the victim. I can’t tell my friend to not speak to him. Ignore it?
Without defending yourself too much simply address it.
Something like this:
I have no desire to have a long conversation about this but I feel I need to say something.
My Ex has been on a smear campaign since we split. I would appreciate it, if you would judge me based on our interaction and not his accusations.
If you have any questions please ask but I’d prefer to NOT know what he is saying.
I’m trying to move on.

My step dad said I was a persona non grata, which means a person of no significance. Also he wanted to mind fuck me, along with emotional abuse, lies, alcoholism, attempted suicide for attention, controlling, immature etc he has and still has my mum hooked, been married for over 25 years, he has the house with surveillance cameras. Mum never done anything about it and called me poison when I approached her about it I've been no contact now for 4 years

How can we possibly be in the now when everything we see or hear came from the past?
Because we move with time, and so the present becomes ever-changing, as time does not stop flowing.

My daughter is kind of with an A hole too and living with him, and maybe this is another reason for me to start being self reliant and make a path. I am so afraid I won't make it on my own and will fail also, but I am a hard worker and will keep going to keep what I do have.
It really gets annoying living with him. I am always sperating myself from him into a different room just to save from having arguments that always seem to go towards it being all my fault again. The last few wks and months all I do is give to him and for us and for our apt, and he is an asswipe. He has said horrible things to me about me personally and calling me names, dropping me down to nothing. And now I know why it's all the build himself up. All I have ever done was for us and he always goes back to doing for himself. He doesn't drive so that's basically why I stay in a toxic work environment with him so he can have a ride to work everyday and I don't have to feel guilty by his word about not doing it. Sad for a 46 yr old man to rely on me for so much and then try to throw in my face how much he has done for me. And now if I leave here I still own nothing other than a car and some debt. I never seem to get very far. I am sorry for the rant, I probably really could use some counseling 😔 just very tired

I am currently involved in a situation like this and I have known what this was for a while, why I always choose to stay rather than have the courage to leave is beyond me. I think I am fearful of what is out of my comfort zone even though it is uncomfortable here most of the time. I am always the one made to feel crazy, stupid or I did something wrong or didn't say the right thing. We even work together, the higher ups see the way he is to me and in turn almost have started to act exactly the same to me.(I work there only 1 yr and it's just a warehouse job,there's more) I have no where else to ramble on about this. I have watched so many YouTube videos and read articles. I am just now starting to look into different work roles elsewhere, I think it's a start because he wants me to be reliant on him. Every month right after I've made my contributions towards our rent and bills, he is the one to ghost me. I really am needing a change. We have lived together 9 yrs and I am 42 now and feel like I'm just going to throw away what little bit I have left or lose it all 😞 I have no family since I lost my Mom and Grandparents around when I was 30. I think he saw me as easy prey. My sister moved herself 1200 miles away after all of the losses, she is single and has a nice job where she is but now her lease is expiring and I told her I couldn't help because I live here. So many times my 20 yr old daughter has wanted to come and see me and I told her she couldn't since it is his place and he is around. Idk what else I can do anymore I've been contacting so many shelters and I'm just at a loss

“They fuck you up, your mum and dad.¶

They may not mean to, but they do.
They fill you with the faults they had
And add some extra, just for you.¶

But they were fucked up in their turn
By fools in old-style hats and coats,
Who half the time were soppy-stern
And half at one another's throats.¶

Does going down a spiral of thoughts of self-harm/suicide whenever I get triggered by how I feel like I don't belong count as depression issues?

Growing up, my nana always told me that when we have dreams of our loved ones who have passed, it is them paying us a visit. She’s been gone forty years. Every dream I’ve had of her, and other family who have died have been very peaceful- so beautiful and up-lifting. I find comfort in that.💜🕊️

Oh my, your thoughts are so very insightful. I love it, and you are so on point in every aspect of the issue. My son came out when he was just sixteen in the year 2000. Since I was a teen when I had him, we have a very close and strong relationship with my parents. He, too, grappled with telling his grandparents. I told him I would leave the decision to him on when to tell them and that I will be there with him.
When we did tell them, their reaction was very similar to yours. “You are you, and we love you because of you! We stand by you every step of the way.” One thing that struck me, and made my love and admiration for my parents even stronger, was what my dad said afterwards. He said, “We have got to wrap our arms around him, always, and love him more…because the world out there loves people like him less.” He is now happily married with a successful career, something my parents thought they’d never live long enough to see because of the cruelty society puts on our LGBTQ members of humanity. Come to think of it, I should have had more confidence that my parents would be accepting-after all, they accepted me, and loved me, their seventeen year-old girl having a baby.

Hi Marie, I am in no way as prepared, fit or skilled as you sound but I do have PTSD and I do feel oddly okay. My thoughts were that I spend my days usually dealing with the panic and dread that I am now seeing everyone else experience is making me feel like the tables have been turned. And strangely I am feeling okay. I don’t really have the words to describe it but its like all these years my brain has been coaching me to get through something like this (nb. my brain has the shoddiest training techniques - I do not recommend them)

The matching colours thing confuses me. Everyone asked if the outfits would match on our wedding day but we never match on other days so why when we get married? I wore deep green and my partner wore a grey suit with orange-y coloured tie. We looked like a pumpkin, it was ace!

I couldn’t agree with your post more :D especially the bride being the centre of attention; All through the wedding planning I was upset at how much my partner was cut out of plans and even just general conversations about OUR wedding because I was the bride.. To make matters worse I am incredibly introverted and have social anxiety disorder so all the attention was hell for me. Even worse were the people who told me I would love the attention in the end - I didn’t xDxD My partner would have, he would have talked excitedly about plans, decorations, flowers etc. but no-one ever asked or continued a conversation with him. It was like he was a mere accessory to the whole thing and it really hurt us.

Having married earlier this year I had this exact same realisation about the ‘wedding dress’. I have always found it odd that brides all look the same when there is so much scope to choose from! I went with my favourite colour; a deep and vibrant green, the addition of a ’50s style underskirt made it feel a bit more special!

What if you didn’t have friends around when you fell apart?
What about people who don’t have friends who they can rely on in hardships?
What if the friends you talk about hurt you a lot and betrayed you in the past?
I wonder what you’d resort to… Alcohol only prepares you for resorting to it more often in future. The more you have it to escape pain and stress, the more you’ll seek it in future stresses.
Makes you incapable to handle the normal stresses. Sensitizes your pain to resort to other unhealthy ways to cope with.
Imagine the next time you crash and you don’t have friends around. What will you do?

Yoooo
ESTJ’s, like any other type, have their amazing traits as well as the not so good ones, and that's okay!!
I'm an ENFP, so I'm kind of a complete mess, which is why I have a huge crush over ESTJ’s practicality and even bossy side, even tho I don't like being bossed around, I would highly appreciate someone intimidating me more than a deadline to get my work done.
Also your honesty, straightforwardness, determination and assertiveness is something I hiiiiigghhlllyyyyy look up to!!
So love yourself Haley!! And when it comes to the bad traits, we're all trying to become aware of them by either self-introspecting (which I know is difficult for you to do, or maybe you view it as a waste of time but it's highly important to understand your race car and how it works in order to go vroooooom to the finish line, if my car had some broken parts than I'm unaware of I probably wouldn't win the race..) or by asking our loved ones about the negative traits they've noticed about us, putting in mind that it's normal and the task is to understand and fix the traits, and that it doesn't offend us in any way, it just makes us human.
So I hope you love yourself mate, or don't beat it up, go easy on yourself when you can and appreciate your good traits and accomplishments, while pushing others (as nice as possible) to accomplish things as well, at their own pace, just like you will.🤍

I read the Qur’an, pray 5 times a day (since Allah ordered us to pray, and Muhammad PBUH, who Allah ordered us to follow, showed us how to pray), give out money to the poor, believe in the angels, the past prophets, the past books and that they’ve been distorted.
If I stumble upon something that I don’t understand, I do like Allah told us to do in V4:59 and search for the answer in the Qur’an and the Hadiths or ask people who are more knowledgeable about them to help me understand (I go to trusted sources only and make sure to judge with my mind if it makes any sense and compare from other sources)

Your qurans call disbelievers the worst of creatures and najas which means filthy. This is why non muslims are not permitted to enter the 2 holy cities of mecca and medina.
“the worst of creatures” I believe you mean the verse 98:6, where Allah described those who denied the truth despite having evidence that it is the truth, as both Jews and Christians had prophecies in their books about the birth of Muhammad and him being a prophet.
Can you think of anything worse than a person who denies the truth while knowing it’s the truth? And can you imagine how much trouble this person can make?
Arrogance, ignorance, lies, and many more!
Now the filthy part; if I tell you someone regularly does [insert clean action here] you would consider this person to be clean, in contrast if I told you that person regularly does [insert filthy action here] you would consider them to be filthy.
Now what people consider as filthy is subjective, in Islam, things such as pre-marital sex, eating pigs, usury and many other prohibited things are considered filthy and of course the biggest of all is assigning false qualities to God saying that he has a son or a companion, or others. So based on the definition of filth in Islam, many non-muslims do things that are considered filthy and since Mecca and Madina have two of the most purest places where the purest of actions take place, no filthy actions or practices should occur. And just by being at Mecca/Madina, a non-muslim would be harboring “filthy” (according to Islam) thoughts about God. In addition to the fact they they will do things their way, like the cross gesture on their chest to say the least, therefore they must not enter.
I know islam better than most muslims do.
I’m afraid you do not, despite reading much, for the following reason:
You are deeply biased, therefore there’s a 80% chance you fell in confirmation bias throughout your reading about Islam.
Please work on this problem, it would be awesome to have a hardworking person like you actually understand Islam the right way.
Your qurans forbid asking questions. sura 5:101-102
Reading things out of context will never make you fully understand them, here, read Ibn Kathir’s tafsir (explanation) of the Aya:
يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ
(O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble...)."" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said, ""When this Ayah was revealed,
وَللَّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَـعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً
(And Hajj to the House is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can bear the journey.)3:97, they asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Is it required every year' He did not answer them, and they asked again, `Is it every year' He still did not answer them, so they asked, `Is it every year' He said,
«لَا، وَلَوْ قُلْتُ: نَعَمْ لَوَجَبَتْ وَلَوْ وَجَبَتْ لَمَا اسْتَطَعْتُم»
(No, and had I said `yes', it would have become obligated, and had it become obligated, you would not be able to bear it.) Allah sent down,
يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ
(O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.)."" At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith. The apparent wording of this Ayah indicates that we are forbidden to ask about things that if one has knowledge of, he would be sorry he had asked. Consequently, it is better to avoid such questions. rAllah's statement,
وَإِن تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ الْقُرْءَانُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ
(But if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made plain to you.) means, if you ask about things that you are prohibited from asking about, then when the revelation about them comes to the Messenger , they will be made plain for you,
وَذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ
(Verily! That is easy for Allah.) Allah said next,
عَفَا اللَّهُ عَنْهَا
(Allah has forgiven that,) what you did before this,
وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ
(and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.) Do not ask about things that do not have a ruling yet, for because of your questions, a difficult ruling may be ordained. A Hadith states,
«أَعْظَمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ جُرْمًا مَنْ سَأَلَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ لَمْ يُحَرَّمْ، فَحُرِّمَ مِنْ أَجْلِ مَسْأَلَتِه»
(The worst criminal among the Muslims is he who asks if a matter is unlawful (or not), and it becomes unlawful because of his asking about it.) It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,
«ذَرُونِي مَا تَرَكْتُكُمْ، فَإِنَّمَا أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ كَثْرَةُ سُؤَالِهِمْ وَاخْتِلَافُهُمْ عَلَى أَنْبِيَائِهِم»
(Leave me as I have left you, those before you were destroyed because of many questions and disputing with their Prophets.) An authentic Hadith also states,
«أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى فَرَضَ فَرَائِضَ فَلَا تُضَيِّعُوهَا، وَحَدَّ حُدُودًا فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا، وَحَرَّمَ أَشْيَاءَ فَلَا تَنْتَهِكُوهَا، وَسَكَتَ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ رَحْمَةً بِكُمْ غَيْرَ نِسْيَانٍ فَلَا تَسْأَلُوا عَنْهَا»
(Allah, the Most Honored, has ordained some obligations, so do not ignore them; has set some limits, so do not trespass them; has prohibited some things, so do not commit them; and has left some things without rulings, out of mercy for you, not that He forgot them, so do not ask about them.) Allah said next,
قَدْ سَأَلَهَا قَوْمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَصْبَحُواْ بِهَا كَـفِرِينَ
(Before you, a community asked such questions, then on that account they became disbelievers.) meaning, some people before your time asked such questions and they were given answers. They did not believe the answers, so they became disbelievers because of that. This occurred because these rulings were made plain to them, yet they did not benefit at all from that, for they asked about these things not to gain guidance, but only to mock and defy.
Free speech is not permitted under sharia law.
We are free to say anything as long as you’re not insulting another person or religion or of course the One who created you or the Prophet whom you should respect. Basic courtesy.
The west’s idea of free-speech is absurd and if applied on a wide scope could lead to our world becoming an uncivilized jungle. If people were free to insult anyone they wish to insult using filthy words or caricature and then calling it (criticism) then harm could spread more than peace and chaos would spread.
Criticizing muhamad or apostatizing out of islam carries a death penalty in 12 muslim countries.
Criticism is unequal to disrespect and insults, that’s for starters. For example, I would criticize Muhammad Hijab’s tone of voice and manner of speech in Ayan’s episode on Mikhaila’s podcast and say he should’ve spoken in a calmer tone and shouldn’t have attacked Ayan during his statements and addressed the main subject instead, and should’ve stated his points in a more civilized way.
Here, I criticized him. To further better my criticism I would cite credible references supporting my criticism, so that it is based on actual knowledge and not just my subjective opinion.
On the other hand, calling him names or expressing my opinions in an aggressive manner should be described as attacking him or disrespecting him rather than criticism, and if we were to call it criticism then it would be quite a terrible and uncivilized and destructive criticism.
Here, read it from a christian forum maybe that will sit better with you! https://www.christianforums.com/threads/the-difference-between-criticism-and-insult.7363616/
Regarding the death penalty, it’s not for “criticizing” the prophet rather it is for leaving Islam. A Muslim person who denies God’s qualities or assigns false qualities to him, or denies the Prophet being the messenger, or denies the books sent by Allah, or the prophets (including Issa) or the angels or denies the prohibition of certain things (I hope I didn’t miss any other points) is considered to have left Islam. Scholars can sit with him for 3 days to try to clear any misunderstanding he has and answer any of his questions and show him his way back, if it doesn’t work he is killed (not by anyone but by the law enforcement).
So don't talk to me again about opening up my mind. Will you open up your own mind and permit criticism of islam?
I believe I am open minded, or I try to be as much as possible- open to new ideas and information putting ones beliefs aside and trying to avoid biases as much as possible - but this is one thing, and accepting disrespect is another. I will not accept anyone saying bad things about Allah, the prophet, or the Qur’an. Just like you wouldn’t accept anyone *insulting* your loved ones.
I would be open-minded to hear a criticism about my parents, or myself, or any loved-one, but not insults.
On the other hand, God, the creator, or the words of God, or the man God sent to teach us (as he doesn’t speak of his own will, he only speaks what is revealed to him by God 53:3, 53:4) , should not be criticized. Because we’re talking about the One who created us, we are the mere creations, what arrogance and absurdity can one have to criticize the One who brought him into existence and if it wasn’t for him he could’ve not had a brain or a tongue to criticize with to begin with!
The only reason I’m having this “conversation” with you despite your constant disrespect to Allah, the Qur’an and the Prophet is in hopes that a hardworking person as yourself would find the right path and maybe spend even more effort in trying to let go of biases while learning, to learn more accurately. I believe that if you did so and actually opened your mind and heart to Islam, through the right sources, you’ll be a Muslim.
Speaking of your hard work, for over a year, you’ve been actively spreading information against Islam on Quora, may you tell me what your motive is? I genuinely want to know! Also, how old are you if I may ask?
Exactly which proves I was speaking the truth. Your quran is not a clear guidance.
The Quran Is Clear-Cut Evidence but Scholars May Differ in their Understanding As It Includes Muhkamaat and Mutashaabihaat Verses
https://islamqa.info/en/answers/242365/there-is-no-contradiction-between-the-description-of-the-quran-as-being-clear-and-explained-in-detail-and-the-appearance-of-the-huroof-muqattaah-in-it
These two websites are trustworthy sources of fatwa, so please, if you have any questions, ask them on these websites. Because not all sources should be trusted.
Dorar - Main Page and this is a trustworthy website for checking hadiths and their accuracy.
The foundations of islam, the 5 pillars are not mentioned in the quran. The exact formula for the shahada not mentioned, circumcision not mentioned, the exact concept of tawheed is not mentioned. The verses that talk about these concepts are highly ambiguous and contradictory. So what infrastructure are you talking about?
One thing to make clear first, of the main parts of the infrastructure is that we should obey Muhammad PBUH, and I’ve shed light on the possible wisdom of complementing the Qur’an with the seera instead of putting all the details in the Qur’an alone in my first comment, which you dodged. Making that clear, it then shows that we learn about Islam from the Qur’an aaanddd the seera, in which all things you mentioned has been taught.
Other parts of the infrastructure include but are not limited to:
Description of Allah and his names and qualities, to know who we worship
The truth about this life being a test and a temporary station and the fact that the true life comes after death
Our purpose in life and how we should live it, what we should and should not do
Rewards and punishments
Logical evidence and reminders that God is the true God and life being temporary, which include but are not limited to stories of the past generations who vanished despite their power and development.
That we should obey the Prophet who doesn’t speak or act of his mind but rather speaks only what God wants him to speak (either from the near or far sense, as in, whenever he tells us to do or not do something it isn’t from his mind but from Allah. And anything he does say he doesn’t get to say it except if Allah allows the words to come out of his mouth, like all of us).
the exact concept of tawheed is not mentioned.
This though, I’m afraid is false. There’s an entire surah dedicated to just the concept of Tawheed, surah 112, as well as many verses such as 17:23, 9:31, 2:163, 28:88, 3:18
Here are a list of ayas about tawheed:
موقع هدى القرآن الإلكتروني
There's nothing wise about verses that are incomplete and ambiguous.
The verses complete each other, and the seera makes it clear and completes the religion.
Can you have an open mind yourself and permit criticism of muhamad and islam? Will you condemn muslim countries and muslim scholars who prohibit free speech? Will you condemn those muslims who are against Charlie hebdo cartoons? Respect goes both ways you know.
I already replied to that above.
Is that why shias pray 3 times and sunnis 5?
May Allah guide the shias, they do not follow the path of the prophet the right way, like Allah ordered us. “Sunnis” are called so because they follow the sunna which is Prophet Muhammad’s teachings and actions (as well as the Qur’an of course) and so are on the right path, unlike shias who diverted from it.
I am not talking about frivolous things here. I am talking about the most fundamental aspects of islam such as the 5 pillars, circumcision, kissing the black stone, 5 daily prayers, the shahada, tawheed, etc
I wasn’t talking about frivolous things either. In the Qur’an, Allah set the basics for all of that. He told us to believe in him, and in the prophet, and told us to pray, and give out money to the poor, and to fast and to do Hajj. He just didn’t explain *how* to do those things in detail in the Qur’an, he left that to be explained through the prophet in his life. The prophet whom He ordered us to obey, multiple times in the Qur’an.
But many people still rejected him. In fact the Jews and the Christians accused him of plagiarism.
And?
They rejected him, do you have to follow them? Anyone can accuse anyone of anything, they don’t have to be right though. Logically speaking, how can someone who cannot read nor write plagiarize anything?
He even got many concepts wrong.
I would like to ask you what those are but I won’t because I still have to learn a lot about Islam and the prophet, so it won’t be beneficial, neither for me nor for you.
There's nothing poetic about the quran.
You’ll discover the opposite if you read it in Arabic, I hope you learn Arabic it will be beneficial.
So why do you have 600000 hadiths dedicated to muhamad? Throw them in the garbage then.
This is quite irrelevant to what I had said. Please go over it again.
Speak for yourself. I know a lot more about islam.
You’ve read a lot, reading doesn’t necessarily lead to knowledge nor understanding though.. I hope that you overcome bias and know more about Islam.
So don't play this game with me trying to appear all docile and loving.
I’m not trying to play any games. I’m just inviting you to re-have this discussion years down the road, because I’d love to have it after accumulating more knowledge about Islam, as I’ve said, I consider myself ignorant since I still lack knowledge about many things.
And I’m also inviting you to re-read about Islam, while actively putting your bias aside because I’m afraid you fell in conformation bias throughout your learning journey (happens to all of us!)

Your qurans call disbelievers the worst of creatures and najas which means filthy. This is why non muslims are not permitted to enter the 2 holy cities of mecca and medina.
“the worst of creatures” I believe you mean the verse 98:6, where Allah described those who denied the truth despite having evidence that it is the truth, as both Jews and Christians had prophecies in their books about the birth of Muhammad and him being a prophet.
Can you think of anything worse than a person who denies the truth while knowing it’s the truth? And can you imagine how much trouble this person can make?
Arrogance, ignorance, lies, and many more!
Now the filthy part; if I tell you someone regularly does [insert clean action here] you would consider this person to be clean, in contrast if I told you that person regularly does [insert filthy action here] you would consider them to be filthy.
Now what people consider as filthy is subjective, in Islam, things such as pre-marital sex, eating pigs, usury and many other prohibited things are considered filthy and of course the biggest of all is assigning false qualities to God saying that he has a son or a companion, or others. So based on the definition of filth in Islam, many non-muslims do things that are considered filthy and since Mecca and Madina have two of the most purest places where the purest of actions take place, no filthy actions or practices should occur. And just by being at Mecca/Madina, a non-muslim would be harboring “filthy” (according to Islam) thoughts about God. In addition to the fact they they will do things their way, like the cross gesture on their chest to say the least, therefore they must nor not enter.
I know islam better than most muslims do.
I’m afraid you do not, despite reading much, for the following reasons:¶

1- reason:¶

You are deeply biased, therefore there’s a 80% chance you fell in confirmation bias throughout your reading about Islam.¶

2- You don’t know Arabic, so you’re missing out on a LOT of information as well as understanding.¶

Please work on these two problems, this problem, it would be awesome to have a hardworking person like you actually understand Islam the right way.
Your qurans forbid asking questions. sura 5:101-102
Reading things out of context will never make you fully understand them, here, read Ibn Kathir’s tafsir (explanation) of the Aya:
يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ
(O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble...)."" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said, ""When this Ayah was revealed,
وَللَّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَـعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً
(And Hajj to the House is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can bear the journey.)3:97, they asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Is it required every year' He did not answer them, and they asked again, `Is it every year' He still did not answer them, so they asked, `Is it every year' He said,
«لَا، وَلَوْ قُلْتُ: نَعَمْ لَوَجَبَتْ وَلَوْ وَجَبَتْ لَمَا اسْتَطَعْتُم»
(No, and had I said `yes', it would have become obligated, and had it become obligated, you would not be able to bear it.) Allah sent down,
يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ
(O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.)."" At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith. The apparent wording of this Ayah indicates that we are forbidden to ask about things that if one has knowledge of, he would be sorry he had asked. Consequently, it is better to avoid such questions. rAllah's statement,
وَإِن تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ الْقُرْءَانُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ
(But if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made plain to you.) means, if you ask about things that you are prohibited from asking about, then when the revelation about them comes to the Messenger , they will be made plain for you,
وَذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ

(Leave me as I have left you, those before you were destroyed because of many questions and disputing with their Prophets.) An authentic Hadith also states,

Please work on these two problems, it would be awesome to have a hardworking person like you actually understand Islam the right way.
Your qurans forbid asking questions. sura 5:101-102
Reading things out of context will never make you fully understand them, here, read Ibn Kathir’s tafsir (explanation) of the Aya:
يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ
(O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble...)."" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said, ""When this Ayah was revealed,
وَللَّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَـعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً
(And Hajj to the House is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can bear the journey.)3:97, they asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Is it required every year' He did not answer them, and they asked again, `Is it every year' He still did not answer them, so they asked, `Is it every year' He said,
«لَا، وَلَوْ قُلْتُ: نَعَمْ لَوَجَبَتْ وَلَوْ وَجَبَتْ لَمَا اسْتَطَعْتُم»
(No, and had I said `yes', it would have become obligated, and had it become obligated, you would not be able to bear it.) Allah sent down,
يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ
(O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.)."" At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith. The apparent wording of this Ayah indicates that we are forbidden to ask about things that if one has knowledge of, he would be sorry he had asked. Consequently, it is better to avoid such questions. rAllah's statement,
وَإِن تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ الْقُرْءَانُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ
(But if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made plain to you.) means, if you ask about things that you are prohibited from asking about, then when the revelation about them comes to the Messenger , they will be made plain for you,
وَذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ
(Verily! That is easy for Allah.) Allah said next,
عَفَا اللَّهُ عَنْهَا
(Allah has forgiven that,) what you did before this,
وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ
(and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.) Do not ask about things that do not have a ruling yet, for because of your questions, a difficult ruling may be ordained. A Hadith states,
«أَعْظَمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ جُرْمًا مَنْ سَأَلَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ لَمْ يُحَرَّمْ، فَحُرِّمَ مِنْ أَجْلِ مَسْأَلَتِه»
(The worst criminal among the Muslims is he who asks if a matter is unlawful (or not), and it becomes unlawful because of his asking about it.) It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,
«ذَرُونِي مَا تَرَكْتُكُمْ، فَإِنَّمَا أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ كَثْرَةُ سُؤَالِهِمْ وَاخْتِلَافُهُمْ عَلَى أَنْبِيَائِهِم»
(Leave me as I have left you, those before you were destroyed because of many questions and disputing with their Prophets.) An authentic Hadith also states,
«أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى فَرَضَ فَرَائِضَ فَلَا تُضَيِّعُوهَا، وَحَدَّ حُدُودًا فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا، وَحَرَّمَ أَشْيَاءَ فَلَا تَنْتَهِكُوهَا، وَسَكَتَ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ رَحْمَةً بِكُمْ غَيْرَ نِسْيَانٍ فَلَا تَسْأَلُوا عَنْهَا»
(Allah, the Most Honored, has ordained some obligations, so do not ignore them; has set some limits, so do not trespass them; has prohibited some things, so do not commit them; and has left some things without rulings, out of mercy for you, not that He forgot them, so do not ask about them.) Allah said next,
قَدْ سَأَلَهَا قَوْمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَصْبَحُواْ بِهَا كَـفِرِينَ
(Before you, a community asked such questions, then on that account they became disbelievers.) meaning, some people before your time asked such questions and they were given answers. They did not believe the answers, so they became disbelievers because of that. This occurred because these rulings were made plain to them, yet they did not benefit at all from that, for they asked about these things not to gain guidance, but only to mock and defy.
Free speech is not permitted under sharia law.
We are free to say anything as long as you’re not insulting another person or religion or of course the One who created you or the Prophet whom you should respect. Basic courtesy.
The west’s idea of free-speech is absurd and if applied on a wide scope would lead to our world becoming an uncivilized jungle. If people were free to insult anyone they wish to insult using filthy words or caricature and then calling it (criticism) then no peace would exist.
Criticizing muhamad or apostatizing out of islam carries a death penalty in 12 muslim countries.
Criticism is unequal to disrespect and insults, that’s for starters. For example, I would criticize Muhammad Hijab’s tone of voice and manner of speech in Ayan’s episode on Mikhaila’s podcast and say he should’ve spoken in a calmer tone and shouldn’t have attacked Ayan during his statements, and should’ve stated his points in a more civilized way.
Here, I criticized him. To further better my criticism I would cite credible references supporting my criticism, so that it is based on actual knowledge and not just my subjective opinion.
On the other hand, calling him names or expressing my opinions in an aggressive manner should be described as attacking him or disrespecting him rather than criticism, and if we were to call it criticism then it would be quite a terrible and uncivilized and destructive criticism.
Here, read it from a christian forum maybe that will sit well with you! https://www.christianforums.com/threads/the-difference-between-criticism-and-insult.7363616/
Regarding the death penalty, it’s not for “criticizing” the prophet rather it is for leaving Islam. A Muslim person who denies God’s qualities or assigns false qualities to him, or denies the Prophet being the messenger, or denies the books sent by Allah, or the prophets (including Issa) or the angels or denies the prohibition of certain things (I hope I didn’t miss any other points) breaks his Islam.
So don't talk to me again about opening up my mind. Will you open up your own mind and permit criticism of islam?
I believe I am open minded, or I try to be as much as possible- open to new ideas and information putting ones beliefs aside and trying to avoid biases as much as possible - but this is one thing, and accepting disrespect is another. I will not accept anyone saying bad things about Allah, the prophet, or the Qur’an. Just like you wouldn’t accept anyone *insulting* your loved ones.
I would be open-minded to hear a criticism about my parents, or myself, or any loved-one, but not insults.
On the other hand, God, the creator, or the words of God, or the man God sent to teach us (as he doesn’t speak of his own will, he only speaks what is revealed to him by God 53:3, 53:4) , should not be criticized. Because we’re talking about the One who created us, we are the mere creations, what arrogance and absurdity can one have to criticize the One who brought him into existence and if it wasn’t for him he could’ve not had a brain or a tongue to criticize with to begin with!
The only reason I’m having this “conversation” with you despite your constant disrespect to Allah, the Qur’an and the Prophet is in hopes that a hardworking person as yourself would find the right path and maybe spend even more effort in trying to let go of biases while learning, to learn more accurately. I believe that if you did so and actually opened your mind and heart to Islam, through the right sources, you’ll be a Muslim.
Speaking of your hard work, for over a year, you’ve been actively spreading information against Islam on Quora, may you tell me what your motive is? I genuinely want to know! Also, how old are you if I may ask?
Exactly which proves I was speaking the truth. Your quran is not a clear guidance.
The Quran Is Clear-Cut Evidence but Scholars May Differ in their Understanding As It Includes Muhkamaat and Mutashaabihaat Verses
https://islamqa.info/en/answers/242365/there-is-no-contradiction-between-the-description-of-the-quran-as-being-clear-and-explained-in-detail-and-the-appearance-of-the-huroof-muqattaah-in-it
The foundations of islam, the 5 pillars are not mentioned in the quran. The exact formula for the shahada not mentioned, circumcision not mentioned, the exact concept of tawheed is not mentioned. The verses that talk about these concepts are highly ambiguous and contradictory. So what infrastructure are you talking about?
One thing to make clear first, of the main parts of the infrastructure is that we should obey Muhammad PBUH, and I’ve shed light on the possible wisdom of complementing the Qur’an with the seera instead of putting all the details in the Qur’an alone in my first comment, which you dodged. Making that clear, it then shows that we learn about Islam from the Qur’an aaanddd the seera, in which all things you mentioned has been taught.
Other parts of the infrastructure include but are not limited to:
Description of Allah and his names and qualities, to know who we worship
The truth about this life being a test and a temporary station and the fact that the true life comes after death
Our purpose in life and how we should live it, what we should and should not do
Rewards and punishments
Logical evidence and reminders that God is the true God and life being temporary, which include but are not limited to stories of the past generations who vanished despite their power and development.
That we should obey the Prophet who doesn’t speak or act of his mind but rather speaks only what God wants him to speak (either from the near or far sense, as in, whenever he tells us to do or not do something it isn’t from his mind but from Allah. And anything he does say he doesn’t get to say it except if Allah allows the words to come out of his mouth, like all of us).
the exact concept of tawheed is not mentioned.
This though, I’m afraid is false. There’s an entire surah dedicated to just the concept of Tawheed, surah 112, as well as many verses such as 17:23, 9:31, 2:163, 28:88, 3:18
Here are a list of ayas about tawheed:
موقع هدى القرآن الإلكتروني
There's nothing wise about verses that are incomplete and ambiguous.
The verses complete each other, and the seera makes it clear and completes the religion.
Can you have an open mind yourself and permit criticism of muhamad and islam? Will you condemn muslim countries and muslim scholars who prohibit free speech? Will you condemn those muslims who are against Charlie hebdo cartoons? Respect goes both ways you know.
I already replied to that above.
Is that why shias pray 3 times and sunnis 5?
May Allah guide the shias, they do not follow the path of the prophet the right way, like Allah ordered us. “Sunnis” are called so because they follow the sunna which is Prophet Muhammad’s teachings and actions (as well as the Qur’an of course) and so are on the right path, unlike shias who diverted from it.
I am not talking about frivolous things here. I am talking about the most fundamental aspects of islam such as the 5 pillars, circumcision, kissing the black stone, 5 daily prayers, the shahada, tawheed, etc
I wasn’t talking about frivolous things either. In the Qur’an, Allah set the basics for all of that. He told us to believe in him, and in the prophet, and told us to pray, and give out money to the poor, and to fast and to do Hajj. He just didn’t explain *how* to do those things in detail in the Qur’an, he left that to be explained through the prophet in his life. The prophet whom He ordered us to obey, multiple times in the Qur’an.
But many people still rejected him. In fact the Jews and the Christians accused him of plagiarism.
And?
They rejected him, do you have to follow them? Anyone can accuse anyone of anything, they don’t have to be right though. Logically speaking, how can someone who cannot read nor write plagiarize anything?
He even got many concepts wrong.
I would like to ask you what those are but I won’t because I still have to learn a lot about Islam and the prophet, so it won’t be beneficial, neither for me nor for you.
There's nothing poetic about the quran.
You’ll discover the opposite if you read it in Arabic, I hope you learn Arabic it will be beneficial.
So why do you have 600000 hadiths dedicated to muhamad? Throw them in the garbage then.
This is quite irrelevant to what I had said. Please go over it again.
Speak for yourself. I know a lot more about islam.
You’ve read a lot, reading doesn’t necessarily lead to knowledge nor understanding though.. I hope that you overcome bias and know more about Islam.
So don't play this game with me trying to appear all docile and loving.
I’m not trying to play any games. I’m just inviting you to re-have this discussion years down the road, because I’d love to have it after accumulating more knowledge about Islam, as I’ve said, I consider myself ignorant since I still lack knowledge about many things.
And I’m also inviting you to re-read about Islam, while actively putting your bias aside because I’m afraid you fell in conformation bias throughout your learning journey (happens to all of us!)

Alsalamu A’laikum,
Allah ordered us to follow his teachings in the Qur’an as well as follow Prophet Muhammad PBUH (Obviously we need to know his life-seera- and hadiths to do that).
It was mentioned multiple times in the Qur’an:
3:32 “Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Obey Allah and His Messenger.” If they still turn away, then truly Allah does not like the disbelievers.”
3:132 “Obey Allah and the Messenger, so you may be shown mercy.”
4:59 “O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Should you disagree on anything, then refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is the best and fairest resolution.”
5:92 “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware! But if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”
8:1 “They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.”
8:20 “O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear ˹his call˺.”
8:46 “Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another, or you would be discouraged and weakened. Persevere! Surely Allah is with those who persevere.”
24:54 “Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for his duty1 and you are responsible for yours.2 And if you obey him, you will be ˹rightly˺ guided. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.””
47:33 “O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not let your deeds be in vain.
58:13 “Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultations ˹with him˺? Since you are unable to do so, and Allah has turned to you in mercy, then ˹continue to˺ establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.”
64:12 “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger! But if you turn away, then Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”
I hope I didn’t miss any aya.
Allah’s words are more then enough, but Allah wants us to obey the Prophet and so we must obey Allah by obeying Prophet Muhammad. Once you know more about him it will be a pleasure following him, as he was a straight man, kind, honest and truly a role model, which makes so much sense that Allah told us to follow him. Prophet Muhammad does things inspired by Allah, so he’s the perfect example to follow. The Qur’an has the rules and Prophet Muhammad’s life is the perfect application of those rules. So knowing his actions, we’ll have an even greater understanding of the Qur’an and it will make it easier for us to follow the rules, as we can see the rules embodied in a person’s actions in adition to them being written in the Qur’an.
May Allah guide you.us.

1- Respect other people’s beliefs even if you don’t agree with them, by doing so you respect the people themselves, and that’s what all humans should do towards other humans.
2- With all the respect, you don’t look like someone who attempted learning about Islam, the Qur’an nor the Prophet, instead you look like you only read them to argue, not looking for the truth but looking for things that don’t conform with your beliefs to criticize.
In order to truly understand something, you must first open your mind. Kindly do that.
And indeed, despite giving guidelines on the most detailed things in life (one example being 24:58) The Qur’an didn’t always mention the exact details of these guidelines are not always mentioned (we were told to pray, but the Qur’an didn’t mention the form of that prayer, Allah only mentioned the direction we should face while praying, which is an important).
Think of it as a building, the Qur’an cares about the engineering of our life, caring about the infrastructure and the main big things, the big picture. While Allah ordered Prophet Muhammad to show us how that building should look like, the architecture of that building. (Or just look at it like a normal person would: Qur’an: Main points/headlines/really important details, Prophet Muhammad’s teachings/life: the main points explained and illustrated in more depth)
It’s also really important to note that many of the Qur’an’s verses were brought down upon Prophet Muhammad at certain events, which is pretty wise if you think about it (Allah is the Wisest).
Can you think with me for a second, with an open mind, if you want to set rules for people, and it has to do with almost all their life-matters, and if you wrote these rules with aaallll their details in a book, how long of a book would that be?
Now, putting in mind people’s nature of easily getting bored, would people read all that? Also put in mind that people don’t remember most details about things they read, would you proceed to put all the details anyway?
In contrast, given the information as stories, people have more capacity focusing and reading and they recall information better. Even better, make a good role model illustrate how things should be done and how we should go about life.
so, written rules in great detail < written rules and main points embedded in stories + a role model illustrating *practical* things in detail.
And put an emphasis on *practical*, as most of the practical details are rather practically illustrated by Prophet Muhammad than explained in the Qur’an, can it make any more sense?sense?
Compare the amount of detail given about prayers (practical) in the Qur’an with the amount of details given about the division of wealth (not nearly as practical).
Regarding the point you mentioned about the Prophet’s illiteracy, if it wasn’t for his illiteracy people wouldn’t believe the Qur’an was Allah’s words, and rightly so, because the arabs were sooo good at poetry and linguistics, so if he was as good at poetry as them and mastered his language as they did their accusation of him being a poet would’ve been impossible to disbelieve.
And why hasn’t his wives/companions/parents names be mentioned? Why would they? This isn’t about him, the Qur’an is about the big concepts, remember? We learn through their actions and from their life, but that isn’t the purpose of the Qur’an. Also if it were mentioned, people would suspect more that the Prophet wrote the Qur’an himself, and if he did write it himself no doubt would he have boasted and immortalized his special loved one’s, eh?
I will not mention any more points, for you and I both need to learn more before getting into a discussion about Islam. Otherwise it would be absurd, two ignorant people talking is a waste of time. And I call us both ignorant because we do not know enough. I may not know how much you’ve read but it shows through your aggressive language and as I mentioned above, in order to truly learn and understand you must approach the subject with an open-mind.
So please, let us both learn more, and maybe we can come back to this discussion a couple of years from now, or not, it doesn’t matter, I just hope you learn to learn because you seem like a smart person.
I advise you to watch Jordan Peterson’s discussions BTW, not related to Islam, but in general, we can all learn from how he approaches new topics with a genuine desire to understand.

58:13 “Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultations ˹with him˺? Since you are unable to do so, and Allah has turned to you in mercy, then ˹continue to˺ establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.”
64:12 “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger! But if you turn away, then Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”
I hope I didn’t miss any aya.
Allah’s words are more then enough, but Allah wants us to obey the Prophet and so we must obey Allah by obeying Prophet Muhammad. Once you know more about him it will be a pleasure following him, as he was a straight man, kind, honest and truly a role model, which makes so much sense that Allah told us to follow him. Prophet Muhammad does things inspired by Allah, so he’s the perfect example to follow. The Qura’an Qur’an has the rules and Prophet Muhammad’s life is the perfect application of those rules. So knowing his actions, we’ll have an even greater understanding of the Qura’an Qur’an and it will make it easier for us to follow the rules, as we can see the rules embodied in a person’s actions in adition to them being written in the Qura’an.Qur’an.
May Allah guide you.

Where did Allah say the Quran is not enough and you need hadith?
Alsalamu A’laikum, Allah swt did not say that the Qur’an is not enough. Nevertheless, He did order us to obey Prophet Muhammad PBUH, and we’d only be able to do so through knowing the hadiths and the seera (his life) It was mentioned multiple times in the Qura’an: 3:32 “Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Obey Allah and His Messenger.” If they still turn away, then truly Allah does not like the disbelievers.” 3:132 “Obey Allah and the Messenger, so you may be shown mercy.” 4:59 “O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Should you disagree on anything, then refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is the best and fairest resolution.” 5:92 “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware! But if you turn away, then know that O…

Alsalamu A’laikum,
Allah ordered us to follow his teachings in the Qura’an as well as follow Prophet Muhammad PBUH (Obviously we need to know his life-seera- and hadiths to do that).
It was mentioned multiple times in the Qura’an:
3:32 “Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Obey Allah and His Messenger.” If they still turn away, then truly Allah does not like the disbelievers.”
3:132 “Obey Allah and the Messenger, so you may be shown mercy.”
4:59 “O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Should you disagree on anything, then refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is the best and fairest resolution.”
5:92 “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware! But if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”
8:1 “They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.”
8:20 “O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear ˹his call˺.”
8:46 “Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another, or you would be discouraged and weakened. Persevere! Surely Allah is with those who persevere.”
24:54 “Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for his duty1 and you are responsible for yours.2 And if you obey him, you will be ˹rightly˺ guided. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.””
47:33 “O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not let your deeds be in vain.
58:13 “Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultations ˹with him˺? Since you are unable to do so, and Allah has turned to you in mercy, then ˹continue to˺ establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.”

I cut myself too, even a week ago was the last time I did. I don’t know if I feel depression or not, but my mind keeps me from sleeping, it’s like my eyes could even open widely for two days or more, but I’m so tired and my head is full of things that make me blame myself again and again.
I feel like no one will understand even none of members in my family. I feel like I don’t belong with anyone or anything.
I don’t know if I’ll ever get help. But I’m not surprised if I won’t.

Wow! I love this. Gunna get it printed on my wall

· Feb 29
How do I forget my ex? It’s been 7 years and I still miss him, I know every logical reason of why I shouldn’t and that he wants nothing to do with me. I’ve accepted that, yet I still look for him in everything. I can’t understand why.
*get ready for a veeeery long answer* I understand, I was in your position for 5 years. You know you should move on, your mind knows and yet your heart still doesn't understand. Every time you explain to your heart - you stay reasonable and firm, your heart tries understanding and you finally get it, until that one thought, that one pang in the chest and you are back to square one, as if they broke your heart just today. The pain of their absence comes back and nothing seems worth it anymore. It’s unbearable, it kills you slowly, everyday. It’s a process I went through for many many years. He is ‘THE ONE’, the only person you want, the person that you imagine the rest of your life with because he’s the only one you love; you will never be able to love anyone else, not when his name is written across your heart, engraved in your soul, his memories on repeat in your mind devouring your very being. It breaks your heart everyday that he’s not there with you. And what breaks your heart more is that, its a choice he’s made, and you’re the one having to live with it. Nothing makes sense anymore. Nothing makes sense without him. At times you might even ponder if this is the life you are destined to live, in despair, in pain, in regret. That’s what I often wondered, a few good days, few bad but I could never forget him. He never left me, his ghost, always there, following me around. That was what I struggled with over the past few years, the longing always stayed and never went away. And even I couldn’t understand why, what magic did he do to me, that even after he left me all those years ago, he’s still in my life? The process was very long but in the end… I accepted, I won’t, I won’t forget him. I will love him forever. And the pain will always be there. I couldn’t understand it, and no one else could either. No one could make it better. I slowly realised, Not even him. He couldn’t make it better either. Because he wasn’t the same person anymore. What I was holding onto wasn’t there anymore. It never was there anymore the day he decided to end it, for him it was over. I got to talk to my ex after many years had passed, and he told my all about his life, all the things he did, had done, and nonchalantly told me about his gf, now ex, remind me to tell you all about it. I read his messages in disbelief, I watched my world shatter in front of me. The person whom I spent years pining over never once thought about me, and still on the day we talked, he didn’t care about me. I then realised, if I had to recount the last 5 years, I’d remember none of it because I spent that many years in pain, my best years were spent in sadness, over this guy leaving me. The guy whom didn’t exist anymore, the person whom I loved died with our love. That was when it was over for me. And it was a sure done decision, he never looked back, he never will and now I knew I would never look back too. He won’t understand the pain and hurt you’ve been through because he’s living his life with no care in the world. He doesn’t spend endless nights crying, wishing, hoping you would return. He is okay without you. He will be okay without you. And you will be okay without him too. It’s up to you to start today. Begin your self love journey and that’s when you will never accept anything less. It’s hard I know, I am going through it too that’s why I am here, but what keeps me sane is it’s his decision. It’s his choice, it’s his loss. He has lost someone that loves him so dearly, that we continued loving someone even though everything made more sense not to. The way we love has no bounds, we love so deeply, that even we can’t explain it ourselves. and don’t you think this love we have is of such value that someone worthy deserves this love? Why not give this love to yourself? Who is more worthy of this love than yourself? Who will love you the most? See your own value, how much your love is worth, place it on the highest pedestal possible and don’t give it to someone that will never be able to value and appreciate it. The person you’re looking for isn’t there anymore, but the person you can find, is yourself. I hope this answer helps you a little bit. Good luck in your journey to heal, and never lose how unapologetically you love. It’s a quality that makes you.. YOU!

What is antimatter?
Have you ever observed that everything around us is symmetric? I mean everything exist in pairs. Day and night, yin and yang, Male and female, north and South Pole, truth and lies, the list is endless….. Everything we see around us has most likely an anti self. If we look at the bigger picture, the matter (which is literally everything around us) too has a lesser known anti-self called “antimatter”. Surprised? Well, you should if it was 1928, the year when Paul Dirac proposed its existence. He brilliantly pointed out that Einstein’s equation E=mc2 only consider mass “m” to be a positive entity. However he showed mathematically that mass too can exhibit negative properties. Hence the idea of antimatter was born. It took 4 more years until Carl Anderson discovered positron experimentally. At the atomic level antimatter is just like matter but with opposite polarity. They have anti-proton (proton with negative charge) in place of proton and anti electron (called positron) in place of electron. These anti-subatomic particles when combined together create antimatter like anti-hyrdrogen, anti-oxygen and consequently anti-water and much more. OK,you got the basic idea. Why does it matter? Now you might be thinking why antimatter? What’s the big deal about it? There is one word answers for that: annihilation. When anti matter comes in contact with matter it annihilates in accordance with the equation E=mc^2.Just imagine the amount of energy with just 1 kg of matter and antimatter? Put m=2 and square the value of c(3×108 m/s) in the above equation.That’s 1000 times more energy you can get from any nuclear fission!!Even with 200gms you can plan a return trip to Mars!(No wonder NASA is currently working on an antimatter engine).No fumes, no byproduct just pure energy. It’s the purest form of energy that we can lay our hands on. So where is antimatter? We don’t see it lying around some corner! Where is the symmetry we were talking about? According to physicists, during big bang tremendous amount of energy was released which should have condensed to give equal amount of antimatter and matter. This explanation was found to be in agreement with experimental results obtained. So the next big question is why we see only matter when both were created in equal amounts initially? This is the 2nd most debatable question on antimatter. The first one? Hang on a little bit. The ubiquity of matter over antimatter was first explained by Sarkharov.He suggested that antimatter particles might have decayed a little bit faster than their counterparts (For geeks it’s called CP violation). In simpler terms an imbalance existed between the amounts after Bing bang. This imbalance was of the order one billion one to one billion. So this extra ‘one’ created the leftovers that we see around us (stars, galaxies, us). Another theory that attempts to explain the dominance of matter over anti matter is the “theory of regions”. According to this, antimatter does exist collectively in a far off region in the universe. The only problem is that we haven’t discovered that region yet. But again people question that if this is to be true then this antimatter region must begin from somewhere at its boundary where it has to come in contact with matter and emit γ-radiations. But we haven’t detected such radiation from any corner of universe yet. So sayonara to this theory for now! So the conclusion is “we can’t find it therefore we can’t make it”. However, people who know about CERN would disagree with this statement because CERN is the world leader in synthesizing antimatter! Yes you heard it right, we have successfully synthesized antimatter (or more precisely anti atom) in our labs. How do they make it? Remember the equation E=mc^2?Scientist thought that if mass can be used to create tremendous amount of energy then maybe condensing tremendous amount of energy may lead us mass! It’s like hammering zero to get 1 and -1 Or solving x2=4 to get -2 and 2 as solutions.The sun in fact produces large amount of antimatter naturally everyday due to its high energy density. Another method used by CERN which involve accelerating protons through a 12.7km long underground tunnel during which they gain energy equivalent to 2.7GeV and are bombarded on heavy elements like lead. Heavy elements have heavy nucleus that means they experience Strong repulsive force from protons present in nucleus. This leads to change in their trajectory, change in their velocity causing acceleration. This causes change in their energy level hence emitting anti protons along with some other subatomic particles. This is how you make anti particles. And if you want to make antiparticles at your home without having going through the trouble of hiring the CERN for one day, I have something for you. A banana! Yes it’s a radioactive food and it decays periodically to give positron (anti-electron).You might not beat CERN with it but at least you can brag about it to your neighbors! Believe me antimatter is currently the most expensive thing on the planet with its 1mg costing around $100 billion! Ever wondered how you would trap antimatter? A container used for storing antimatter will itself be made of matter, so they’ll love to annihilate each other. This might sound a bit disappointing but if we collect all the antimatter produced at CERN till this date it would be just enough for lighting a bulb for few seconds. We get nearly 1billionth of energy required to produce antimatter. Antimatter in everyday life It might come as surprise that apart from being a potential rocket fuel and deadliest weapon till date antimatter is quite famous in medical industry. Curing cancer by bombarding anti proton on target cells to live imaging of internal organs using positron emission tomography (PET), antimatter fits almost everywhere. But the real problem is that we don’t know enough of it. What we have known till today came from experimental data only. We don’t know whether it will fall upwards or downwards (This is the most debatable question on antimatter) or how to stabilize heavier anti-elements. A concrete theory is what we need to accelerate our progress in this field. I believe that few years from now we will have that theory because it is the solution of one of the major global problem of 21st century: Energy crisis Thanks for reading :-)

Can the LHC at CERN create black holes?
No, it cannot and never will, no matter what size of particle accelerator we are talking about. For one, the whole mania about CERN creating a black hole and destroying earth comes from a severe misunderstanding: that a black hole will swallow everything around it ad infinitum and keep expanding and swallowing. Well, so does a star. A black hole, seen from outside the Schwarzschild radius, is no different than a star with the same mass (the only difference is that for a regular star the Schwarzschild radius lies inside it). You can have planets in stable orbit around a black hole, just like those around a star. No difference there, the planets are not ‘sucked in’ any faster than a regular star would attract them. Second, there might exist hypothesised objects that are small at the quantum level but dense enough to create a Schwarzschild radius outside of their size. Somebody had the brilliant idea to call these Micro black holes (which is essentially what they are, but from a psychological point of view any other name might have been more suited). These objects, because of their extremely small size, might even be created at extremely low energies (compared to cosmological scales) like the energy that is attainable in the LHC. Do you see where this is going? Somebody read about #2, the LHC potentially creating micro black holes, and applied misunderstanding #1 by incorrectly deducing that these micro black holes will grow, swallowing everything on their path, eventually destroying earth (and who knows, maybe the whole solar system). The thing is, those micro black holes are unstable. They evaporate instantly, before being able to do any ‘damage’. And this is something we know 100% sure: to create a black hole, you need an object with around 5 times the mass of the sun. This object will be a typical star, radiating energy through fusion, living at least several billions of years before having depleted all its fuel and - eventually - collapsing into a black hole. Theoretically, anything with a mass smaller than 5 suns *might* be artificially made into a black hole (if some alien master superrace knows how to compress a material so densely, and how to avoid the fusion part), however this would be unstable anyhow and evaporate. Furthermore, íf micro black holes are a real thing (so far none have been observed), that would be another proof that they evaporate instantly. Because they could (and would) be created everywhere, all the time, due to quantum fluctuations. If they didn’t evaporate we would’ve been f**d already. So maybe they exist, maybe they don’t, either way, we’re safe. So then you say, “OK, forget about micro black holes, what about the LHC creating a real black hole?”. Like I said, never gonna happen, no matter what size of particle accelerator we are talking about. To create a real black hole we need (at least) 5 solar masses worth of energy, and in the whole solar system we have only 1 solar mass worth of energy! So even if we could exploit all energy currently hidden (as ‘unspent’ mass) in the sun, we would only be at 20% of our need. Rest assured, the LHC will not destroy anything (except its own magnets ).

Since autism is a disability, why do so many autists not want a cure, assuming there was one?
Imagine an alternate reality where most humans don’t have a sense of smell, but you do. It’s wonderful in some ways; you can notice things that most people can’t. Unfortunately, it comes with a drawback, which is that a lot of things stink. People don’t use deodorant, because why would they? So you try to get along, but you can’t not notice smells. You have reactions to things that normal people don’t. Normal people think you’re weird. You can’t even explain what smell is like to them, because the language doesn’t have a word for “smell” or “odor” or “stink”. Normal people have decided that you have a disability, because you can’t function in a perfectly normal environment like a room full of hot, sweaty people. Assuming there’s a cure, would you want one? Would you give up your ability to smell flowers and bread and other pleasant smells, just so you can fit into society? Ah. But there *is* a cure. All we have to do is to get the “normal” people to use deodorant. To realize that the “smellers” aren’t just making up their claims of unease and discomfort. And there’s a similar “cure” for autism in our world — to have non-autistic people be more understanding and accommodating for us. That’s the cure I want.

What are some of the challenges faced by people with autism?
1. Feeling like an alien. 2. Very high risk of being sexually, physically and mentally abused. 3. Being misunderstood, even by those closest to you ie family. 4. Feeling isolated and alone even when you're surrounded by people. 5. Having such vivid feelings that they overwhelm your entire body and not being able to express yourself “properly"" (how we intend) 6. Being bullied, teased and villianised by NTs that make fun of you to make themselves feel better or because you unintentionally offended them. 7. Struggling with suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety cause this world is not made for people like you. 8. Finding it hard to make friends cause people don't get you or don't like you and you don't even know what you've done. 9. Being in danger from fucked up people that target you or generally harm others and you happen to not realise the immediate danger you're in, until you're in it. 10. Percieving the world around you in a way that is different to almost everyone else- Hoping for a better society as you watch them kill the world around you that you love.

What was the last thing your child said to you before they passed away?
My son told me to try the cashews he was eating. He pranked me with a very spicy cashew. He knew I wasn't fond of hot foods. I said OMG…he laughed, then told me to wake him up at 9a.m. I wish I could have, but he died peacefully in his sleep from cardiac arrest. My boy left me laughing.

It is at this point that you betrayed your disdain for religion.. funny that you are the first to mention it despite having gone highly technical.. totally technical all along, almost neglecting the essence of the whole debate/discussion which to me is the thin line between scientific and intuitve choices as regards preservation of human lives.
Don't you think you've made your point and should rest instead of trying too hard to prove the efficacy of science and the exigencies of professional ethics that most are already aware of.

I think most people are missing the OP's main point which isn't necessarily the test and the results whether positive or otherwise… it was the attitude she was most disappointed with and maybe the somewhat disregard for the emotional connection/attachment the mother would have developed at that point in time.
I daresay that many doctors tend to be less than mindful of their patients’ vulnerabilities sometimes and that I find most inhuman… understandable yes... just because they are used to similar scenarios or maybe even worse but hey, there's that thing called humanity - you can't be unmindful of it… should be the very reason you got into the profession in the first place.

What would you like to be different? Make a list of what you are missing… then write 3 solutions to each… or reach out to us to help you with the exact problems you feel are causing you to feel this way. Honestly, we are not supposed to be happy all the time. How long have you been feeling this way? Try reaching out to a professional because sometimes it gets out of control quickly. Try to keep in mind that this too shall pass. Everything is temporary and who knows maybe tomorrow at a bus station you will meet someone, who will change your life. It is a miracle that you are born - you are magic! And there are so many things to experience, you are still very young.

Yeah, but Stalin also purged his entire command structure in the 30s. Had he not been such a manic despot, maybe less people would’ve died

Why isn't 2^4; 2*2=4, 4*4=16, 16*16=256, 256*256=65536?
Because to raise something to a power is shorthand for multiplying it by itself that many times.
2^4 means 2 × 2 × 2 ×2 = 16. If you wanted to express your equation in terms of power of twos, it equals (2^1) × (2^1) = 4, (2^2) × (2^2) = 16, (2^4) × (2^4) = 256, (2^8) × (2^8) = 65,536, or (2^16) = 65,536

If 12x = 144, what is x?
Here you simply divide both sides by 12:
12x/12 = 144/12,
and afterwords you get
x = 12, because 12 and 12 form 1, and 144 is the square of 12.

Rising Above Narcissism
·
2y
Why do some narcissist like to keep back ups (side piece)? And how do they decide who becomes. The side piece?
Persons with Narcissistic Personality Disorder have an incurable mental disorder. They are pathological liars. They are serial cheaters. They consider all persons who have been in a “relationship” with them their possessions for life. These are all fake relationships as the mentally disordered individual is not capable of loving anyone. They don’t have one side piece, they have multiple side pieces … a Narc Harem. They collect people to have sex with. If one isn’t available, they cut and paste the text message to the next one on the list. Still concerned about who becomes the “Side Piece”?

I agree! It’s common sense to respect one’s trust. Regardless of what they did. You guys were once together, do not betray anyone’s trust. And do not expect a medal of maturity just because you chose not to betray someone.

Hey, I’m sorry that you’re going through this rough patch. One of my coping mechanisms is to embrace whatever bitter episodes of my past, acknowledge that it is a part of me and try to learn from the experiences and try to see the good in it. From that, I taught and remind myself constantly to let go (though it’s not easy-cant be done overnight, at least for me haha) and let God.. for the things that are beyond my control, I let the Universe runs its course. I felt calmer, more focused and less and less triggered by those episodes. It’s a process that requires time and willpower. Can’t say that I’ve fully recovered from the trauma but things seem to get better. At least that’s what I’ve been trying to tell myself.
I dont know what you’ve gone through and this advice may seem too generic but I hope it helps, if not much. Hang in there. Better days are coming

You can’t say as a broad statement “they manipulate people they love”, many different people are capable of this and do it to varying degrees.
I’d like to add it’s not easy being very emotionally in tune, it’s hard to deal with the disappointment that other people aren’t worried about your best interests like they would be for someone else who is more aloof. Cancers should be greatly valued and respected for their kindness, generosity and great listening. But often it may be the other person who overlooks their positive traits and takes them for granted. Also cancer men are different to cancer women.

I agree very much about developing your observant self. It’s so hard for me to forgive people and accept all the bad in the world.. it seems so often to outweigh the good. Maybe that is just my life experience. I have a question also, what about attachment in matters of love and close relationships? How can you slow that, it’s chemical and very hard to ignore. I find it’s one of the things that affects me the most.

With the introduction of social media such as facebook, WhatsApp, Snap chat, Instagram etc, all the things you've listed so far can be known through the above mentioned. Don't you think instead of reunions facebook groups or WhatsApp groups should be created? Take a look at it. Thanks

Would this be an option I could potentially ask for?
I have a doctors who insist on more injections. I hate them. They are a waste of time for the amount of relief they provide and quite simply not a great choice for my particular ailments.
When the pain causes loss of sleep and then thorough research into the medical area of focus you learn a lot. Doctors don't particularly care for my online neuro education albeit from valid institutions, textbooks and keeping realistic.
No consult collaborations as of yet.
Very happy to hear many regaining, well , their lives back. No pun intended.

How might I better identify when the ego or self is doing the thinking? How might I gain humility?
I like to ask myself the same question on a daily basis to keep myself on a path of gratitude for what I have and don’t. Ego and selfishness have many of the same characteristics. I would go more into depth but I could write quite a bit, but quite honestly I am exhausted. Selfish of me… A teething 9-month baby boy teaches you selfishness is not possible as he is my true self. You can distinguish when your thinking is based on self by simply looking at the outcome. If you are looking for a specific outcome that is pertaining to how it affects you, there usually selfishness involved. When your thoughts are simply pure of any benefit to yourself you have gained a sense of what I like to call “doing the next right thing”. That being said you should never put yourself in a position that you fall…

How do people escape from their dysfunctional families?
Family, is well family. There is no concrete answer to this unless you are 18 and can leave on your own free will. Being abused physically, mentally and or neglected can cause for intervening with authorities immediately. The best plan is to become the best you can be. Achieve all that you can by staying focused and disciplined by your passions. Let the background noise of the family become exactly that, background noise. Prepare yourself to cope with the world, employment and surround yourself with love outside of that family. You must understand the little things you do for yourself curate your outcome when you are able to escape or distance yourself from the family. If all works out you can leave your past where it is the past and work on the present. Who knows that present someday may in…

How did you feel living in an overly dysfunctional family?
This question is quite rhetorical as I feel everyone in their own right has a dysfunctional family. I will indulge because my family is a beautiful catastrophe. My Mother and Father divorced when I was no older than 2–3. i will not go too far into detail but my mother was treated poorly and in the end cheated on with my father’s now wife and my then babysitter. I had pure rage, abandonment and pain in my heart once I was able to understand the magnitude of what had taken place. Should I have been aware of what occurred at an age when I was not able to process and cope, I don’t know. I can’t, wouldn’t and pray not to ever be in the situation that I must explain to my child why his/her parents are not living together. I moved around while the divorce process took place and spent time with my f…

You should learn with everything available to you. The only limitation is your desire. Find a way to make a contribution to an opportunity-problem you or your family has with the tools you have at hand.
If you are seeking experience, less is more. Draw your idea the sand. Watch it go away. Recall it in your mind. Draw what you love, after all, that's where we all begin.

Autocad is the industry standard for vector graphics.
It is a capable, non parametric 3d modeling application. I utilize the platform on a daily basis to produce models to generate construction contract drawings. That said, for your end use of fabrication pattern making, Autocad is the proper choice.
Be advised, the learning curve is steep. It may behoove your client or the end user of your patterns to employ an experienced contractor. You might get frustrated when an unforseen issue arises and a change is needed.
Download your free trial of Autocad and check it out. Don't let the unknown steal your voice. Learn the language and speak up, friend.
Kindly,
Adam

What’s a sign of extremely high intelligence?
When my husband and I were looking for a good elementary school for our first child, we visited a lot of schools and stood in the back of classrooms to watch the teachers give the lesson. One teacher was very rigid. He showed a photo of a small plane in the middle of a storm with lightning. A little girl raised her hand to ask a question. He kept ignoring her. Finally, perhaps because he was aware of the parents watching, he said: “What is important enough for you to interrupt my lecture on storms?” She said: “If the storm was this bad, how were they able to take this photo?” The teacher dismissed her question with: “That is not what we are talking about.” I was very impressed by the intelligence of that little girl who could automatically grasp the inherent difficulty of getting close enough to safely take that photo. I was underwhelmed by the teacher who could not think beyond the point he wanted to make. Punchline: One of the signs of high intelligence is to illuminate what appears unremarkable to the less intelligent.

Autocad Plant3D with Faro As-Built.
A forensic-quality precise 3D model of existing conditions is derived from a registered point cloud via comprehensive laser scanning. (“Modeling to the Points"" As-Built for ACAD)
Proposed capital investment is then modeled with respect to the existing conditions. Proposed P&ID component parts are digitally linked to their 3D model conterparts. (“Smart P&IDs"" Plant3D)
Automated model-to-deliverable processing (piping isometric dwgs, plan drawings, steel erection dwgs, shop fabrication dwgs). (“ISOGEN"" Plant3D)
This process minimizes field changes while ensuring fast, real-time revision of the proposed model and P&IDs.
Savings in engineering time & construction contingency are huge. Capital investment projects are installed & providing return on investment, truly, as soon as possible.

Wellbutrin is an amazing drug for my depression, but my anxiety is still awful and causing me a lot of GI symptoms. Is Buspar a good option to add to Wellbutrin or is it too mild & better to try an SSRI or SNRI?
Buspar has been a good option for anxiety for me. You can increase the dosage until you reach a therapeutic level. Good luck!

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Please look into getting these treatments. I’ve went through this before and struggled for years, but TMS truly helped me. Best of luck!

How long have you battled depression? What's your advice?
Since 2007 and it was only in the past few years that I’ve gotten to a good, manageable and thriving place since. I think what’s helped me most is having TMS therapy treatments, which I no longer need, and maintain psych care. All the best. Let me know if you need anything else. 🙂

What are some of the most effective ways to fight depression?
I would say try TMS therapy (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation therapy). I’ve had a similar experience and after a while it was the only thing that helped. I believe it helps for most and is recommended with folks who have treatment-resistant depression where many medications haven’t helped. If it helps, you can do maintenance treatments every so often. Just try to get medical insurance that covers it, and then look into a provider that provides the service (do a search online). It can be a life changer. Good luck!!

What is something that we cannot control in our lives? Why can't we change it or stop it from happening?
Other then our reactions to everything that happens around us. I don't think there is anything we can control.
Life to me is all about choosing what to give a damn about. And you only get a few chances to do it. So use them wisely and you will be considerably happier.

What are the jobs for a diploma holder in Pakistan?
Any Job you want my friend. Having a diploma is a proof, that you studied a significant amount of years and passed a test.
You can start in the same field and start interviewing in different firms and junior or mid level positions. Go for the most money for now and learn as much as possible along the way.
Don't let a diploma narrow your options. It was a challenge you crossed it.. Now there are endless possibilities ahead. Get moving. God Bless!

What is the most clever life hack you've learned?
It was a tiktok video I once saw on REDDIT and it's by far the best thing of 2021.
So it's a hack about not crying in public when someone is yelling at you! So how to not cry!
First you need to know a bit of background about what happens when a person yells. When you yell your butt hole just squeezes in and out. The harder you yell the harder it squeezes…
So next time you're in a situation like this. Just think about the above fact… It’s hard to cry or take them seriously when you're imagining how there butt hole would be reacting!
I don't have the video yet but if I saw it again I'll edit the answer!

Rejection on any level is a powerful blow of reality to our own self image and can be considered as a wake up call. Sometimes, it's inevitable in life to get rejected but also no matter how bad it is you have to move on from it. So the only thing you can do is to make that process faster.
Start by assessing the situation and knowing where you stand on that particular situation, the sooner you know your position the faster you will be able to move on. Instead of reacting just take a breath and step back and try to control yourself in these situations. It's amazing how much you can do in changing your life.

Is it dangerous in Pakistan?
It all goes down to what your expectations are of the place well thanks to the news channels most visiters end being really happy. But I think it comes down to your encounters with the local public and along with that under which circumstances you meet them. So people are welcoming and positive here and its really a change of environment, and your visit will be memorable here thats for certain and you will not look at the news at the same way.

Why is it so important to have blasphemy laws? Is this not lack of freedom of speech?
Well in one sentence I can put it this way “Today you are faking it. Tomorrow you be making it.” A law of any kind acts as a guideline to what is accepted in the socaity. Helps you become a normal and respected citizen. As far as the blasphemy laws goes I think not just about Islam, it should be the same about all the religions existing in Pakistan. You disrespect the core values of the religion the get ready for the outcome. It is importent because if they are not followed its really easy to minipulate public. and you know what happens afterwords. Pretty simple it all starts with words. Not everyone take words lightly. Freedom of speach doesn’t mean you start calling out and start giving your opinion on everything just because you know how to google stuff. So first understand the topic and…

Why does it take 4 TVA agents to apprehend a variant? Why can't it be more than that?
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) is a bureaucratic organization responsible for monitoring and maintaining the timeline of the multiverse. The specific number of TVA agents needed to apprehend a variant can vary depending on the circumstances and the threat posed by the variant. The portrayal of TVA agents apprehending variants with a team of four is a creative choice made by the writers and filmmakers for storytelling purposes. Here are a few reasons why it might be depicted this way: 1. Efficiency and Protocol: The TVA has specific protocols and procedures for dealing with variants to minimize disruption to the timeline. A team of four agents might be deemed the optimal number to effectively capture and neutralize a variant without causing excessive disturb…

Who would win, Bully Maguire or Will Smith?
The question of who would win in a battle between Bully Maguire and Will Smith is a humorous and playful hypothetical scenario that has emerged from internet memes and fan creativity. Let's break down the characters involved: 1. Bully Maguire: This refers to a meme that originated from scenes in the ""Spider-Man 3"" movie where Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) briefly becomes more aggressive and displays bully-like behavior after being influenced by the symbiote suit. The meme has evolved into a humorous portrayal of an exaggeratedly aggressive version of Peter Parker. 2. Will Smith: Will Smith is a real-life actor known for his roles in various films and TV shows. While he is not a fictional character in the same sense as Bully Maguire, the idea of pitting him against a meme character is part…

Why do people think that the Saint Seiya universe can solo all fiction?
The idea that the Saint Seiya universe can ""solo all fiction"" is likely an exaggeration or hyperbole that has arisen from passionate fans of the series. ""Saint Seiya"" is a popular Japanese manga and anime franchise created by Masami Kurumada. It features a group of mystical warriors known as the ""Saints,"" who are granted superhuman abilities and wear magical armor known as ""Cloths"" to protect the Earth from various mythological threats. Fans of any given fictional universe can sometimes become enthusiastic and exaggerate the capabilities of characters and worlds within that universe. This can lead to statements like ""solo all fiction,"" which essentially means that the characters from that universe are perceived to be so powerful that they could defeat any other fictional characters or unive…

Who would win, 30 billion Spongebobs or the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe?
Pitting 30 billion SpongeBobs against the entire Neon Genesis Evangelion universe is quite an imaginative scenario, but it's important to consider the vast differences in scale, power, and themes between the two. SpongeBob SquarePants is a beloved cartoon character from a lighthearted and comedic animated series. While SpongeBob has demonstrated resilience and creativity in various situations, he is still a cartoon character with relatively limited capabilities and abilities. Neon Genesis Evangelion, on the other hand, is a mecha anime series that delves into complex themes of psychological trauma, existentialism, and the human condition. The series features massive biomechanical mechs (Evas) piloted by young teenagers to combat existential threats known as Angels. The Evas are equipped with…

In Ant-Man & the Wasp, why do Hank, Hope, and Janet disintegrate simultaneously unlike Infinity War, where the characters disintegrate one by one?
In ""Ant-Man & The Wasp,"" the disintegration of Hank Pym, Hope van Dyne, and Janet van Dyne is not directly related to the events of ""Avengers: Infinity War."" The simultaneous disintegration of characters in ""Infinity War"" is a result of the snap caused by Thanos using the Infinity Gauntlet, which wiped out half of all life in the universe. In ""Ant-Man & The Wasp,"" the characters disintegrate due to the effects of the Snap, but the timeline is different. The movie takes place concurrently with the events of ""Infinity War"" but focuses on its own story and characters. During the movie's mid-credits scene, while Scott Lang (Ant-Man) is in the Quantum Realm, Hank Pym, Hope van Dyne, and Janet van Dyne disintegrate as a result of Thanos' Snap, which occurred in ""Infinity War.""

Who would win in a fight between Jack Sparrow and Queen Mera?
A battle between Jack Sparrow and Queen Mera would be an intriguing clash of personalities and abilities, but it's important to remember that they come from very different fictional universes with distinct powers and contexts. Jack Sparrow is a witty and cunning pirate from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film series. While he's known for his resourcefulness and luck, he's primarily a human character without any superhuman abilities. His strengths lie in his quick thinking, improvisation, and ability to manipulate situations to his advantage. He often relies on his charm and strategic maneuvering to navigate dangerous situations. Queen Mera, on the other hand, is a character from the DC Comics universe, specifically associated with Aquaman. She is an Atlantean with hydrokinetic powers, allowi…

Can Goku solo the Kengan Ashura universe?
Based only on the power levels and abilities we have seen from Goku in the Dragon Ball franchise, it is very possible that he could defeat most, if not all, of the characters in the Kengan Ashura universe.
Given Goku's immense power, speed, and fighting skills, he stands a very good chance of defeating any character who tries to challenge him. However, the characters in the Kengan Ashura universe have their own unique abilities, techniques, and fighting styles that could potentially make things challenging for Goku.
Ultimately, it depends on how the scenario is written and how the two universes are brought together. But in general, Goku's immense power and fighting abilities would likely give him an advantage against most opponents in the Kengan Ashura universe.

i have to say this: i just recently turned 22, and already feel so lost in life. I've been struggling with depression for the last 5 years, and anxiety my whole life but only now I got the strength to ask for help. It's hard, really hard, sometimes I just want to give up everything because it hurts too much.
and you comment just made my heart warmer and couldn't help but smile. I have a long road ahead but today is gonna be a good day. thank you for your kind words.
love, anna

Is the enchantress in the Beauty and the Beast film evil, since she cursed the beast when he was only 12 years old?
I’d say she’s morally questionable, instead of evil. I didn’t watch the 1991 version, but in the 2017 ver., the prince was punished mostly because he didn’t accepted the rose (presumably because it’s worthless to him) and not letting the enchantress stay for the storm (which is definitely unkind, but hardly deserve such punishment consider his position and the time period. Actually with how she barged into the party, I’m surprised the prince didn’t put her in prison for further investigation because she might as well be an assassin or any manner of suspicious characters. The only other crime we know in the movie is of heavy tax aka greed, which in my opinion much more deserving of punishment, but clearly that wasn’t her intent (he can love a woman and still be greedy too). Imho, the whole…

If a tall, hunky guy was hitting on you in a bar and another woman told you he'd raped her, would you pay any attention?
Yes. Regardless of the guy’s looks, an accusation of rape is a red flag for any more interactions with that guy. He might as well be super hot and charismatic, but I draw the line whether the accusation is true (which is more likely) or not. Look this way: if I believe her, I lose nothing. If I don’t, and she was right, I might become the next victim. That’s a risk I’m not willing to take, especially with little to gain.

Should a woman (me) start having sex with random men to pay my rent or go homeless?
For me, if there truly is no other way (i.e no job available, no other possible source of income etc), then yes, prostitution is better than being homeless. The reason it is my last resort is due to health concerns, and possible social consequences later (I live in a rather conservative country). But when one’s going to be homeless, it’s not like social reputation really matters that much anyway. Do what you choose to do, and do your best to be safe. I wish you the best.

I’m not here to oppose you. I just want to ask you a question: Why is it important for nature to take its course?
I’ve read your arguments. While I do not agree with you, I respect your opinions. I’m just curious on your insistence that nature must run its course, or that it’s better if nature does take its course. May I ask why is that? We as human do a great many things to better our lives and protect ourselves from unwanted nature’s influence. Examples are medicines, clothes, anything mechanical such as transportation, air conditioner, etc. Why should we go against nature every time it’s inconvenient/harmful for us, but for this matter, it’s important that we follow the nature’s course? Also, if we do follow nature’s course, shouldn’t young boys and girls start having sex without protection since they hit puberty? Can you imagine the mess it would be, especially when marriage is a human-made concept, and wouldn’t be absolutely necessary then?
Again, I do not in anyway claim any of our opinions is absolutely right. I just wonder where this deep seated belief of you come from, and how does it apply in other matters in life, when it doesn’t involve pregnancy and abortion.

Can I consider a past friend shallow if he thinks he can just catch up with me after 5 years of no contact?
Some of my friends used to have the same problem with me. “Kiva, we haven't talked for week/month/year. What kind of friendship is this?” The problem is, we have very different modes of communication. I can not talking with someone for a year, then catch up with them like nothing happened. They required weekly/monthly contact to keep the relationship going. We weren't compatible. i'm a natural airheaded and distant person, it's tiresome for me to remember if i spoke to ~20 ppl each week, and i think they're just too clingy. i am more than willing to offer a helping hand when they're in need, but in everyday life, i don't see why they need to be in constant communication. On the contrary, i know they feel i don't care/too cold and that they have to do everything in the relationship. it's jus…

Well, yeah… if you want to get all the benefits (aka southern hospitality etc), you need to be white or at least from Europe (white European would be ideal, but from Europe is still better in their eyes than Asian), straight/cis, preferably Christian.
There are other more open to foreigners states, if you can move there it would be easier.

Why can't I do my best at something even though I supposedly want it? What is wrong?
“Supposedly” is your keyword. If you want it then you want it. If you “supposedly” want it, then you think you should want it, but you don’t.
Wanting something might not be the reason you work hard to get it. I want a great deal many things, and to be honest, I haven’t been actively pursuing most of them for a long time. The main reason is I don’t want them enough that I’d do anything for them. Few people actually achieve this level of “want”. It’s discipline rather than “wanting” or motivation that gets you what you work hard for.

Is it normal for Asian grad students to be ignored by their White American peers in the USA?
That depends on where you live in U.S.
I live in Baltimore, MD for about 4 years, and there were some issues with races, but I’d never got this kind of problem. Most people, all races included, tended to say “hi” back or greet first when we saw each other, normally with a big smile no matter if they actually like me or not. I’m a young woman of average looks, but overall I didn’t encounter that kind of reaction. My school has both undergrad and grad, so I’m quite sure it’s not the norm in some grad schools, but maybe the state where you live. Some states are less open to other races than others.

You would absolutely hate me if I sit in front of you.
Let me explain.
Most of my flights are 24–30 hrs including transits. On 8-hrs and 14-hrs flights, I reclined the moment the seat-belt sign was off. Why? Because I was ready to sleep, regardless of whether the plane’s turned off the light or not. I don’t see why it’s a breach of etiquette when I was awake from 3am to go to airport for a 7am flight, got off the plane around 10am, went through security, wait for 4–6 hrs transit (not sleeping of course), then finally got on a 14-hrs flight. By that point, I’d be exhausted and couldn’t wait to sleep or just simply rest my tired body on a reclined seat. Yes it’s just a few degree, but after such a day, it gives me immense pleasure. If you poke and tell me that it’s drink & meal services time, and thus stop me from my sweet sleep, I’d give you a “wtf” eye and go back to sleep. Why? Because I’d be ******* tired and can’t see why a tiny cup of water (my cup) is valuable enough to keep me awake for like, 20–40 mins since take off. Note: I never had any problem drinking/putting my cup on the table while the passenger in front of me reclined, and I don’t recline when food’s served.
I observed the same reaction from at least 60% passengers on long flights (i.e falls asleep a few minutes after take off). Beside meal times, I can’t see how one can determine any specific time when other passengers should absolutely not reclined. Nobody knows how many hours the other passengers had flew before that very flight, what their body conditions are, their biological clocks (different timezone, so maybe the take off is right on their midnight?), or if they have other reasons (meeting when the plane lands so they need to catch their sleep etc). I think assuming people’s behaviors according to a flight duration (a few hours in, short flight etc) is not logical because there’s too many variants.

Is it inappropriate for me to pull a woman close and spontaneously kiss her while she's in the middle of talking to me?
Swap the gender. That’s one of the tests I use to determine if certain social interaction is appropriate. Do you feel appropriate if you pull a man close/kiss him while he’s talking with you? If the relationship is close enough (he’s your bf/spouse/fwb etc) then it’s also appropriate to do the same to a woman. If he’s gonna punch you in the gut or simply confused out of his mind, it isn’t, same goes for a woman.

My only enjoyment in life is eating (also binge-eating) and weight loss. I am obsessed - how can I escape this cycle?
Ive felt EXACTLY the same way. However, after years of dealing with eating disorders I've learned that there are more import st thinks in life other than food. I know food is delicious, but it's just a part of life it should not be what you live for. Find what you love, find a passion and engage in it. Try eating healthy, and you'll feel much better. I know that it's hard to stop binging but it's possible. I strayed with small steps, (having smaller binges each time). Also if you don't stop dieting, it's more difficult to stop binging since your body needs fuel. Try engaging on a healthier balanced diet instead. Sending love

Why is life so boring?
Honestly, I think life can be pretty boraring or pretty dam cool, depending on how you choose to live it. In order to be happy you need to do what you love, have good relationships, and enjoy yourself onece in a while. This includes working in sometime you are really passionate, going out with your fiends, meeting new people, traveling, and occasionally letting yourself engage in pleasurable activities like eating a big slice of your favorite dessert or having some bomb ass sex! You choose, you can stay all day long working in some boring stuff or you can decide to live life and stop worrying!

Whenever you feel you have the most energy, which will probably be from 6:00–800 pm since testosterone levels are higher at this time causing you to feel more energized. But morning walks have benefits as well since they prepare you for tha day and put you in a good mood.

What is a good workout routine to increase my leg strength in order to increase my vertical?
Running! Running works and strengthens all your leg muscles. If you are new to running try running for 20 or 30 minutes, with walking intervals, don't try to run till you are really tired and your legs are sore on your first since this will overwork your muscles, and will cause your muscles to ache for a long time. Slowly start running more and walking less, and in about 2 weeks you'll be able to run for 30 min nonstop, Then you can gradually increase mileage. Try eating a healthy snack when you have finished, something with carbs and protein like (yogurt with fruit).

I’m going to take a look at some Yamaha models. There are many music stores in my city (Ankara) and there is a Yamaha distributor, too; so it’s better to try a variety of models in the store. Unfortunately, when buying guitars from abroad, prices rise too much due to customs tax. You’ve already helped me a lot. Thank you again.

Can ADHD be treated with modafinil?
Yes, it is prescribed off label for ADHD. Modafinil is a stimulant medication, but it’s effects are much more mild than that of Adderall. One of the side effects is insomnia in 20 percent of patients. One of the psychiatrists I saw wanted me to take Wellbutrin, which is also prescribed off label for ADHD. Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with stimulant properties. He thought a stimulant would aggravate my bipolar 2. I tried it and could not sleep on it. Even when taking Seroquel at night to sleep! Modafinil might help you or not. You can always try it and see. Everyone has different brain chemistries, so it just depends on yours.

Is modafinil really useful?
A friend of mine, a neurologist, recommended I try Modafinil. He gave me one to try, which I did the next day at work - all 200 mg. The focus I felt was amazing I was able to read through code and tedious data diagrams not only with ease but with great interest. It seemed all so riveting all of the sudden. At meetings, I had the answers to questions in nanoseconds. I could sit done at my desk, crank out code, documentation, PowerPoint presentations, and 15 emails without stopping for anything - and I enjoyed it! But after a few days, I noticed I was getting irrationally angry at people for things that should have otherwise been no big deal. I was irritated that people didn’t finish their sentences fast enough (we both knew where they were going with their point, right?) - so I was frequently interrupting people. The thing is, while I was doing it, I was aware that I was being a rude asshole, but I found it too hard to stop myself. If I thought someone had slighted me, my heart would be racing in anger. Without Modafinil, I’d be concerned, but good countermeasures would come to mind if I sat and thought about it for a little while. Instead, I chewed people out when I should have taken a step back. In short, Modafinil made me very good at absorbing new information and cranking out technical tasks with ease, but it hampered my ability to take the time broadly reflect strategically on a situation. In other words, you’d want to give this to fighter pilots, but not so much to high ranking diplomats. I love Modafinil, but I found that I can’t tolerate anywhere near 200 mg. I can max out at 100 but mostly take 50 mg and only when I know I’ll be by myself to work on a take where I need to concentrate. My friend who gave me Modafinil in the beginning .. he takes 200 mg a day and he’s cool as a cucumber. So I guess it may be different depending on the person.

You are honestly at a cross roads. Above all things, take your time and be sure of what you want before you make any decisions.
If you chose to try again with your wife, it will be different. You will never again have what you once had with her. If it is remade, there will always be that tainted place where you hurt. Because of betrayal, people often end up plagued if their spouse is really happy with them…(ie: do they like me, do they desire me, am I inadequate, do they love me, are they sorry, will they do it again, are they doing it again now, will they find someone else if I fail in some way, what if I disappoint?). I personally, do not find that to be good for anyone.
You don’t sleep anymore. Why? Are you up all night thinking? If so, what are you thinking about? Are you wondering what you should do? Are you up all night wrestling with your emotions? I tend to be unable to sleep when I am in a ‘’what do I do” situation. I have learned to take a step back and breathe. Is your wife losing sleep? I am not currently in a situation like yours but it isn’t an unfamiliar situation to me. I have been in a place where my spouse would fall asleep so quickly but I couldn’t. That would bother me. I have learned that it is foolish and self destructive to care more about a relationship than the person that destroyed it when I did my part to the best of my ability. Its okay to care. Just try (and only try as it is not easy) to not care more. Keep it balanced. You are losing weight? WHY?!
Patrick, I already like you. Why? Because you are asking questions and seeking answers. That is one of the greatest traits a person can have. You also clearly have a tender heart full of love and selflessness. I can be blunt and I hope to not offend you. That said… please understand what is going on with you. It is one of those things that one can rarely see when IN a situation but it is so clear from the outside. You have loved, honored, and cherished. You have been deceived, lied to, betrayed, and deeply wounded by the only person ON EARTH that VOWED to always love, honor, and cherish you. Then, you forgave, pardoned, and gave her another chance. She made deliberate choices that completely declared that she was not sincere or worthy of the second chance that you gave her. Then you stood up for yourself and said that you cannot allow yourself to be treated so poorly. That was GREAT! Now, whatever she was pursuing has lost her interest or she needs you. Perhaps, she misses you, wants you, and really wants another chance. Fair enough. Something is amiss though. How is she holding up? Does she seem miserable to the point that her life is slipping away or does she seem upset as a druggie not getting their drug? There is a different behavior when someone is depressed and HUMBLE as opposed to when someone is in need and demanding fulfillment of something they are seeking.
I believe that most people that messed up and hurt their spouse would feel very guilty if they were truly remorseful. If you were the offender, would you handle this differently than she is handling things? I would really take a look at the humility that she is displaying and question that.
You are clearly a very caring and empathetic person. You are stressing to the point that you are falling apart. Did you know that it is NOT selfish to prioritize yourself? It is selfish to not consider others. It is selfish to only care about your profit or pleasure (according to the dictionary). That said, you are responsible for you. If you do not prioritize your well being and health, no one else will.
Patrick, ask yourself what you want. Do you really want to re-enter into a relationship with your wife? Are you just extremely committed and empathetic and want to save her from being sad? Are you worried about the time period where you wouldn’t have someone around to love you? Will reconciling be worse than it is now? You two aren’t even ‘’together’’ at this point and you say you are arguing all of the time. Is that how someone that is very remorseful behaves? PATRICK, you deserve to be treated well! You deserve to have someone fight for you. You deserve to be loved and cherished.
Right now, you are responsible for yourself. This is the time of your life where you need to care about you. You cannot be more lonely than you are right now. Embrace the quiet and the solitude. You still have work, friends, and your children. Figure out what makes you happy. I think you will grow exponentially if you focus on you and nothing else. Join a gym, eat healthy, learn some new things, get a small hobby, get out a little and try a new takeout place or take a class.
Learn to be happy. Happiness is an attitude. Learn to chose to embrace life as it is. (There is a profound quota post on this and I will link it when I find it. It impacted me greatly.) Do not get me wrong, this situation still sucks and it still hurts. In that, you can focus on other things and take advantage of thinking and growing time.
As you do well for yourself and essentially learn how to love yourself and be happy, you will be able to set and enforce a standard by which other people should treat you.
While it isn’t completely uncommon, it is unacceptable to control your spouse. Your wife is out of bounds to tell you that you cannot have female friends. Does she not trust you? NO, she is projecting her tendency to be unfaithful onto you. If you have to jump through hoops to get back with her, she is playing you. She should be willing to move mountains. Do not be afraid for her to lose interest or give up on you. If she does, her heart towards you was not genuine to begin with. These situations bring out the truth.
So, if you focus on you and do well, perhaps, it will throw your wife off guard. She will either get it together, let you be you and make things work or she will lose interest. As you put yourself first, your feelings may change. You may want better. Either way, you will be more prepared to hold her treatment towards you to a high standard. These situations cause the truth of the matter to surface. So it would be good to date her …occasionally and casually. You need to be the one in control. You decide if you want this. You write the terms and do not let her give you conditions or ultimatums. You be yourself unapologetically and let her worry if need be. Let her try. Do not argue. In this type of situation, you cannot let her think that she has any power or control over you.
I would still be kind and polite. I hope that this finds you well and makes sense. I have to grab the kids from school so I am sending this without proof reading.
Just think about what makes you happy. It doesn’t even have to be a person. it can be a feeling. If you knew for sure that there was another woman that valued you that you would share so much happiness with within months of divorce, would this decision be any easier? Sometimes, we are just afraid of being alone. I think when you really put yourself and your well being first, you will find someone that brings you a happiness that you have never imagined possible.

Forgiveness is a change of attitude or letting go of negative emotions. Forgiveness is not the same as excusing or pardoning. I was once told that if you loan your truck to a friend and they wreck it, you can forgive them. Now, how many times are you going to hand them the keys if they make a habit of wrecking your truck? To forgive is to accept that people mess up and not be angry. Forgiveness is for you. Forgiveness keeps you from carrying around anger, bitterness, and a victim mentality. While forgiveness is an extremely healthy thing to do, it is incredibly unhealthy to continue to allow anyone to continue to hurt you. You can forgive and maintain boundaries. Never forfeit your self respect.
If you did what your wife did would you want her to take you back? I ask that because I wouldn’t want my husband to take me back if I did that because (granted I am slightly biased as a non-cheater) I love my spouse and wouldn’t want him to be with me if I valued him poorly enough to do that. I would feel unworthy of him. As good spouse, I would want him to have the love he deserves. If your children were in this situation, what would you want them to do? I think that sometimes, the answers are obvious and we don’t want to accept them because life isn’t going as we want it to go. The tug of war is that it is normal and natural to want your current wife but want her to be the way you thought she was before she hurt you. We want things to be the way they “should be”. Things not being the way we think they should be leads to some serious cases of depression so be cautious of how you are coping.
Do you believe that someone could love you as you once were loved? Do you believe that you can find a real happiness and joy without your current wife? You can create something new and exciting. Wouldn’t that be a great example for the kids? Would you want them to overlook being betrayed and stay with someone that has made it clear that they can easily disregard doing right by them? Children do emulate their parents. You can be resilient. You can really grow through this.
If you do want to give this marriage another attempt, I strongly encourage you to make her earn the relationship. If she isn’t willing to work for it, then it isn’t worth your efforts. Relations will skew judgement due to the chemical responses and if she is pushing that… she is likely doing that intentionally. I would keep relations on the back burner until you are sure that you can trust her again. If she can’t wait for you then will she be able to control other impulses and urges? Ability to wait can show that she can control herself enough to be faithful. I would also encourage you to spend little and invest little into dates. The goal is to offer her no ulterior incentives in dating you and to keep the focus on an actual relationship… walks, talking, and simple affordable meals (or picnics).

If a children’s party invitation stated a £50 minimum gift is required for entry but you couldn’t afford it, should you just take your child there anyway and hope for the best or tell the child you can’t afford it and they can’t go?
That is an extortionate request. They should be grateful for any gift not be demanding £50. I wouldn't take mine and I bet a lot won't ☹️

Well i think you handled this amazingly. Way better than I probably ever would. She used you and at a time you needed her support the most. She hurt you in an unreal way and that trust wont ever return. Not all women are like that but it takes time to be able to open up again. I have been there. You are strong and you can do it. You will find the girl of your dreams one day and your love will be 100x stronger. She probably had her ass dumped. That's zero excuse.

I am just now coming to terms that I have a narcissistic mother at 35 years old. As I analyze my childhood years it is hard to see the narc qualities in her as clearly as I can see them today. There are definite red flags but nothing as severe as recent years. How common is it to show few signs then within 30 years the narc qualities are crystal clear? Is NPD described as “progressive?”
excuse the typos please, dyslexic, adhd and. asd i think as you learn more about narcs and their behaviour and their warped behaviour and twisted sense of beleif of themselves and you, then you become more self aware. my mum was a victim most her life and not a narc. then as she became stronger, wiser and fiesty, she became the abuser and the narc without realising. usually narcs are created through traumatic experiences, as she got older she become to depend on being the victim, turning me and my siblings against each other, and it was a fun enjoyable game for her, because she had all the attention she needed. i belevie she got worse, but at same time to save my sanity, i learned as much as i could to make sure i wasnt being cruel or harsh with her. i never wanted to hurt her, but i just cou…

i totally agree, im so motivated internally when people say i cant aheive something and want to see me fail and be a victim. i hate victim mentality in myself, because my family are narcs , so im much more motivated through negativity as its more powerful than actual friends giving praise and support, becasue deep down, i dont know if i deserve that or they are trying to just be nice and kind .
I dont think it really matters, where the reslience or strength is triggered, as long as you know, its always there for you, deep inside, waiting for you to summon it. like a super power!

please excuse typos. im dyslexic, adhd and asd
my mum was a narc (she passed) and my ex is a covert narc and his fave game is to call me a narc. narcs dont ever question if they are a narc. if you are a narc, you dont ever question if you could improve or alter your behavuour as you beleive your own attitude to be perfect and everyone else is wrong. so the fact your hurt and questioning proves you are not a narc. narcs fave game is called the victims a narc. theres plenty of proof of this online and in books to expland on how or why. they need proof in their mind constantly that they are the victim and have tendenceis to beleive their own lies. my ex (the kdis father) has emailed me to say he has private therapy for nearly three years becuase the cant cope with the suffering and trauma i put him through? its laughable…he says i only let him out once a week, at that time, he never had any hobbies or interests or wanted to go out and as he was gaiining weight and seemingly becoming only interested in gaming, i kept sending him links to five a side football, ect, told him to go out. suggested places. when he didnt go out, i took advantage of the baby sitter (their dad) watching the kids while they slept and i went out. comedy clubs, zumba, badminton. but he always had a choice.
he beleives his own lies. so therapy wont work because he will at some point be aked to write down his feelings and his part of responsibility which resulted in our separation. he changed the locks when me and the kids took a short break to wales. Kids was 2 and 6 at the time, so young. He later bragged on eamil that he pulled the rug from underneath. when i asked how he can make his own children suffer and become homeless, he laughed and said, i didnt kick them out. I kicked you out. but i had the kids. so he cant see how they were affected and how he is to blame directly for that.
narcs are totally void of guilt, blame or responsibiility fo rtheir own actioos. waste of time and energy. i give him bare min responses now. and hes blocked from speakinig and we hand the kids over on alterantive weekedns and its civil. he will always be a narc, im tired of trying to get him see the truth, any other truth other than his own warped, twisted version .

What are the differences between being raised by your biological father and being raised by your stepfather (if you've had both)?
none, love is love. if you have both who love you, consider yourself very lucky. please excuse the typos, i have dyslexic traits and type to fast. My biological dad wanted nothing to do with me or my brother and never paid a penny towards child maintenance, and acitively avoided being chased for 16 yrs for it. My two step dads were both abusive physcially towards my mum who had anorexia at one point and passed recently due to alcohol addiction to cope with the suffering. I was around 17 when I first inteferred with my step dad who i was forced to call Dad at the time, i kicked him in the shins as a warning to leave my my alone. so he threw me over a wall and cracked my rib. my mum was under his spell and his nasty ways, so next day i got a bollocking off her for hurting my ‘dads’ shins, and to…

What are some possible reasons why children throw fits and have temper tantrums at times that seem completely inappropriate (not hungry, tired, etc.)?
they are always appropiate for the child in that moment of time. In that exaxt moment of time, you may miss the trigger, could be noises, could be a sad thought, could be and likely lots of upsetting emotion they supress all during the day, and they you may be their safe place and so they let themself go and have a meltdown with you. Im adhd and asd and my young kids are very likely both and one seems to be PDA, which means i have to be extra vigilent and aware of trigger beyond the usual tired and hungry, cause its very rarely that. im not saying you are wrong or bad for not noticing but assuming you come on hear seekiing possible ideas and helpful suggestions? presume this is upsetting or affecting you? so my only advice, is to if possible and appropiate hold the child if they allow you t…

they may take for pain releif, my friend has firbomarlja (cant spell it and too lazy to google) and one of them has a stomach stoma and survived leukemia and is still in daily chronic pain.
I also have a friend who smokes it from first thing in the morning, its called polly rather than traditional weed (dont know the real difference but smells less) and she takes for her own anxiety and depression,
I dont smoke at all, and mind my own god damn business. I dont care, its their chose and seems to help all of the above but apparantly can also create its own problems such as dependency (phsyscically and mentally) and in some cases, paranoia.
it doesnt concern you, they could be much more terrible things a neighbour can do and be, dogs barking is one of my personal triggers, and that drives me crazy, dont have a dog if your going to keep it outside and it will bark its bollocks off all day long, its upset and so am I.
if you got to know your neighbour, maybe they will share their reasons and you realise, its nothing to be concerned about.
if they were forever outside polishing a gun and firing all the time, getting drunk and abusive, hitting the wives then id have reason to question their intentions for example.

What is the name of the person who raised you but is not your biological father?
officially its prob stepfather, or stepdad, but i was raised by stepdad from being 8 yrs old and called him dad all my life, didnt know the definition of stepdad. Got some looks from teachers at primary school when they learned he was only ten yrs older than me. But him and my mum stuck it out for 30 odd years until she passed.
I also have three step brothers and one step sister, but i will never call them that, they are part of my family and so we dont need to use the word step. Its no body elses business if they have the same dad or not, we all have the same mum, so I find it irrelevant.
Hopefully this helps x

I have severe social anxiety and my parents are forcing me back to school, they said they’d get me therapy, but not until after I go back… I’m terrified and feel like Ill kms because of going back (and other factors) … what should I do?
Hello! I'm so sorry you're experiencing this right now! I've had experiences similar to yours and I know how daunting and insurmountable situations like this can feel (I'm not going to say that I know exactly how you're feeling though because everyone experience things differently and I don't want to make this about myself). My advice to you would be to communicate how you're feeling with an adult (it sounds like you're a teenager?). Your parents need to understand that your need for help is urgent. You could ask them to set aside some time for you to talk to them about something important or write them a letter if that's easier. If telling your parents doesn't feel safe, there's always options. If you're part of a religious organization you can ask a religious leader. Or you can go find one…

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
(Note: I do mention suicide and self harm) Hello. So my mom was the same way. Part of it had to do with her ableism and the fact that she's against pharmaceutical companies. I don't know your opinions on those things, and I'm not going to assume; I just figured it was relevant enough to mention. I always have had problems in school but in sixth grade, I started feeling anxious in certain situations and I couldn't understand why. It continued to worsen to the point where some of my high school teachers spoke to my mother about in on my behalf to see what could be done to help me because it was severely impacting my school performance and my quality of life. My fear was that she wouldn't believe me. I was right. I did wind up with an IEP. I was often gaslight for things I couldn't control. The…

What would you do if your 31 yr old daughters a nymphomaniac, a drunk pill head and has two different baby fathers want listen to reason and get help? We have offered to take her kids while she goes to rehab.
Unfortunately, she has to want the help. You can offer advice, words of wisdom, rides to meetings, but she still has to want it. You can offer to pay for the best rehab in the county, but she still has to want it. It's a really tough and disappointing reality to try to accept as a loved one. All you can do is be there for her when she is ready. I wish you and your family the best!

I will never say I know how you feel only you know that . However, I will say I went through something similar and I have survived just as you have. I'm so glad I am not in charge of judgment. I have to leave that to small people and the one that is truly in charge if judging. I'mso sorry you had to go through such a painful experience and then loose the ones you loved to judgement.

My son passed a couple of days before he turned 17. My daughter passed a couple years later a couple of days before the turned 21. I don't really remember anything anyone said that helped or hurt. But, since those 2 miserable days, I have had friends who have had to bury a child. The only thing I know to say to them is “I have no idea how you feel, I only know how I felt. But I can relate with the unnatural pain of losing part of yourself you loved the most.” I don't know if that is the right thing to say, but I always make myself available for if and when they need to talk or just to let them scream. And mainly let them know, if they feel as if they are losing their mind , that is okay to not be okay.
I'm truly sorry you had to feel that unnatural pain and you woke up in this club no one wants to join.
I also wanted you to know your daughter is beautiful and thanks for sharing her with us.

My grandmother got married at 78 years old. They lived together for one month and she told him he had ti to go back to his house. I asked her why th9s this happened. They were definitely in love. They went dancing all rhe the time and she got giddy just talking about him. So everyone was so confused when she rold told him to leave. This was her response….
Im to damn old to take care of a man so i told him to go home and take care of himself. He did, and they stayed married and traveled and danced til the end. This is just a good example of one type of a happy marriage. Lol

Can integration happen spontaneously after decades of therapy and recovery even though it was never the intention?I was diagnosed with poly fragmented DID 30 years ago.Gradually (after A LOT of work and decades of therapy) I have gotten to the point where I no longer lose time and there is a new sense of inherent wholeness and yet I don't feel like I've lost anything.

What is the best case of “You just picked a fight with the wrong person” that you've witnessed?
Wait, what I witnessed or what I've done, or what did someone with me get messed with and someone else took care of shit?

Why TF Do I Even Bother
I have a question about calling 911 in the first place. Why do they need our adress? It shows out location on their screen! Ugh!
Ok, now back to your question...
Idk if 911 does things cross the board, but I've called 911 for real emergency and then I called telling them that I think I smell a gas leak, then I've also dialed it by complete mistake by trying to fix my phone. I'm in California, and the calls that were emergency and they had to bring fire, ambulance, and cop cars,I was charged $22.00 for the call, and received a bill in the mail showing I owed something close to 5Gs, which that got written off bc I have ssdi insurance, but I did have to pay the $22.00. When I called about the gas leak, not only did the operator tell me that they were aware of that, and then hung up on me, my phone bill had an emergency medical/fire charge of $45.00. When I have as well as some of my friends buttdialed it, but there were charges on all of our phone bills, and sometimes they would show up with the berries and cherries and jump out with their guns drawn, that was the biggest bill of all, which was charged almost $25,000 and she was notified that she has to go to court due to the calling/writing a false police report. These have happened to us, and we live in the same city, no further than 3 miles apart, but the only difference being is what year. So, I'd be more on the cautious side.

No! Just No! Someone is always gunna get hurt! It causes so much trauma and self-esteem that some might not even realize. People might feel so unworthy of love, romance, or a real relationship filled with happiness!
I was with my 1st boyfriend for over 10 years, and he did cheat on me a lot! I started believing that I am not worth it to anyone. That relationship ended in the mid 90s, and I still have scars from it!

Well that depends on what one considers sex. Are you only talking about traditional sex, or oral sex, or kissing, or even touching? What one would consider sex doesn't mean the same to another!

I'm not 100% positive, but I believe that everyone who is in medical treatments have someone to be their sounding board, and check in with each other to make sure they're all good!
But like I said, I'm not 100% about this!

I'm a believer that if I'm with you, then I'm only with you! Unfortunately, that never gets reciprocated! Which then turns that into never having another relationship!

I'm curious about the same thing. I've been doing lines from the same batch all week, without this feeling. I don't do lines all day, and sleep fine at night. I agree with you about staying on top of hygiene. I make an effort to make sure I drink 1.25 liter of water, and if I do start to feel dehydrated and have cramping, then I add some electrolytes into my water. I agree about mouthwash, I use one for dry mouth, and I gargle with Bentodine to help reduce any canker sores or bites on my tongue and cheek. Whenever I am out, I bring with me these little finger wraps that are meant to clean your dog/cat teeth or wipe their eyes. They do have finger wraps for babies and adults to clean their teeth or clean wounds in their mouth, but the ones for use on animals are much cheaper, and they are exactly alike!

I think it all depends on how well someone does it. If someone can't eat pussy right to save their lives, but they “THINK"" that they're doing it like a champ, it becomes annoying. Unless, you want constructive criticism about it. I'll never understand how some people are so forthcoming about what is not good for them, especially when you're in compromising positions!

Oh yeah for sure! August Virgos, we'll at least as far as I know and I'm a Sep Virgo, are louder, and crass, but somehow they can't stand up for themselves! However, BOTH would go down in a blaze of glory for family and friends! I can say what they have over us is they have more luck I'm the relationship department. They don't meticulously go over and over and over again what's right, wrong, or indifferent, which is Sep Virgos'all!
I know that I'm biased about this, but September Virgos are superior! We are loud, but demure, fun, funny, and always the life of the party!
Best way to describe this as an analogy would be this… September Virgos ARE the blondes having fun, whereas Aug Virgos are bottle blonds!
Ask yourself this… When you think of Virgos, what month do you think of first… August or September?

I have, on a couple of horrible occasions! I kept on believing that NOW they'll change, or NOW he's telling the truth! And I was W.R.O.N.G so very wrong! I thought that they were the love of my life, but, yet again, I was wrong! I used to go bananas for a couple of days. I would cry, argue, beg, and either overeat or no eating at all for close to a week. But… This new one, which I'm not even in a “relationship” with them, even though it's been going on since July. I have yet to go a full minute without thinking of him. I can't function normally anymore! I'm either crying or throwing up, or having massive anxiety attacks, not sleeping, barely eating, and I haven't been social with friends or family bc I am obsessing over him! Yes, I know I said obsessing! I've spoken to multiple therapist, without any resolution. I've begged and pleaded over and over for him to stop treating me so horribly and cruel. I am so crazy over him that I've had several strokes and and a couple of heart attacks! I am losing my mind over this guy! Of course I won't listen to reason, nor can I get over this!
When him and I are physically together, I mean in the same place, I am stuck on stupid around him! I can't form complete thoughts, let alone sentences!
If anyone has ever been like this for an excessive amount of time over someone, please let me know how you dealt with it.

Yes… Yes it can! I'm bipolar and I've had times where I barely get out of bed. I'm talking the bare minimum! Ive had episodes where I only get out of bed to use the bathroom and to the kitchen to get some food. I didn't shower, brush my teeth, change my clothes, or anything else for that matter! I just sit and zone out on the TV, or play on my phone. It's Luke that for a lot of us! I have heard about some people who don't even get out of bed to use the bathroom, { and yea… You know what I'm talking about } … The same bed that they're in thar they're using their bed as a toilet/ bed/table to eat! The worst that ive heard was someone was so horribly depressed that their animals had died from no food or water.
It can get horrific and mind-boggling how some people are that depressed!

Being a samurai was as much of a social rank as it was a military one and when considering the average height of a Japanese man before 1868 was normally 5′2 due to older generations usually being shorter than their younger counterparts which would severely limit his reach. Usually, he wouldn’t possess instantaneous reflexes or total militant dedication as you might expect. Sure, he is a great warrior but keep in mind that he was also nobility. Then combine this with previous points of him being usually on horseback while using polearms, greatswords, bows, or blunt weapons. To address the points about African tribesman and dogs, something to keep in mind is that both of them hunt in packs to subdue an obviously larger animal with individual members having the likely possibility of getting crippled or dying in these hunts. If one of these were to solo a gorilla, that would be a rather shitty prospect for the hunter. As for the 180 pound leopard, something to consider is that they have been known to kill stronger prey such as fully grown eland bulls as seen in Wild Cats of the World by themselves as it is within their very nature to do so while humans are social animals that will hunt within a group as they’re rather weak creatures when compared to larger predators by themselves. When addressing the intelligence point, while gorillas are obviously less intelligent than humans, an adult silverback gorilla would most likely have experience utilizing his bite strength and arms to fend off predators or other males within his group so arguably, he would still have experience. Lastly, to move onto the point about bones, cutting through what would be rather rough skin as well as muscle fiber and sinew that has been compared to steel cable with what would amount to two sidearms with relatively brittle metal that most European smiths wouldn’t touch. Then again, this a hypothetical scenario in which either party could win so it’s up in the air for the most part.

The reason the gorilla would not be rendered into a pile of filets is due to their skin being comparable to dried leather, their muscle fiber to steel cable, and their bones being five times as dense as the bones of human which wouldn’t help a samurai with standard weapons made out of pig iron, a brittle metal that needed to be folded eight times to avoid it breaking after an initial swing. Then pair this off with the fact that the average gorilla can run at 35 mph while Usain Bolt has ran at nearly 28 mph at his top speed. Tl;DR Katanas are underpowered in d20, gorilla has samurai beat in everything but intelligence in a fight

What are the properties of clay soil?
Composition Clay is made up of minuscule particles that form a hard, concrete-like consistency when dry, and a sticky mixture when wet. Water Retention Because of the composition of clay soil, it holds together very well to form a compact mass. Water retention is quite high and can result in problems such as water-logging and root infections for plants. The roots of plants may also find it difficult to travel through the soil because of the rigid structure. Nutrient Retention Clay is composed of particles that have a negative charge on them. This enables the soil to attract and hold on to mineral nutrients that are positive in charge. Some of the nutrients such as magnesium, potassium and calcium are vital to the growth of healthy plants. Good nutrient retention is one of the positive qualities…

What is the difference between a monoecious and a bisexual plant?
Monoecious plants have male flowers and female flowers in separate structures on the same plant.
Bisexual: each flower of each individual has both male and female structures, i.e. it combines both sexes in one structure. Flowers of this kind are called perfect, having both stamens and carpels. Other terms used for this condition are androgynous, hermaphroditic, monoclinous and synoecious.

What type of soil does a tropical evergreen forest have?
In the tropical rainforest, however, rainfall is year round, and can be daily. This strips out most of the nutrients. Many of these soils are Oxisols and Ultisols. In an oxisol, even the clays have been leached out of the soil, and replaced with aluminum oxides.

Which soil is good for growing rice?
Rice grows on most soil types ranging from sandy to loam to heavy clays and
from shallow to deep soils provided that adequate moisture levels are maintained in the
soil by rain or irrigation. The optimum pH range for rice is from 5.5-7.0 (acidic to
neutral) even though the crop can be successfully grown on soils with values rising as
high as 6-9 or falling as low as 5-4. The crop shows a degree of tolerance to salinity.

What is the street value of 50 mg of Xanax?
it depends on what size milligram xanex you have.
2mg Xanax bars we're $5 for the longest time but now there are so many pressed pills (fakes lookalikes) that the real ones can often pull in $9.
if you have the footballs which are one milligram and not so easily pressed and faked usually run 2 to $3 a piece.
If you are in a small community not close to a Big Town then you can demand more per milligram if you are in a major city expect to get no more than five or six bucks a bar (2 mg)
hope this helps

This is a great uplifting read. Its common to deal with a lot of negative comments when you’re younger going through that “awkward” phase many people go through. Even today as an adult I still deal with shitty comments from ignorant people in public. Although it can get pretty bad if poor self-maintenance contributes to that. Ive experienced that first hand. And Looking through your older photos you aren't really ugly at all, more like every normal person I see walking on the street every day. But being on both sides of the coin gives you a sense of appreciation and humility about peoples appearances. You tend to think twice about saying something about someone because you don't really know whats going on in their life. But another thing I learned is that money also helps lol.

No, its not your fault at all and I'm sorry if I came off that way! I was excited to be able to relate to you (even though we have very different stories) so I could tell you that there is hope and that you aren't alone:)

Hi Dalila,
I'm so sorry that you are going through all this. The whole situation sounds like a nightmare and I'm sure it feels like nothing in your world will ever be safe or right again. I currently have PTSD from an assault a few years ago and reading what you wrote sounded almost identical to thoughts that were going through my head after it happened so I wanted to share a few thoughts with you.
First of all, you are are totally justified in being terrified. People always told me “It's okay, it's over now” or “you need to move on.” and other little things that are well meaning but make you feel like you are crazy or over reacting. Just know that a lot of people dont understand and will never fully understand because they haven't been through what you went through and that's ok. I had the hardest time trusting anyone, being alone with people, or just being alone in general because I was pretty paranoid about it happening again. It is very scary, but very necessary to let people back into your life and thoughts. The more you let good people into your life the more you begin to see how many wonderful people are in the world and how miserable and alone the bad people are.
Also, things will get better. I know EVERYONE says this, but it's true. There is a part of you that is broken and what happened to you can never be made right, but your life is still valuable and beautiful. Its soooo hard to see a future when you can barely get up the courage to walk around dark corners or when your anxiety attacks are so bad that all you can do is sit on the floor and try to keep breathing. It's hard to look forward to life when you never know what moment or situation will send your mind back to the past and make you relive a situation. It's just hard to keep living when there isnt an end to the hardship in sight, but it does get better! I can promise you that life is so wonderful and beautiful that it's worth pushing though the dark things. 3 years ago I tried to kill myself and I am SO incredibly thankful that it didnt work!!!! I still have panic attacks and flashbacks and they suck, but I love being alive more than I hate the hard stuff.
Sorry I rambled, but here is a more organized list of things that helped me.
Music and podcasts. Get rid of the depressing songs and listen to something positive. Podcasts are great cause you can learn and be entertained while your mind is busy thinking on things that arent dark and hopeless.
Instead of laying on your bed or just sitting and zoning out, force yourself to get off your ass and do something. For me it was drawing and playing piano. I picked up a keyboard for $10 at a yard sale and made myself learn it. I am genuinely bad at all things artistic, but they require focus and will help your mind stay busy.
Write down 10 beautiful things and 5 things you are thankful for EVERY DAY with no excuses. They dont have to be flowers and rainbows, but it forces you to see the good in the world. It can be simple like how a dog is so happy to see its owner or the the grin your friend gives you when your teacher brushes the edge of an inside joke you share.
Talk to people!! Not all people give good advice, but the majority of people care and want good things for you. Try to talk to a therapist regularly!
Let yourself be loved. You have parents who love you and a good friend. Let them be close to you and let them help and love you. You are worthy of being loved and cared for just like everyone else.
This is really long, so sorry about that. You literally wrote my thoughts from 3 years ago and I wanted to tell what I wish someone had told me! Feel free to message me and rant.

The only thing stopping me from suicide is the thought of what it would do to my son. Sometimes it feels like that’s not enough. I’m getting tired- how bad would it be for him?
Hi there. I just turned 18 and a little over 14 years ago my mom killed herself. I'm going to tell you a few things that I've never told anyone because I really hope they'll help persuade you to stay with your son. These will probably come across as harsh because they were and still are harsh realities that I live with. I'm so sorry you feel this way, but please dont leave him. 1. I hardly remember her and it sucks. I remember a woman laughing, someone holding my hand in the store, and I remember her hair would get in my mouth when she tucked me in at night, but other than that I dont remember her and I still hate myself for forgetting. 2. I wonder multiple times a week if it was my fault. Was I too loud? Did i break things? Did i cause her and dad to fight? Did I get on her nerves? Did I disobey…

Hi there! First of all, I'm probably just a 2 or 3 years older than you, so I'm not an older person trying to tell you that you are perfect in every way just because it's what they think you need to hear. Also, I'm not trying to be creepy or hit on you, but I just wanted to say that you are stunning! You look like you could be a ballet dancer. I would ignore people because you look perfectly healthy.
About this boy… he sounds like a real jerk. If I was your brother, he would be on my hit list. He sounds like hes pretty verbally abusive and likes to play with your feelings and that's not okay. It sounds like you already know hes not a good person to be hanging around. People cant help but be influenced by the people they spend their time with, so hanging around this guy is going to be damaging to you. You are beautiful and worthy of someone who values you and is excited to be with you in public and in private. It really hurts to have a dad that you feel you can turn to, but dont take that out on yourself. He is a person struggling with his own issues that aren't at all your fault. He is responsible for himself.
The description of your dad reminds me of my dad a little bit, so you need to talk or rant to someone, let me know.

I was raised by a single dad for most of my early childhood, but he died in a farming accident when I was 9 and I was sent to a group home. Honestly, I have many fond memories of being there and none of this is my foster parents fault (they were awesome:). The first time anything relating to sex even crossed my mind was when I was 10. A man who had come to fix something with the electric was working upstairs and I had to go get my socks and backpack for school so I ran upstairs and the man called me over and said I was the most beautiful boy he had ever seen. I told him thanks and started for the stairs, but he told me to come over and check out what he found in the wall. I was 10 and fascinated by the idea of buried treasure, so I walked over and he grabbed me and told me he would kill me with him his screw driver if I made any noise, so i didn't. He closed the door to the room he was we were in and pushed my face into the bed while he pulled down my pants. I remember feeling something wet and then he started raping me. He kept saying I was so beautiful, but at that point I couldnt help but scream into the bed because it felt like I was being torn open. It didn't last very long cause he didnt want to get cought with all the screaming I was doing, so he let me go after I promised to keep quiet.

I'm a guy who is dating a guy, but for some reason I keep thinking about God. I guess I'm wondering who God is and why he is worth following? What do you want to tell a gay kid about God? I'm purely curious and won't be offended.
Wow, thank you all so much for taking all that time to give real answers!! I had no idea what the reasoning was behind “you are going to hell for your sins”. The last time I asked someone about God I got punched in the face and I nearly wrote off all religious activity as something I would never think about again. I have recently been doing a lot of processing my past. A few years ago I was in a situation where statistically I should have died, but I didnt and my initial though was that someone had a plan for my life. I dont know where that came from but it was enough to make me curious. My dad was very Jewish, but he passed away when I was little. He used to say almost daily that God had big plans for my life.

I'm a guy who is dating a guy, but for some reason I keep thinking about God. I guess I'm wondering who God is and why he is worth following? What do you want to tell a gay kid about God? I'm purely curious and won't be offended.

How do you know if your 10-year-old is gay?
You don't. That's not something for you to figure out, it's something for him to tell you when he's ready. There's no way to really know at that age. He may even say that he likes or wants to marry a boy, but he may end up liking boys and girls. You dont really know until you hear it from the source. Just support him and love him and he will tell you eventually.

Can a young 21 year old guy have sex with a 35 year old woman?
In most places, not legally. In general it's a really bad idea and not safe. You shouldn't have sex with someone who doesn't care about your well being and a 34 year old wouldnt want to have sex with a 16 year old if they genuinely cared for them. Again, it's also illegal in many places so I would wait 2 years and reevaluate your feelings then.

Should I allow my 13 year old to lock their bedroom?
I wouldn't let them lock the door in general, but you need to make sure they have privacy. They are going to do things you dont love no matter what is locked, but you dont want to push them away by suspecting them of doing wrong. They aren't an adult at 13, but I know when I was 13 I was perfectly able to function as an adult if I needed to but lacked a lot of wisdom and maturity. Treat them like an adult and see if they can respect your trust, and in return you need to respect their privacy by knocking and never trying to catch them “in the act"" of wrong.

Every time I’m at my boyfriend’s house he leaves me in his room to go outside and hang with friends. I tell him that he makes me feel left out but he still does it. Am I just being jealous or should I realize he just doesn’t care about how I feel?
Sorry about that! You are completely right to feel left out! Someone who truly loves you will be proud to be seen with you no matter who they are with. A healthy relationship happens when two people are willing to make sacrifices for eachother. For some reason he isnt wanting you to participate in what hes doing and if that is hurting you and your relationship, then you should tell him. If he has been made aware that its hurting you and doesn't change his behavior, then he is not looking out for you or valuing your relationship, and that's not a good person to be attached to. So, let him know how you feel and from then on it's his responsibility to change or not. Again, sorry. That really sucks!

How did you figure out your sexuality? I've been struggling with my sexuality for the past few years, switching between identifying as bi, pan, and lesbian. No matter what I identify as, it doesn't feel right.
I wouldn't worry so much about labeling your sexuality yet. It sounds like (and this may be totally wrong!) you are still in the middle of figuring things out and that isnt something that you should rush into. You dont have to have a label yet. I know it probably seems like things would be simpler if you could confidently place yourself under a specific sexual criteria, but you shouldn't have to force it. Human minds and emotions are far too wonderful and complex to be confined by a self imposed label. I'm a guy who had a crush on a guy, then dated a girl, and am now engaged to a guy. I totally thought I was straight, but that's obviously not the case;) While in the relationship with the girl, I genuinely loved her and found her very attractive, but now I feel the same way about my fiance.…

Because of “the meta they receive by them.

Why do Freemasons wear their rings with pride and openly talk about their membership in the organization, despite its reputation for secrecy?
Why do Freemasons wear their rings with pride and openly talk about their membership in the organization, despite its reputation for secrecy? Because it is not a secret, nor is it a secret Organisation. This lie has largely been propagated by the Media for sensationalism in order to sell copy, banking on the fact as we are and always have been a relatively unknown Organisation, people will believe those lies.

They do not state it bluntly like that, but I can sense that most of them dismiss the importance of medication in treating mental illnesses and insiste that therapy itself is the only key. It makes me feel bad as a patient because in a way they are saying that I am fooled to believe the theory of chemical imbalance is true since there is no tangible evidence and I am relaying on medication instead of working hard on my therapy work.

When depression is bad enough psychotherapy does not work much neither exercising nor meditation. I advice you to consult with a psychtrist. You do not have to agree on taking any medication. A consultation will help u see u options and consider what is the best option you want to take.

I’m speechless! All of this resonates so well; this answer was such an enjoyable read, this is food for thought and something I fully intend on revisiting and reading over more. It is satisfying to read a response which is expressed and presented in such a coherent way on such a complex topic. This gives me so much to think about! Being as curious as I am, there’s so many questions for everything and with art being the most fascinating enigma to me, I want to express my gratitude for extending my initial question into so much more to consider and ponder. I really do read this as being something that could open a very enriching dialogue/discussion! This is just beautiful to me. The most enjoyable read I’ve had for a while. I admire and am inspired by your passion and diligence! I am a first year college student practicing visual art; what a vast and complex world to be entering, the arts. I love getting to know the experience each individual has in response to art in any and all of its forms. I refuse to name any of my pieces for that reason, I’d rather that be left to the one who is perceiving; a title just suggests meaning for something that could be so much broader to an individual when it is presented without indication beyond the pure content of a piece.
Anyhow, I struggle with being concise with expressing my thoughts through words, reading something I am able to resonate with is so soothing in contrast to my underdeveloped and scattered thoughts on the subjects - I have a grasp for the concepts, but not always the words. This is all communicated so elegantly and effectively. So again, thank you very much for putting the time and care into rendering this answer! I would love it if you could e-mail me the PDF version of this response :)

Anyhow, I struggle with being concise with expressing my thoughts through words, reading something I am able to resonate with is so soothing in contrast to my underdeveloped and scattered thoughts on the subjects - I have a grasp for the concepts, but not always the words. This is all communicated so elegantly and effectively. So again, thank you very much for putting the time and care into rendering this answer! I would love it if you could e-mail me the PDF version of this response :)

Much appreciated!! I wish I had more to add to start more of a dialogue on here - believe me, the internal dialogue has been engaged however!
Thank you so much so such an insightful and detailed response. Just beautiful!!!

Thank you for your comment. I believe I’ve developed agoraphobia. It’s crippling. I only leave the house for doctor’s appointments and an occasional haircut. I’ve also been diagnosed with CPTSD, bipolar and BPD.
I hope you’ve recovered from COVID. I can only imagine the difficulty you experienced trying to get to the hospital.
Again, thank you for your time and information.

Religious people can be irrational in general considering some of the things they force you are required to believe, believe in order to participate in them, however in this particular case I wish the lives of women were valued more because this should never happen anywhere for any reason to anyone.

I agree with you in that a society that idolizes gun ownership needs to take a serious look at priorities. The argument about whether or not the gun is responsible in tragedies such as school shootings is a moot point because guns are specifically made to maim and/or murder quickly and in a gruesome and generally inescapable way. That's their whole point. It's not that the gun pulled its own trigger, it's that it made it exceedingly easy for a disturbed person to maim and/or kill in a quick and generally inescapable way. However, I also acknowledge that most Americans own a gun either for protection or hunting. The main issue here is that a seriously depressed person was unstable and did not get the help that she needed and thought ending her life was a better option than living to see another day. She also was able to access a deadly, high power instrument far too easily. This should never have happened in a society that can afford to mitigate this issue. This is something that needs to be tackled from both sides if society wants to be improved. It should be harder for mentally ill people to get their hands on weapons, and if that means more strict background checks then I am glad if they help society become safer as long as reasonable, stable, logical, law abiding citizens are not penalized in outlandish ways. We also need to put more effort into helping our most vulnerable citizens and make sure they can get the healthcare that they need. Just my two cents.

Like I mentioned in another comment above, it’s all well and good to cook from home when you are at home. Sometimes that’s not an option. Try traveling for two weeks without a way to cook things or a refrigerator and see how easy that is. You will soon find that you are trying to survive off a handful of raw fruits and veggies cause you can’t trust anything else. Maybe in other countries it’s better, but not in the United States sadly.

I’m so sorry to hear you had to go through this!! My heart goes out for you. For anybody that might be struggling with food, please know this. Get brown rice and beans or lentils. It may not be as tasty, but you will get much more food for the amount you are spending and so so much more nutrition. Brown rice is healthier and more nutritious than white and mixed with legumes becomes a filling meal and complete protein. You will get all your macro nutrients (fiber, protein, and carbohydrates) as well as some micro nutrients and it should fill you a lot longer. Typical bread and jam you get in the store is so full of sugar and depleted of any nutrients. nutrients.¶

I only mention this because I know there are so many people who do not know this and I would want anyone who has to go through a similar situation to be able to stay as full and healthy as possible! Sending lots of love and good thoughts!

To be honest, I feel like you're projecting and honestly being quite hypocritical. You're accusing him of exactly what you're doing right now when all he said was how lovely Africa was and how much he enjoys living there and how much the people he knows enjoy living there. He also said he was from Canada and now lives there meaning he has both perspectives from living in both places. Why are you telling him how happy people in Africa are when you have no actual experience of the truth of that statement yourself?

If God tells you to do something inhumane or clearly wrong, would you do it? Why or why not?
Of course not. Any God I follow would never ask anyone to do that, and if they did, I would know for certain that they were not God .

Which is worse, to live your life like there's a God then die & realize there isn't, or to live like there's no God then die and realize there is?
I think if you live in a way that you are not happy with solely on the belief that there is or isn't a God, you will feel regret no matter what the truth of it is. If you constantly are holding yourself back from doing things you really want to do or try because they are things that “God would be upset by” then you would likely feel regret when you die and realize there is no God. On the other hand, if you do horrible things or hurt and deceive people purely because you don't believe there is a God, you will likely regret it when you die and realize there is. The whole point is to live with balance. Live in a way that makes you happy. Live in a way that makes you proud of yourself, and go and experience all the things you want to experience even if they are considered taboo. Do what good you…

There are a lot of 'shoulds' and assumptions in here. I think one of the biggest things I've learned since discovering Quora is that there are as many unique perspectives and opinions as there are people in the world. Let people live by their beliefs as long they are not harming another being that does not wish to be harmed.

My husband and I love sex and we'd been filming ourselves and taking pictures for some time when we decided to get into the industry because it was fun; why not make some extra money doing it since we are both very comfortable with our bodies? Its been very interesting slowly revealing this to friends and family. Most have been supportive, some very judgmental and making assumptions about how we've changed or how we will change based on some biased beliefs they have, and completely forgetting who they've always known us to be or how we still are.
In my experience, every other industry worker we have encountered is very happy with what they do. They are fun, very intelligent, kind people, some with families, and usually have healthier relationships with their significant other than most other people I know not in the industry. There could be many reasons for this, (Possibly because open and honest communication is extremely important in the industry to make sure everyone feels comfortable and safe!) but it is an interesting coincidence I've found. They also seem to be very happy with what they do vs. most people I know that are not in the industry who are miserable in their jobs.
This of course has just been our experience and could very well be because people attract their surroundings and experiences. I understand that this is diverging slightly from the point the answer was making, which was just that you both had gone down different paths and felt you could no longer relate to one another. But if you both still desire the friendship, the what of what she's doing shouldn't be a deterrent; people will more often than not go down very different life paths and still remain great friends because they can still enjoy each other's company in the moment and share their stories and feelings without judgement.
Just thought I'd throw a little perspective in ;).

I feel like this whole thing was a major lack of communication, which is unfortunate. This happened once to me when my husband and I were messing around and taking nude photos of me and another girl. We continually checked in told her (like the massage therapist did), “Please do not hesitate, if at any point you are uncomfortable or don't want to do something let us know.” Well, she seemed to be having a great time and never said anything, then anything. Then about a week later it came to our knowledge that her fiance was furious and she was claiming that we made her uncomfortable and never stopped what we were doing. She never gave ANY indication that she wanted us to! Yes, it is unfortunate that you feel violated in this way, but you cannot blame the other person when they have openly communicated to you and based on this description, you never directly told him “Stop!” or “No!” at any point. As another person mentioned, this may be the type of massage he does for some of his clients and the reason he mentioned he knew the person who recommends recommended him to you was because he may have been thinking that that is why they recommended him to you, and that of if you wanted him to stop at any point you would say so. I am not trying to blame you or say it is your fault, but unless there is more to the story, it is not his either. I'm sure he would not have wanted to lose his license or livlihood and go to jail. By the sounds of It it he didn't sound like an angry or violent person so I don't believe he was intentionally trying to molest you. It was just a major lack of communication.

I taught my BabyKitty how to play soccer. It only took a couple of hours. I thought he's so smart about a lot of other things why not and if dogs can do it BabyKitty sure can!!! We play in the kitchen. He likes to either get behind the closet doors or under the table and chairs. I then kick the ball to him and he smacks it back. Of course he's better and it's his favorite game! Whenever he want to play he yowls for me in the kitchen. He likes to play on his on often too. He also looses he ball on a regular basis and I have to search for it which he loves watching me do which sometimes makes me think he hides it🥰

Great comment. I’ve dealt with so many people that don’t understand why I’m depressed, because they think we need a reason; too many people confuse depression with sadness.

I think you’re confused because I misspoke. A vaccine can also be an immunization. I just meant it doesn’t always provide 100% protection, but it does provide protection.

Thanks for providing an answer based in reality, lol.
I’m someone that’s interested in Data Sciences since it’s involved in so many industries and involves using tools from other disciplines, and somehow started looking at Quora a few days ago. I was surprised at the amount of misinformation being being spread by peopled that are supposedly professionals.
Since they were spreading things that are pretty much opposite to what’s actually going on, I got curious and looked at their previous comments. To no surprise, they’ve never practiced in the profession they teach, don’t have academic credentials related to their field of work, zero endorsements on LinkedIn in real world skills he supposedly practices daily, and actually advises regularly against obtaining degrees, and entered the tech industry at a time when academic curriculum wasn’t widely available.
I’m kinda ranting now and shouldn’t be surprised an individual this person from my nation’s bible belt is preaching nonsense to uneducated but it kind of irritates me. Despite my Quora account being old, I just started browsing a few days ago and already thinking about deactivating my account.
Thanks again for being a true professional and providing truthful answers without resorting to fallacies in this hell hole.

Thank you.
What’s even more disturbing and frightening to me is the frequency you see them hanging around these communities regarding depression as if they’re intentionally targeting vulnerable persons. I find it very disturbing when people try to impose their religion on others during a time of need.
I’m agnostic and have read a little bit of every but don’t believe in any religion. Religions distort the holy scriptures and texts they’re based on as each religion has adjusted their texts to conform with their founders personal beliefs. If there were indeed a higher level being or beings that created us, any message they passed along has been corrupted by humans over time.
Then there’s the fact they’re spreading this stuff in a mental health community. How are they going to convince us all the authors of these scripts didn’t have mental health issues themselves? 🤣

As I said in my other post, you’re very misguided and are only thinking about yourself despite being in a thread about depression. You seem to be in the wrong area but I can help guide you to the right one, Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
People with narcissism tend to have symptoms that overlap with those of depression. Here’s the symptom, I understand you think your time is important so you won’t completely read it as you seem to have a history of not completely reading thing, so I’ll highlight the relevant symptoms:
Narcissistic personality disorder
Inflated sense of their own importance
You think I’m replying to you in a public forum to give you attention.
A deep need for excessive attention and admiration
You spread lies and misinformation and act like you’re a person of authority or someone that’s knowledgeable in a subject to get others to listen to you.
He’s very proud of his upvotes and uses the Ad Populum fallacy to suggest that he’s correct.correct. To him quora isn’t about answer questions truthfully but to get the biggest reactions from people, he only cares about popularity.
Troubled relationships
Look around, you don’t get along with anyone.
A lack of empathy for others
Again, you tell lies, call others liars, and spread misinformation in a forum where there’s many vulnerable people in an attempt to gain attention while putting real people’s lives at risks.
A mask of extreme confidence that hides their fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.
This one is extremely obvious due to your reaction to the resources I posted disproving your falsehoods and you attempted to lash out at me for doing so.
Instead of producing counter-arguments, he used a red herring fallacy to deflect, saying I moved away from the original topic. Yet, he started attacking others and calling them liars without any evidence thinking that was okay but as soon as he became the topic and shown to only produce anecdotal evidence, he considered everything an attack on him dwindling his self-esteem.

Make assumptions about me all you want, I’ve only introduced facts to you but yet again you’re trying to distort the truth (lie). Come from another post? Nope, I only took a look at your post history to try and understand why you were trying to call someone else a liar while lying at the same time.
Now you’re trying to apply emotion and say I’m full of hatred despite posting in a neutral tone this entire time. Again, lying.
You also think you have a follower just because I presented facts to you and spent a modicum of my time giving you “attention?” Isn’t having an ego haram? You think I’m that affectionate towards you? Again with the assumptions. Open your eyes for once, you’re in a thread about depression and the only reason I spent any time on the other replies is because depression is a serious disorder. You downplaying it, calling others liars, or telling them they never had it can get someone killed. I spent time on those responses to disprove you faulty logic and misinformation, because I don’t want others that are going through it to see what you’re saying and think what you’re saying is true.
It’s very easy to do research in these modern times, I highly recommend you try it sometimes to try and actually learn something. For example, I just googled what Islam says about treating others. Here’s a few verses I found highly relevant to you and what you’re doing:
Regarding telling the truth.
“Mention too, in the Qur’an, the story of Idris. He was a man of truth, a prophet.” (Quran 19:56)
Value of Kindness
“O Messenger of Allah! It is a great Mercy of God that you are gentle and kind towards them; for, had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would all have broken away from you.” (Quran 3:159)
Hospitality to Strangers
“When they [the angels] came to him [Abraham], they said: ‘Peace’; he said: ‘Peace also be to you; (you seem to be) a group of strangers.’” (Quran 51:25)
What you obviously didn’t read
“O you who believe, do not let one set of people make fun another; do not insult one another by calling each other names; do not spy on one another, or spread rumours about each other or criticize people behind their backs.” (Quran 49: 10-12)
If you think any of this took me more than several minutes, then you’re sorely mistaken, friend. I do hope you go back to reread your book but this time please pay attention to the messages being given. I don’t usually pray but I’ll pray for your salvation despite not knowing you. Spreading lies and misinformation is downright evil, but despite your misguided ways I hope your God can show enough mercy to you. He seems very just and unforgiving though. Oh well, have a good day.
Edit: Well, Che Art seems to only reply to non-muslims using ad hominems. Any bit of evidence that shows he’s being ridiculous and what he says is completely wrong damages his ego, so instead of making solid argument based on truths or facts he just continues to spread lies and hate.

I understand, depression can distort the mind a lot and it can be really tough at times to see clearly. Apologies if I came off a little too harsh, I get frustrated at these posts also because there’s too many people that have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about.
There’s so many responding that aren’t doctors, mental health professionals, or seem to even have the slightest bit of experience dealing with the issues of depression and they stuff they think will help is complete bull crap. Just know that there’s actual resources out there that can help us mitigate our symptoms and live a functioning life. The stuff Barbara mentioned are things that always get recommended by mental health professionals and organizations. Apologies again, Rachel. I hope you have a good day

Unfortunately that is blatantly false and your statement is easily proven untrue by either googling symptoms of depression or for help managing depression. Facts aren’t based on anecdotal evidence, which is the kind you’re using.
A symptom of depression is indeed lower energy or fatigue but it isn’t a requirement for someone to be “clinically depressed.” Awareness, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Depression
A symptom of being unable to get out of bed is most likely a different type of mood disorder though.

If you have no idea what depression is, stop going around and claiming people “are not depressed.”
In your own words, “Is it fair if you scam 100 people and get away with it in this world and go to heaven?”
So why are you lying to people on the internet? Does your God not care what you do or how you treat others online? Right before the previous quote you mention, “Is it fair if you harm your neighbours and you go to heaven? Is it fair if you hurt people and go to heaven?” So I guess he does care.
Clearly you never experienced depression also because you decided to come here and lie about it. While a lack of motivation can be one of the symptoms, it’s not in everyone so stop using a anecdotal fallacy to argue about something being true based on your experience. It makes you look ignorant and frankly, it makes you look like wisdom never caught up with you.
These are the 9 symptoms associated with depression, and to be clinically diagnosed you need 5 of them to last a duration of two weeks or more (TIP: Lack of motivation or laziness is not a formal symptom of depression Why Some People Think Depression Is Laziness):
Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.†
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children, failure to make expected weight gains.
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
Awareness, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Depression
Hopefully, your God is more merciful and forgiving than you claim. You going around and spreading information as absolute truths based on experience due to being ignorant of the actual facts isn’t a good reason for spreading lies and being toxic to others. Especially when your lies are about as something as serious as depression, people die from it and instead of being helpful you’re suggesting tips that help are false, trying to turn people away from helping themselves.

The question asks “how do I get help overcoming depression” not “in your experience what are the best ways for overcoming depression.” Most of what Barbara Hasslacher has stated has been proven effective through studies and the observation of patients by their doctors.
You didn’t even bother to take her first advice “first do some research online” to see that these tips are commonly given by actual organizations based on research, not individual experiences.
Plus she says do things that “resonate with you,” which means in English that you don’t need to do all items. Just a little bit will help.
Also, since you seem argumentative and very unlikely to do your own research, instead of basing things on your own experience, I did some research for you.

[I think psychiatry is doing away with the term ADD and now it’s just ADHD but there’s like 3–4 different “classes” of it]
I’ve never done an official IQ test, but growing up there was tons of frustration from my teachers towards me.
All the ways through High School, I turned in very little homework but I would get good grades on all my exams. With how grading went, I was able to pass my classes with a B or C due to high exam scores and minimal homework. As soon as I’d get home, I’d forget about school and do something entertaining such as watching t.v., play on the computer or play video games (these all became the target as to why I was doing so bad).
In addition to not doing homework, if the class wasn’t covering something particularly interesting to me I would not focus at all. If I wasn’t falling asleep during that class, I was talking to classmates, or drawing in my notes. I was a nuisance as I was ‘causing a disruption in the class, which led to many counsellings. Teachers would tell me how smart I was, how I wasn’t reaching my potential, imply that I was lazy, and math teachers in HS would accuse me of cheating (I did the best on math exams).
Unsurprisingly, after joining the Marines I also had issues focusing and would constantly get in trouble for being lazy and forgetful. I did end up working with someone that was kicked out of an MOS he signed up for, Air Traffic Controller, due to him having ADHD. I’d heard of ADHD before but just figured it to be a illness some people had, nobody ever accused me of having it or even suggesting I did so up to this point I never even imagined myself being affected by a mental illness. After he told me his symptoms and stuff he went through in life, it all just started to click in my head that I had experienced similar things in life.
Being in the Marines makes you become self-conscious about what others think of you, there’s a certain appearance you want to keep without showing weaknesses, so I didn’t seek treatment.
After being in 9 years, I went to medical and told them I thought I had ADHD. The doctor had me fill out a form about my childhood, the Marine in me took over and I didn’t fill it out truthfully. It asked questions about how I did in school and I thought because I passed classes, I didn’t do that bad. The doctor ended up diagnosing me depression, which I agreed with because I had experiences that could’ve led to that outcome.
After the military, I went to college and did horribly. Unlike childhood education, a lot of college courses place more emphasis on doing homework than exams which made my earlier methods obsolete.
Told my new doctor about my troubles and once again I filled out the form in an identical way to before. Based on my answers, he said I didn’t have ADHD. Continued doing horribly and told him about 2 years later, I explained everything I was going through and all the symptoms I thought were related to ADHD, he agreed I probably have ADHD but said he couldn’t diagnose me unless I answered the questionnaire a certain way. This whole time I thought I’d get diagnosed based on my symptoms and experiences but it was all based on that single form.
Well, after getting diagnosed I did much better in school but still not good enough, so I dropped out.
Being treated for ADHD is great, but if you’re getting treated after being diagnosed as an adult you need to realize old habits die hard. Medication without changing old habits will still lead to disaster. As a child growing up, I never learned to study, take notes, do homework or work with others because I didn’t need to. Now I need to change my way of life and learn all those things I missed as a child.
Anyone reading this, please realise that issues affecting a child’s behaviour can be a lot more complex than they seem. Don’t immediately blame the most obvious things, such as computers/video games, etc. Try to look deeper and see the entire picture.

Vaccines provide protection against a disease, it doesn’t make you immune to it.
Vaccines are a preparation that is used to stimulate the body's immune response against diseases. So people who are vaccinated have more anti-bodies available to fight whatever disease they’re preparing for, which minimizes the effects.
Sure, people that are vaccinated are still getting COVID but I think it’s more relevant to mention who’s actually still dying from it.

I promised my son a PS5 if he got straight A's and he did, but I don’t want to give him a ps5. What should I do?
Don’t get him the PS5. Break your promise and let your son realize what kind of person you are.
Hopefully they’ll see you as an example of what kind of person they shouldn’t be, but more likely he’ll turn into you and lie/manipulate people to get what he wants in the future.

I would certainly recommend a philosophical approach (but not a spiritual one). It's often assumed that philosophers simply understand the philosophy of a subject. In reality we need to understand the latest developments in neuroscience, psychology and other areas. We read widely around our subject.
Philosophy does not simply exist in a vacuum, it looks at these developments and applies philosophical tools and methods of examination to look at them in a critical way as an outsider and not a member of the currently favoured scientific model (being a member of which can lead to a number of unconscious biases). Philosophers don't simply sit around and make guesses.
I am, as you may have guessed, a philosopher. I'm currently researching consciousness to put it briefly, and I read books from the fields of cognitive sciences, psychology and of course philosophy. Although I'm a philosopher now I have also studied Mathematics and Energy Engineering at university so I completely understand the importance of science but am also acutely aware of the logical errors and inconsistencies that can be made in the enthusiastic grasp for scientific advancements. Philosophers specialised in these areas can question the developments in a fresh way, possibly revealing weaknesses or even unnoticed avenues in which the science may go.
Looking from the outside with a different perspective can be very enlightening for all involved.

Can nihilist people love?
Yes, of course they can. Anyone who denies this is denying the existence of a natural and powerful human condition. It's like asking “can nihilists smell flowers”. Again, of course they can. Nihilists can love and do love. As a nihilist you accept that in the 'big picture’, in the ‘eyes’ of an uncaring, neutral universe, in the absence of any greater, objective, all pervading set of absolute laws and truths regarding the human condition, and that's what it's really about, the human condition. The apparent conscious, thinking, wondering, needing biological accident that humans are, you accept that there is no absolute, objective, pre-existing meaning or purpose to life. You accept that (again) in the big picture that whatever you do, whatever happens to you, whatever you feel, care for or love…

Well Mark, it's been interesting talking to you and hearing your take on things. If you're so sure regarding your theories maybe you should find an influential, open-minded physicist who is willing to listen and put them forward.

The thing is Mark, physics doesn't require you to buy into it. It's not a matter of opinion or preference, you can't just decide what you like and then support that as the correct theory. A singularity at the centre of a black hole is where the mathematics of General Relativity lead to and, so far, GR has been shown to be true on every occasion at every scale. Believe me, I don't like it either, it seems wrong somehow and is very counterintuitive, but just because we don't like it, don't understand it or just don't believe it that doesn't mean it's not true. There's a whole lot of maths and physics that runs counter to our everyday experience but is still true nonetheless.
The nature or structure of the actual singularity isn't fully understood. In fact if you walk into the physics department of any reputable university or research institution they should tell you that the physics and maths we have so far just aren't adequate to understand a singularity, all those infinities freak out physicists in particular, to them is a sign that something in our understanding is wrong or incomplete.
You may have heard that the grand mission of physics is to unite general relativity with quantum mechanics. It is in singularities that they cannot be united - quantum mechanics says that there can be no such thing as an infinitely small space or an infinite density and so a singularity cannot exist. This is at the forefront of current research and theoretical physics where ideas such as Quantum Loop Gravity and String Theory compete amongst others to unite the two most successful and well demonstrated scientific theories devised by humans GR and QM.
What I've told you in our discussion is the state of our understanding as it currently exists. Please don't misunderstand what I'm saying, most of it is understood and has been shown to be true time and time again but there are very important details to figure out. I haven't attacked your ideas for the sake of it, I hoped that the knowledge I have gained in this area over many years could help you see where your ideas differ from what has been proven.
We are creatures that evolved in a 3 dimensional world where our main concern was survival and reproduction. Our brains didn't evolve to understand these elements of nature, and that's why we often find ourselves completely at odds with what we are told - it just doesn't make sense intuitively because our brains haven't evolved to be able to picture it (try picturing 4 dimensions)- that's where maths comes in.
I hope you continue to question and pose alternative theories, that's pretty much what theoretical physicists do from within an understanding of established scientific principles. Find a good physics forum and ask questions. Make your own suggestions and ask if they make any sense and if not then why not. Who knows, you might be the one to spot something that everyone else has missed - I've thought I might have done that a few times only to find that someone had already suggested it and had been shown why it was incorrect. We're all on a journey of learning.
If you want any suggestions for good reading in this area with or without maths filling up big areas of the pages I'm happy to suggest what I know of.
Best wishes, Andrew

Black holes are indeed different sizes, you may have heard of Solar Mass Black Holes, Supermassive Black Holes and even more recently discovered Intermediate Mass Black Holes. They are also different in size, but that is generally in terms of their Event Horizons and not the singularity at their core. They also have different gravitational influence, a supermassive black hole has not only a much bigger event horizon but also a much, much bigger gravitational influence than for example a solar mass black hole. For example, the super massive black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy (Sagittarius A*) has a mass of around 4,000,000 suns and this itself is small compared to some, the Andromeda galaxy has a supermassive black hole about 20x over 25 times the size of our own Sagittarius A*.
I think the misunderstanding you're making is between the size of the event horizon which does vary and the 'size' of the singularity at its core which does not. The reason that the size of the event horizon and gravitational influence vary is not due to the infinite density of the singularity, but its mass. Just as our sun has a bigger gravitational influence than the earth due to the difference in mass (not density). I'm sure you'll remember the relationship between mass and density from school physics where density=mass/volume.
It is thought that when a star collapses to form a black hole the mass collapses under its own gravity to form a singularity where the density becomes infinite not because of whatever mass it has but because the volume (in the equation above) becomes zero. Any amount of mass compacted into zero space has an infinite density. As you might remember dividing by zero (the volume) in the above equation gives an undefined answer which is often simply referred to as infinite.
So, at the centre of all black holes is an area of infinite density called a singularity, but singularities can have different masses and this is why we have black holes with hugely different gravitational influences and vastly different sizes in terms of their event horizons.
The event horizon of Sagittarius A* (our galaxy's super massive black hole) is approximately 44 million km whereas the diameter of a 3 solar mass black hole (about the minimum for collapse into a black hole) is about 13.5km and the difference in mass is, as mentioned above, about 4,000,000 solar masses to 3 solar masses. It is this MASS that makes the difference and not the density.
There is a difference when we're talking about the centre of gravity of the Earth, thankfully the Earth hasn't collapsed under its own mass to form a black hole and it never will because their simply isn't enough mass to overcome the forces pushing out (the same is true of our sun, it will never collapse into a black hole). The centre of gravity is a different concept, the centre of gravity of a body of matter is an imaginary point at which the entire weight of the body seems to act. There is no suggestion that there is a singularity at the centre of the Earth or a bowling ball for example, which also has a centre of gravity.

Einstein thought singularities would not occur in nature, that some mechanism would prevent their formation though he fully accepted the mathematical implications of his own theory (General Relativity). I don't believe he made any comment about event horizons.

You can't just decide on the structure of a black hole because that's what you believe. It takes more than that. You don't believe there's a singularity at the centre of a black hole, well that puts you in a very small minority and the other side of the argument you find most astrophysicists and the mathematical implications of Einstein's General Relativity and the development of that mathematics to its limit by Schwarzschild who demonstrated that the inevitable conclusion of gravitational collapse was a singularity. Of course Einstein didn't like the idea, he thought some natural process would prevent it. What a singularity is, however, is technically the point at which our current understanding of physics breaks down, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a singularity - a point with zero volume of infinite density in which time stops and all sorts of 'infinities’ seem to result from the mathematics (which physicists don't generally like). As much as it's fun to think of other possibilities for the centre of a black hole - plank stars, quark stars, boson stars, worm holes etc it's not really wise to just make up a ‘theory’ because you like it that way and point others to it as if it had some validity.

I am atypical and can really say, I have often felt the same ways. Also, so strange that im asking for you to begin corresponding with me, and perhaps giving me some insight for my 19 yr old son being autistic, I hope you see my 1st comment.
I feel like always like young but body getting old and face old. Then its relative, like I'm 44 so around a bunch of 30 yr olds I'm still calling them kids. I have not worked since 23ish. I do not have friends and I do not drive and I do not go out much but I really need to attend church. As it is written. We are to gather together and worship God. Edifying one another. Building each other up…

Thats something I would like to know, be careful just as each person diagnosed with autism is unique so is each typical minded person unique and an individual 1st. That said as a whole some traits and behavior can be generalized. Like how the majority acts like your not even there. Hardly speaking to you once your older….seems they are nervous of your autism?

You can chat with me. Im 44 married. I can not say that I do not also have reasons for asking you to speak. Anyone who needs a chat i always do offer, but when I read “suicide “ my heart dropped into my stomach and fear deepened and came to the forefront yet again. My firstborn, my boy, my 19 year old son is high functioning autistic. He does not tell his friends. He keeps alot inside. I worry so much, so much. I know how I feel, having no friends now. It sucks and not working, I'm borderline (don't by the stigma please) , depression, ptsd, anxiety/panic, some autistic traits. Which my son tells me there should be autistic traits showing up in relatives before the initial baby is born that manifests the diagnosis. I hate it is called a disorder. Maybe if everyone could except different ways of accumulating, processing, and storing information as a gift. Now the social anxiety is no kidding no joke all as a grade schooler too. Its like he realizes everything before he's matured enough to handle what he sees. I see things, straight to the heart of some people. I have to cope, had alot of trauma and abuse starting therapist says before I remember. So I protect him from the same fate but made him worried from asking him about it? O feel so guilty about all mistakes I've made. Maybe we can keep each other company and maybe some good advice?

Took 16 years for my diagnosis.
Just to get out of bed is awful.
I went to the hospital for physical ailments, digestive problems that hurt badly. A nurse who had seen me in b4 psych was smiling and coming in my room even though he wasn't my nurse that visit. My doctor orders me up Haldol and bendryl, what they use is psych for fits except usually its Ativan and Haldol. This dude was laughing, I get going crazy for my stomach problems and yelling, therefore shooting myself in my own foot and reinforcing his gossip is truth! How frustrating this gets. Smh.

Is it okay if my 'skincare routine' for my body and face only involves washing and applying moisturizer? Should I be doing more?
You should definitely wear sunscreen or a day cream with spf of at least 25. Not only for reducing your likelihood of developing skin cancer, but because most aging is caused by sun damage and some skin conditions can be exacerbated by irritation from sun damage. Most dermatologists would recommend you only really need to wear spf, cleanse it off effectively at the end of the day, and replace your skins’ natural moisture if necessary, so you are very close to a good basic skin routine! You do need to ensure that you apply enough spf for it to have the advertised effect-which is around half a teaspoon for the face. Another important consideration is to let it set for around 15 minutes away from sunlight as the active ingredients can degrade and become useless if not. Finally you may be concer…

How do I get clearer and whiter skin? My skin looks aging and I have huge pores.
I would strongly recommend using a chemical exfoliant. I currently use one called cosrx blackhead power liquid, and I think it might work well for you also as not only does it contain bha, but niacinimide too which are both scientifically proven to reduce the appearance of pores and help smooth skin. Niacinimide can also help brighten your skin tone. Bha is supposed to help combat excess oiliness, personally I have not noticed that effect but you might.
BHA Blackhead Power Liquid
This link is an example, you can find this product many places worldwide with a bit of searching. I’m not sponsored or affiliated in any way with this brand, but it is what I personally use, and I just want to help other people unhappy because of skin problems.

How do I make a simple, natural looking make up with cheap products? I really don't know nor do I look good with all those contouring stuffs.
I would suggest that you consider application technique more than products. A lot of beauty youtubers etc apply an awful lot of makeup which can look great, particularly on camera but is not suited to you or the look you want. Lisa Eldridge has a great video on how she applies foundation to look very natural. Blend, use a light hand and as little product as possible.

How can I make my skin beautiful and glowy?
Depending on your age, level of acne and skin in general you may want to look into finding an alternative to benzoyl peroxide as it can damage your moisture barrier and cause skin to appear dull, as well as causing problems with sebum regulation. When I realised that years of using benzoyl peroxide had made my skin lose that healthy sheen from a good moisture barrier, I just babied it, using a very gentle calming cleanser from lush (called aqua marina but I think it’s discontinued), thayers witch hazel and tea tree oil mixed with rosehip oil. It didn’t control acne as well, but my skin looked healthier overall. In my experience using a chemical exfoliant is what gives maximum glow, however that would be too much with daily clarisonic use and benzoyl peroxide, and is not a very ‘natural’ solu…

How do I remove my face spots?
These marks are called post inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH), and they can be a pain to deal with! I also have them, so I’ll try and share as many things I’ve heard of that could help. First of all, if you don’t already you absolutely need to be wearing sunscreen with spf 30 at least, every single day. Any sun exposure will be making the marks much darker, and most treatments that are proven to work will increase your skins photosensitivity. I know sunscreen can be comedogenic, thick and greasy feeling, so to avoid more acne it would probably be worth investing in a really nice light effective one. I can’t live without Paula’s Choice calm for oily skin, and a lot of asian brands have sunscreens I’ve heard great things about that are slightly more affordable, e.g. Biore, Missha, Innisfr…

Can using a new skin product have a negative short-term effect but a positive long-term effect?
It depends on the product, some ingredients such as retinoids, ahas and bha are almost guaranteed to cause ‘purging’ but in the long run can give dramatic improvements in skin condition. If this is something happening to you I would recommend looking into the product ingredients and doing a little research. If it doesn’t contain anything known to cause purging then it isn’t a good product/doesn’t work for you.
Personally using a retinol serum made my breakouts worse for a few months, as well as causing a lot of sensitivity, redness and flaking, which was hard to get through, but after that my skin dramatically improved and it was worth it.

My parents are just 'traditional' Asian parents. there was nothing really 'traumatic' in my childhood.. what caused me to be so bipolar?
While bipolar definitely has a genetic or ‘predisposed’ element to it, life stressors, trauma and other factors (even things like your mother contacting the flu while pregnant) can contribute to activating it. If you’re asking about your parents then it seems you feel there’s a link and they maybe didn’t treat you very well and are justifying it as traditional. Only you can really be the judge of that. If you’re able to access it, therapy with a psychologist could help you work through things in your past that could be causing or exacerbating mood swings. If not, the internet is replete with self help but it isn’t usually as effective as working with a professional you trust, can build a good relationship with and who can be objective about your problems. I hope you can find the answers yo…

They should never have made a costume for Maui as there is no way to respectfully replicate the tattoos. I know many polynesians/pasifika people who are angered by the character design including the tattoos and are horrified by the production of this costume. It is not necessary to make every conceivable form of merchandise. There is not a dichotomy between inclusion and appropriation, cultural exchange and ‘representaion’ can occur without falling back on old colonial tropes and profiting off communities with no accountability to them.

I think you are overlooking a third option here which is producing our own media and frankly imo the most important. This is held back in a number of ways such as financing and distribution but it does happen nevertheless. While I am not averse to cultural exchange, I don’t think it’s surprising that people are horrified by this costume and perhaps if you bothered to do some research you might understand why. Not all representation is good or welcome. I find ulyses comment quite amusing as yes tattoos like these are actually tapu, sacred. Producing tattooed skin costumes is quite horrifying in the historical context of europeans collecting tattooed remains of polynesian people. I also think it is reprehensible to make profit off the cultures of some of the most impoverished and dispossessed peoples when none of that profit is going to go back to the communities who rightfully own their cultural practices/intellectual property. So, to reiterate a very important third option to encourage ‘diversity’ without veering into appropriation is financing and distributing the work of people from non-white ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, which would create fair and equitable cultural exchange as well as empowering oppressed communities.

How have Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders responded to Moana?
I don’t think it has been released in NZ yet, and i probably won’t pay to see it tbh but i have been watching it’s development with some trepidation. Obviously not all pasifika people/polynesians have the same response. I think many parents are glad that their kids will finally be able to see a disney princess like them. However personally I have some concerns, as do many others. I heartily dislike the way the producers/showrunners whatever set out to make the film, claiming to have fallen in love with the south pacific, then smooshing together a large number of cultures that are related but distinct, and seeming to hire just about any poly they could get their hands on. As much as i love a lot of Taika Waititi’s work, I think he sold us all out here although he may have been trying to hav…

thank u sir …for such a brief reply …what I am asking is that for instance
I have a fraction let’s call it
1/3
and I have to find the equivalent fraction
for that I will multiply the numerator and denominator by 2
so I will get
2/6 and
4/12 so on….
In this example can i multiply the fraction by any other number other then 2 would that fraction still be called equivalent
Like in the above example if I have the fraction 1/3 can Multiply it with 3 it will be
3/9
9/18
Will this be equivalent
For 1/3 or the above answer is suitable

This most definitely has to do with the common stigma around autism. To the uneducated, autism = mentally disabled. They only see autistic people like the girl in Sia’s movie “Music”. They believe that autistic people cannot do anything by themselves and require constant care. These people see you as a caricature of your condition and not as an actual person. You can try to teach them more about autism and how to just treat you as a regular person. If they are unreceptive, you can simply go low contact with them, or cut them out altogether. You don’t need to interact with people who treat you poorly and refuse to learn how to treat you better. I wish you the best of luck.

There's a really cute boy I like and he's openly questioning his heterosexuality, he's 12 and im 13, would it be legal and acceptable for us to get together and date online? He is from Ontario and im from Minnesota.
Well, there’s a few things to consider here. First of all, it’s not illegal to date (online or irl) at your age, as long as it doesn’t cross certain lines. It’s normal to want to start dating around your age - even I had my first relationship at 13. However, it’s definitely illegal and risky to sext or share sexual photos of yourselves or at this age, so save that until you’re both at least 18. Second, if he is still questioning, he may not be comfortable with flirting or being in a relationship yet. The best thing to do is either wait until he makes a move (which may take a while or not happen at all) or simply ask him out without beating around the bush. If he is still unsure or says no, it would be better to just drop it and stay as friends. Third, since you are still young, you are still…

There’s been a lot of hate in recent media directed at straight white men, especially on apps like Tiktok and Twitter. I’m guessing you’ve exposed yourself to a lot of this media. While it is true that straight white men are responsible for a large portion of crime in the United States, that doesn’t make that specific group evil or less human. Many straight white men are just regular, decent citizens. Please don’t actually hurt or harrass anyone, and I’d suggest you see a therapist if these violent/hateful thoughts persist or get worse.

Is anyone here on the autism spectrum? And do you feel like that changes your experience as LGBT+?
Hi, I’m a bisexual girl with Asperger’s Syndrome! My autistic aspects were a lot stronger when I was younger (back when I didn’t know LGBTQ+ was a thing), but as I’ve gotten older, it’s heard you tel hard to tell that I’m autistic at all (although I set I’ll still have my moments). I don’t think it influences my perception or experience of the LGBTQ+ community, just people in general. Although it’s hard for me to understand that gender aspects since I’m cisgender, I generally like and actively participate in/understand the community.

When was the last time you cried and why?
It was two days ago, in fact. One of my best friends has a cat named Buster. (The picture below is of him, taken yesterday.) Buster is 13 years old and very skinny. Despite this, he’s an incredibly animated and affectionate cat. I’ve never met another cat like him. I love this cat as if he were my own. Well, my friend told me that he’s been unwell recently - he barely eats or drinks, and he hasn’t moved from one spot in the house for a week (unless it’s to use the litter box). All he does is sleep. He feared Buster was dying from age and that he may have to be put down. So I went over to his house to see Buster in case the worst-case scenario was true. When I walked in the house and saw him, the poor baby was all skin and bones. Despite this, he got up to meow at me (weakly) in greeting, l…

Firstly, only you yourself know your own gender and sexuality best, even though I still think you’re a bit young and still discovering yourself. Second, I don’t think you’re broken, just misunderstood. Third, you need to find a better therapist if they really think/said you’re just “doing it for attention.” That’s a really shitty mindset to have and it doesn’t benefit the client/patient in any way. You probably can’t do anything about your family though, so I’m really sorry you’re stuck with them. That must feel very isolating.

Well, for starters, sexuality is fluid. It’s not necessarily the same all the time, but usually it stays within more or less the same boundaries for each person. I doubt you’re ace though, because being ace would mean you never ever get turned on by anything. Maybe you’re in the graysexual spectrum at best, but to me it sounds like you’re just experiencing a change in libido, and you’ll be turned on again by whatever you’re into soon enough. And you don’t necessarily even need to put a definitive label on your sexuality, but it’s okay if you prefer to anyway if it makes you feel comfortable. You’re still young and you have time to figure things out, no need to rush :)

The only scenarios that I can think of where you'd get a bill is when you have an alarm system that keeps getting set off for no reason and they keep having to send peopl. people. In that case, it's more of a way to keep alarm owners responsible and aware of the issues an ongoing problem can cause. Now if it's going off for LEGIT purposes, no matter if it's 7 days in a row (worst luck/case scenario) they will still not bill the owner. And if you file false police reports they may decide to bill you especially if it is something that you continue to do.
Also, if you have someone calling an ambulance for let's say a toothache and they INSIST on getting a ride to the hospital… they WILL get a bill for it and insurance will most likely not pay for any of it as it wasn't a medical necessity.
The hospitals in my area have a program for lower income families as well. You fill out some paperwork and if you qualify then you pay little to nothing. I'm not sure of the requirements for this but I do know that the staff makes sure to give out the paperwork to people who may potentially need it. That's about all I know about that though.

I'm so sorry, somehow I missed your reply until now! I had to get non stress tests done twice a week and see my dr once a week and was induced at 37 weeks when there was very little room for her to grow and the fluid level was also so cramped that it didn't serve to benefit her in any way to stay in. She was able to move to the delivery position just fine but they can usually be moved to that position by an ultrasound guided doctor if need be. Babies are also born in breech positions rather frequently. As far as kicks, she could easily make her entire foot stick out up to an inch from my stomach! She kicked her toddler brother through my stomach and he thought it was me! Ha! Sibling rivalry began early! Once my labor started, I had a very easy delivery and could possibly have done so at home as I had already dilated to 2 cm when they induced me. She would kick the inside of my ribs, which had stretched to allow her room and it started to get painful as she developed. They did tests on the placenta and found no reason why she got so restricted which is apparently just a fluke that happens. She was my 3rd child and I gained plenty of weight on the other two but she was like a weight loss plan for me lol. Two weeks after I had her, I weighed at least 10 lbs less than before I got pregnan. I was walking 2 miles and running a quarter mile everyday. The other soccer moms hated me! I would have her strapped to my chest and they'd find out how old she was and that she was indeed mine. My OBGYN told me about the minimal weight gain I had that everything was just fine but that he wouldn't suggest bragging to other mothers about it! Ha! Oh, you could watch her foot and see all her toes when she stuck it out and rolled 😏 it was a very weird but amazing experience

How do I cope with my mum whose been married to and suffered abuse of all kinds from a narc for over 60 years who actually defends him (my father)?
I'm in the exact same situation. Here is what I do… I keep my distance and know that whatever he may say, it is NOT me, it's HIM. I stopped seeking his approval a long time ago so I am living my best life for me! Mine have been married around 45 years now and I'm helping others in my family learn to cope as well. I'm not perfect and I occasionally let it get to me as to why my mother doesn't want more out of life and worry about her a lot. And I married someone like him and had to come to that realization and make a correction in myself and realize that love is NOT SUPPOSED to hurt like that! It took almost all of the first 35 years of my 40 years here on earth to get here but I'm married to an amazing man and have learned how much peace and comfort can be found in the right kind of love.…

They were SUPPOSED to. I signed up for Alabama's victim notification for that very purpose. However, they didn't. I called the prison a couple of days after he was released and they told me he'd been released and I asked why I wasn't notified! He had no answer for me other than that it wasn't his responsibility and sorry but they can't guarantee that anyone will get a call!!! I have a concealed carry permit and have since he was put in jail and always try to carry so that if I were to happen upon him, I'll be ok. However, he's now moved into his next victim, and she has a young daughter. She knew what he was in prison for so she can't say she didn't know. But her daughter doesn't deserve to have to go through what he's doing to them, she's innocent!

Can I have a restraining order modified for a certain place?
You should be able to modify it for a lot of different things. Find a petition to modify online or in your county forms or even at your local courthouse in the county you got the restraining order in, fill it out and file it. There will probably be a hearing on the matter at hand and after the hearing you'll get an original order of the court. I had to have the timing extended on mine as in Alabama permanent means TWO YEARS and my ex wasn't getting out of prison until AFTER that time so I have specific wording in mine that says it's permanent and DOES NOT EXPIRE BY THE PASSAGE OF TIME. So mine will never expire thank goodnes. goodness. But it took several trips to the courthouse for hearings before I finally got everything set up the way it needed to be. Hope this helps! Good luck to you and stay strong! 💪

If a child's birth certificate shows the husband's name at birth for 9 years and then it is proven that another man is the father, can the mother prevent the name change on the birth certificate? The child already identifies as the husband's name.
You can name your child anything you want, it doesn't have to even be your maiden name or dad's last name. If Bio Dad goes to court to add his name to the birth certificate then it can't be stopped. HOWEVER, if the Bio Dad doesn't want to be added, you CAN terminate his parental rights and have the current dad legally adopt the child. I'd talk to Bio Dad and tell him how much back child support he owes then ask if he'll terminate his rights and let current dad adopt. Usually in the face of a l...

How can a healthy, slim girl deliver a 7 pound healthy baby at 9 months (usually 25-35 pounds of weight gain) while only gaining 3 pounds?
I gained 5 lbs total in my pregnancy and had a 6 lb 4 oz healthy baby girl! Her baby was stuck inside her rib cage so her growth was restricted as mine was. My uterus stopped growing around 34 cm, which is the 34 weeks measurement. My daughter was cramped on space and she grew just fine but there was very little amniotic fluid by the end of my pregnancy. I had to be induced at 38 weeks when the level was getting too close for comfort. I had to see my doctor 1 to 2 times a week PLUS 2 nonstress tests a week so I spent 3 to 4 days a week at Dr's offices for the last 2 months! So yeah, it IS possible to have very little weight gain and still have a healthy sized baby. I barely looked 5 months pregnant when I was 38 weeks!!! Then left the hospital weighing less than when I got pregnant! While…

Can I get as little as 1 year in jail for 1st degree domestic assault?
Some people get suspended sentences which means they have a sentence of however many years or months but they'll only be on probation for a certain amount of time unless they screw up. Depends on if this is your first felony or 2nd, 3rd, etc…. The sentencing guidelines go up for every conviction you get. Get a great attorney, go to anger management classes and I agree with the other answer…. STOP HITTING PEOPLE!!!

How do I handle the negative tenancy record due to being a victim of domestic violence (in 2013)? I went to court per the summons, and it was dismissed against me then. Now it's popping up on my rental history. The court says they destroyed the file.
That sounds more like an offender issue than that of a victim! If you are the offender and it was dismissed then you should be able to get copies of your dismissal paperwork… if you're the victim, then a rental company will not have access to your file! If the court SAYS they destroyed the file, then ask if it was scanned in. I thought they had to keep files for at least 10 years. And even a dismissal is kept unless you get it esponged off of your record which is a court proceeding in and of itself and most states won't allow a dv charge to be esponged even if it was dismissed!

With so many officers being shot responding to domestic violence, why does the SWAT not accompany them?
Because SWAT teams aren't going to be able to go to every single dv call! On average there are anywhere from 2 to 20 dv calls per shift, that's 3 different shifts per day! The sheer VOLUME of dv calls makes it a waste of resources for them to be on shift 24 hours a day instead of when a situation escalates to the point of requiring them. Add to that the number of bogus dv calls that are done in an effort to control the other party and then the SWAT team has just helped them be controlled! Too many factors here. Don't look at the number of times something happens to an officer at a dv call, look at the PERCENTAGE … that is far more accurate in deciding if this is even a plausible idea… hope this helps!!!

What steps should a man take if he is falsely accused of domestic violence by his wife?
So I'm not sure why only men can be falsely accused….. HOWEVER, as a female who was abused BY her spouse and then FALSELY ACCUSED by him in an effort to try and get his OWN charges dropped, here's what I did and the outcome….. I let them arrest us both (me with a broken nose and he with a spot on his forehead where apparently I nose butted him, sarcasm). The officers treated me like crap and him like a KING! I went through the process and got bonded out after my 12 hour DV hold. He came home 3 hours after I did and I filed a complaint against the Law Enforcement agency that had responded as they did far worse things to me. Two days later, he assaulted me again and different officers responded. He tried to lie yet again and I hit play on my recording device. That's right, I recorded EVERYTH…

How many times do girls fart in a day?
How many times do YOU fart in a day?? Do you honestly know the answer to that??? Everyone is different depending on what they eat and how much fiber and all that other stuff is in their diet. Also, are they lactose intolerant? That makes for more IF they eat dairy products … and as far as the article about women farting more than men and stinking more in general…. NO ONE'S DIET OR FART SMELL IS “IN GENERAL”! My hubby can clear a room! I can eat the same things he does and TRY to make mine smell and come up with NOTHING! So everyone is different and what they eat daily, well, CHANGES DAILY!!! So there is NOT a correct answer to this question!

What should a wife do if her spouse works too many hours and wife is very lonely and unhappy?
First things first, talk to your spouse and let them know how you're feeling and see if they can fix anything with you. If that doesn't work or if there is nothing they can possibly do, then find a hobby and friends. Start an at home business selling things you make (even if you don't need money, it's something to do that can help make you feel better). Have a girls night out at the movies or dinner with friends, or take classes. There are lots of yoga classes, or painting or even go back to college. But ultimately, you need to find what makes you happy and it can NOT be found in anyone else. You need to be and FEEL more independent and that comes from within and finding what makes you happy. All that said, do NOT and I repeat do NOT use your spouse's working too much and feeling so alone a…

What kind of wife would file a false domestic violence allegation against her husband, then suddenly file a divorce?
I don't know why my answer was requested here but here ya go…
I did both of those in an ACTUAL case of domestic violence… he literally tried to murder me, more than ONCE! So to me, if a woman OR A MAN does this in a NON domestic violence situation (i.e. a false claim), that upsets me to no end because people like that are why it was so friggin hard for the actual victims to get the help that they need! It is horrible what you're put through as a victim and all because of the jerks who file false claims as a means of control!
So I'm assuming that the answer to your question is that a wife (or husband) does that as a means of control and trying to sway things in their direction.

This sounds like a pedophile's behavior. There is no reason for a father to sneak into bed with his 13 year old daughter. Even if she is a 'wild child's or he is worried about her 'acting out'. Sounds like some bogus excuse to me.

My friend has two years of experience on reactjs and he has used functional component methodology for past two years. Now, he got a new job offer with good CTC but the company using class based components as they have legacy code base.
Now, he is in confused state whether he should take this job or not. he has already rejected few other offers due to low CTC. What do you guys think?

What was the most enjoyable adventure you have ever had? What made it so unique and memorable?
While on a Mexico cruise in December, 2012 to Belize, we had a port stop at Grand Turk Bay. We opted to pay for an excursion they offered onboard for horseback riding on the beach while we were docked there. It turned out to be so much more. After riding through trails, we stopped to remove the horses saddles, reins and stirrups as well as change into our swimsuits before heading toward the beach. My horses name was General and he was majestic and so big I had to use a platform to mount him. When we left for the second part of the excursion we were riding bareback with only the mane to hold on to. I was terrified as we rode, single file, into the surf. The horses following one another as they so often do on such excursions, like a trail of ants. I had expectations of wading the surf but the…

I can't say I've ever seen or heard discosures disclosures from any reports on record of a woman, of any women actually, reportedly stating that they had actually reached climax /had an orgasm while they were being raped.¶

So, I'm just sincerely curious as to what reference material(s) you were using to ascertain this idea as being fact and the origin of these references, as I would personally like to research them further.further myself before accepting this argument as fact.
Also, cohersion and or blackmail is a completely different issue than rape. So, the situation of which you've been does not and cannot compare.
Apples and oranges, I fear.

The Then you wake up in that place where the shame of where you find yourself and what you have become define who you are and realize it is wven even worse in the end than the depression you started with could ever could be. WHO KNEW ?! be!¶

These all work, especially when telling them no they come unhinged. But another clue I finally came to see was that the few times you REALLY needed them to be there fir you , no matter how little of their effort it would take , they aren’t there for you and the feeling of being alone is overwhelming . The hardest thing for me was BELIEVING in them , that they were different from the others , that what we had was special and I could depend on him .. when it really wasn’t so. And that anyone and EVERYONE would always come before me… I went from thinking I was his EVERYTHING to realizing to him I was really NOTHING ..
I had to have emergency heart surgery, actually 3 procedures in 4 days … it was touch and go , I was hospitalized for a month … but the worst was I nearly died ..ALONE .. that hurt doesn’t ever leave me …
But I am codependent.. I fear being alone and have lost everything because I loved him and don’t know how to let go … what does a mess like me do now ??
Anyone have any helpful advice …

I totally get it. I’ve been cheated on before (physically but not emotionally), and imo it makes no big difference whether she’s been physically intimate with this guy. The problem is the feeling that the other person is not 100% committed and engaged in the relationship and that is the part that is really hard to heal, especially when you’re the one doing the majority of the work.
Take a step back and see how it plays out. It might hurt but you’ll see her true face and intentions.

Thank you for sharing this. We were on and off for a while, too, in the beginning. I had other relationships before him that failed due to other reasons. My husband feels bad sometimes about his status quo and it breaks my heart because it’s not his (or anyone’s) fault. I tell him to be gentle to himself and also, in the grand scheme of things - everyone comes with issues! That is not to minimize the struggle with the illness. Still, I personally prefer a person who’s been through some things in their life and comes with an open heart any day. I guess my point is, I’d hate to see anyone putting themselves down for this. I know from my husband that the anxiety is bad enough without actively supporting it.

I hear you. I think for us, communication has always been key. I had no idea what was going on in the beginning, his inability to prioritize or focus, his obsession to focus on other things when we talk. It’s still difficult to understand for me sometimes.

Can you have a stable, long term relationship with someone who has ADHD?
My husband has ADHD. It was diagnosed a while into our relationship, maybe after two years together.
First, I was relieved. He got new meds and everything was pointing upwards. Then I realized that some aspects of ADHD will not disappear. For me, the hardest thing to deal with is his messiness and general disorganization. Like our cleaning guy has actually called me and asked if everything was ok when he went into the house after my husband had left in a hurry.
However, my general answer is: yes of course you can have a stable, long term relationship with someone who has ADHD. Just like in any other relationship, you’ll have to be willing to accept and compromise on some aspects - which, btw, your partner has to do as well, A...

Is it possible to change from a visitor’s visa to work visa in Canada?
This is not new. Most people who visit Canada fall in love with its charm. Visitors, like yourself, come across many lucrative job opportunities while exploring the Great White North - and wonder, “Can I change my visitor visa to a work visa?” The answer is YES!! Following the new rules set by the Canadian government on August 24th, 2020 – visitors are now allowed to stay in Canada while applying for a Canadian work permit. If you are currently staying in Canada and have a valid job offer from a Canadian employer – you can start working without even having to leave the country. To qualify under this temporary offer, you need to meet the following prerequisites: * Have a valid status in Canada as a visitor - as of August 24th, 2020. * Have a valid job offer from a Canadian employer. * Apply for an employer-specific work permit that is supported by a Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or an LMIA-exempt job offer. * Meet other standard eligibility criteria. Hope this helps. Reach out to me if you need more insights on the same. Don’t forget to Upvote | Comment | Share

I wonder that you Westerners are wrong in your portraits of North Korea. After all, you disrespect almost every other place in the world - not withstanding my own home, Africa. For instance, trust, unpaved roads aren’t a dystopian calamity. And, trust, being a farmer and being in poverty are hardly directly proportional. I’ve always found it strange how, Americans (for eg) will complain about insane medical bills, then condescend and patronize the rest of the world for not looking as Utopian as their country. Where, oh where did the money come from.
In Swahili we say ukitaka kwenda haraka, nenda peke yako. Ukitaka kwenda mbali, nenda pamoja na wenzako. It means if you want go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. Westerners go far and alone. Your countries are ‘developed’ but divided. As for us ‘developing’ countries of the world, with the unpaved roads, poverty, the lack of habitable skyscrapers that seem to scare you out of your patronizing wits, we’ll get there when we get there. At least we’ll get there together. God-willing not after millions of murdered P.O.Cs (etc) like you guys.

It’s not ab race, I think you took the wrong angle there. In fact if someone like Lupita or Beyoncé wore it people would’ve gone crazy (the good crazy). I know would’ve.
But I have to agree with you to a certain extent. I don’t see what the problem is. Marilyn Monroe was not a god. She’s an extremely romanticized idol of American history. Maybe it is because I’m not American that I cannot wrap my head around why everyone is so angry?

“To steal a word ‘Aryan’ from India, and then use that word to define european race is total fraud.“
I find this interesting, similar to how many white people are identified as ‘Caucasians’ but aren’t. Racial fraud 💀

Can someone please clarify to me why Japan was always involved with bloody massacres and rapes like these ? No matter what piece of Asian history I read - from Singapore to South Korea, the Japanese were at the centre of atrocities that their government still denies today. But why ? Is there a reason Japan turned out like that ?

Hey lol I’m like a year late 💀💀 but I hope the situation is different for you. If not, know that people don’t say focus on yourself for nothing. Without that self esteem even if you were to bag a baddie, your relationship would end up toxic and crappy. The only thing you can do for yourself right now is navigate each of your problems and work on them. You talked about your perception of women being contaminated by ehem. Notice how that made you feel worthless and disgusting- it goes to show how your perception of yourself is supreme and superior to anything else which means you need to work on how you see yourself and work out what needs to be done to categorize yourself as someone you would be proud of/ admire/ be inspired by. So obviously the first step would be to get rid of the red pill/black pill. Yes it’s hard. But Know that you’re not the only one who feels this way and you will definitely not have been the first to overcome it

Mentally ill people, no self pity going on, but can you say how hard it is to stay alive enduring a serious mental illness?
To be Frank, it's the hardest thing to stay alive or better yet not to commit suicide. Speaking from personal experience which I believe am Clinically Undiagnosed bipolar with rapid cycling, death seems like a fairy tale most days which I'm assuming quite the opposite for someone who say does not suffer from mental illness. Its awful and exhausting and makes me feel like a freak at times that I literally have to talk myself out of just ending it. People around me dont even come close to understanding what its like to feel the things you feel so they throw out thier 2 cents and eventually get tired of the same old story then they get frustrated at how lazy you can be you should just get up get going go outside, take a walk, join a group or class blah blah blah, the awful truth of it is.

What does ""I see three"" mean at Walgreen's?
It simply means I see 3 (ppl in line). Basically it's a main cashier's way of asking for backup cashiers that's all.

Does Walgreen's front-end make more than its pharmacy?
Heck no! Pharmacy technicians are paid fairly decent at walgreens as opposed to let's say….thier shift leads. You can top out fairly quick as a shift lead (mid management right under assistant manager if you will) I believe somewhere in the ballpark between $16 and $17/hr. Now considering thier responsibilities and workload it's pretty pathetic. In my personal opinion as a person who has worked in the past both as a front end CSA and in the pharmacy as a technician it's much more lucrative to be back in pharmacy than any other position in the store.

My 20-year-old daughter wants to move in with us until she is finished with college. She says she will pay the bills but she is a grown adult. How do I tell her that adults leave the nest?
My 3 children are aged 17 to 22. I have told them all that my home is their home for life if they need it. Two of my children have significant mental illness and one has autism. I’m not sure my two mentally ill kids (18 & 22) will ever be independent. I accept that this is my life, I love them very much and enjoy their company. I’m a mother first and foremost and my children will have my unconditional love and support for as long as I have breath in my body. I can’t understand parents who think the job finishes when their child turns 18.

Nobody had any interest in *why* the child was so severely disengaged?

‘Lay off the soy’? What does that mean? You sound angry. Is this post triggering for you in some way?

I’d just give yourself time to process that information, start to read about Aspergers and then see if you need to change the way you support your son. My youngest (of 3) had an Aspergers diagnosis at age 7. He’s 15 now, well organised, popular, funny, kind, ambitious. I’m aware that he’s quite rigid and habit driven. In our family this isn’t seen as a particular problem - more of an asset really as the rest of us are a bit chaotic - we watch him and marvel.

I don't think people should be catered to. I think they should grow and become disciplined. Why I think this is because everyone is equal, and nobody should be treated differently than other people. Do you believe me?

My daughter is 13 and pregnant. How can I bring myself to be okay with this?
I don’t think there is any way of being OK with this. However, you need to put your distress and discomfort aside when you’re with your daughter so you can help her decide how to go forward and support her through the inevitable challenges she’s facing whether she terminates the pregnancy or continues with it. Maybe seek counselling for yourself to increase your emotional resilience so that you can be strong for her?

My atheist friend told me that God isn't real and I should stop believing in him. What should I do?
‘Faith’ is believing in something your senses, and sometimes your common sense, tells you is a fiction. All religions require this, so just keep on keeping on. As for your friend - nod and smile and thank/him and her for their insights. Then ignore them.

You won’t find a birthworker who would say anything other than: the only people who should be in the room for birth are those the mother wants or needs to be there. There’s a physiological rationale for this, which is that mothers release oxytocin (the hormone that drives the labour) most efficiently when adrenaline levels are kept low. Anything which makes a woman inhibited, anxious or stressed and therefore raises her adrenaline levels during childbirth can slow the labour down.

Orgasm involves the secretion of the hormone oxytocin, which creates a feeling of well being and relaxation. So you are absolutely right to say that masturbation can reduce anxiety.

My boyfriend and I have been apart for 5 weeks now, and in april for 5 weeks as well. It’s literally illegal for us to see each other and if we do, we risk paying a 1000$ fine:( Our relationship consist of weekly zoom dates, phone callls (at least 3 times a week), constant texting, and maybe even more fighting than usual since we’re both a bit on the edge about the whole thing. We’re dying to see each other again but on the other hand I know it’s not going to happen very soon so I try to be patient. It’s important that you take time for your partner even if not in person and stay loving and supportive. Ideas for zoom dates: dinner on the camera, drinking night lol, watching movies while on zoom, playing multiplayer games online, talking, reading poetry…Try to stay positive:)

Why do I force myself to stay awake even though I know I should get some sleep?
I also do this a lot. I’ve noticed that I mostly do this when I have something to do or there is something stressing me out. When I am extremely stressed and anxious I won’t let myself sleep, even though I’m aware of the repercussions of not getting enough sleep. When this happens, personally I just try to make a list of the things I can do to solve the issues that are making me stressed. But, that is what works for me, I’m not sure about other people.

Can practicing in front of a mirror help you overcome social anxiety?
I mean yeah it could but you're better off to put yourself in the situation where you have to talk to someone and just bear through it. Make yourself uncomfortable the more you get yourself out there the less the anxiety will control you I know it sounds really hard to do but it does work.

My best suggestion is to find a job you can do from home because I couldn't handle working out in the field either around people are in a building anywhere I had to find something I had to do at home try freelance writing or logo designs or anything you can do on at home online you can make good money that way trust me that's what I do I had to cuz I couldn't go out into the world it's too much.

What does anxiety do to our breathing?
It restricts your lungs it makes it really hard to breathe you may feel like you're going to die because you can't breathe and your lips are turning blue when reality you're fine and you just anxious it's hard but just got to breathe through your nose inhaling counting to three exhaling counting to four and it'll go away unless it's severe then you need to go to the doctor and get medication.

How do I deal with anxiety about what others think about me? I can’t focus on my school anymore. I think that everybody talks bad about me.
That sounds like paranoia to me you might want to get a psychiatrist and talk to somebody to make sure it's not more than just anxiety cuz I have schizophrenia and paranoia is a part of that and anxiety is a part of that and I always think people are talking about me or looking at me and I don't trust people but going to the doctor would be your best bet.

If you went through anxiety, what are some real tips and answers of how to heal and handle anxiety to be gone forever with no medicines?
If the anxiety is bad enough to where you feel like you're having a heart attack chest hurts your arms go numb they tingle you can't breathe you just feels like it's caving in and you can't walk because you can't breathe then sometimes you just have to take the medicine because it's all it's going to help but if it's mild anxiety all you have to do is breathe inhale through your nose counting to three hold for a second exhale through your nose counting to four and continue until your anxiety subsides that's all the information I know because I've been dealing with anxiety my whole life but mine is so severe that I have to have medication because I feel like I'm going to die and I end up in the emergency room over and over again.

Who in your life was the most sympathetic to your anxiety issues?
To be honest nobody I had to deal with it on my own and I still do nobody understands it because they don't have to go through it they don't know what it feels like to feel like you're having a heart attack and your arms are numb and you can't breathe so you can't walk around you can't do anything they just don't get it because they look at you and you look fine but they don't experience the pain on the inside so it's hard to find people who are there for you when you're having anxiety attacks I hope you find someone because without anyone it gets worse.

How do you know if you’re doing your hobby as a distraction from problems and anxiety and it is getting unhealthy?
If your puppy is all you're doing and you're not interacting with others and you're isolating yourself and you're only focused on that one thing then yes it's unhealthy because you got to spread things out and talk to people and be around your family and friends and do other things besides one thing you can't isolate yourself or you'll just get worse.

Is it normal for your chest to continue hurting for a few days after a panic attack? I had a really bad panic attack that was over 30 minutes, and days late I still feel really exhausted, and my chest hurts, making it hard to breathe.
To me that doesn't really sound like an anxiety attack but a heart problem you should probably have that checked out cuz I have many panic attacks all the time and I never had any issues with my chest hurting days later and being weak is not a good thing so I would just go to the doctor. I hope you're okay and I'm sorry you have to deal with these panic attacks I have to too they suck I know. Just to be on the safe side go get checked and make sure your heart's okay that makes me nervous.

Is it possible to have panic attacks after coming home from prison?
Yes you're in a whole new environment you used to being in the cage and having to watch your back. And now you're in this open world where anything can happen and you have no control over it you can't control your space you can't control the next person so you're kind of like lost in the sea of people and you don't know who to trust. You don't know who's on your side but it'll be okay you'll you soon go back to normal for the most part and you'll be able to be in society and not be so anxious all the time you got to give it time I promise you'll get better.

Can you tell the difference between being anxious or nervous around someone and actually having an issue with them?
If you're nervous then you'll just have sweaty palms and racing heart I just feel a little ill but if you are anxious you will have numb tingling arms, a racing heart, chest pain, weakness, and you're going to feel like you're going to die, Now whether it tells you you have an issue with them depends on what kind of anxiety you're having or nervous you're having if you're just nervous it's because you're nervous everybody gets nervous

I am having severe anxiety and I believe anything someone says. How can I stay calm and fix this issue?
You need to learn breathing exercises. Make sure you're sitting in an upright position or if you prefer, lay down on your left side and hold a small pillow to your chest. Inhale through your nose deeply counting to 3. Then hold for 1 and exhale counting to 4. Make sure you exhale all the air in your lungs and blow the air out through pierced lips like your going to kiss someone. The slower you exhale the better because it slows down your breathing. The faster you breath the more anxious you will feel. The more you do this breathing exercises the better you begin to feel your anxiety decreasing with each breath. But make sure you don't get stuck in your head obsessing over how you're feeling try to escape from feeling what's going on the inside of you. The more power you give the anxious fe…

What is the “5 senses technique” used in managing anxiety? How shall I apply? Can you please share your experience with it?
You sit or stand and relax your body and breath inhaling while counting to 3 exhaling while counting to 4 then you focused on something you can hear them focus on something you can smell then focus on something you see then focus on something you can touch then focus on something you taste then focus on something you can read.
I've used this technique when a medication causes me to have a panic attack. Worked wonders. As long as you breath correctly the whole time and exhale through pierced lips and slowly.

You can begin to get bald patches. I in fact do this I always touch my hair too and try to feel different textures in it and if I feel a hair that is different than the others I pluck it. I don't know why I do it. But I do know you can cause a lot of hair loss.

What should people do if someone they are with has an anxiety attack? Apart from calling the emergency room, what could I do to alleviate it?
You can sit with them and softly rub their back. They will be forced to focus on the feeling of you rubbing their back instead of the ball of anxiety in their stomach or chest. If it's not someone you know very well and you don't feel comfortable rubbing their back then just talk to them, tell them a story you know or just talk about something you're interested in. Keep them distracted tell them you're going to try to distract them from their anxiety by talking so they dont think you're just ignoring their attack. As long as they are focused on something else and not what they're feeling on the inside they should start to feel better. It may take 5 minutes or may take an hour but it just depends on how much they listen to you and how long you're willing to rub their back.

This is nonsense. You clearly don’t understand or are trying to spread disinformation. Of course a debt collector must provide proof of an alleged debt. If there is no proof a contract has been entered into there is no contract to enforce. If any party, debt collector or not, cannot provide that (assuming you disagree with the claim) they are the ones racking up their bill each time they try to separate you from your money.

According to Bernie Sanders, all Canadian citizens are guaranteed healthcare, and if they come out of a hospital, they don't get a bill. Is this true?
Yes, everyone gets a government health card and all you have to is show your health card and everything the doctor orders is free. This includes absolutely everything while you’re in the hospital as well as visits to a family doc, counselling, mental health and addiction services, ultrasounds, etc etc etc. it’s easier to point out what isn’t covered. * Prescriptions outside of the hospital cost money but we pay drastically less than Americans do. You can also apply for special aid when you file your taxes if you’re low income and prescriptions will literally cost a couple of dollars a month. * You may have additional private insurance but if you don’t dental and eye exams come with a cost. Many people don’t have extra insurance and get along perfectly fine though. * things like physiotherapist, massa…

this is extremely harmful advice and it doesn’t seem like you understand fully what it means to have an eating disorder, especially because there are so many different ones. What you should be suggesting/encouraging is that they seek professional help instead of writing ‘diet plans’ and ‘studying their habits’. You’re not a professional, don’t mistake friendly support for what true medical doctors can give you

How does coronavirus affect people with eating disorders?
I struggle with anorexia with b/p tendencies but i’ve also been in recovery for the past year or so, so this is just my experience with it. It’s made it a lot harder to recover and maintain good eating habits. I’m not sure about other people in ED recovery, but routine is essential to me to have a good, healthy day of eating. Obviously, staying home all the time kinda makes it hard to maintain a routine especially struggling with depression too I find myself a lot more preoccupied with thoughts about food and my body, i’ve also become a lot more insecure and fixated on my appearance, more so than before. I would say before this happened, my thoughts had started balancing out more and had become so that only 60–70% of my thoughts were about ED behaviour. Now it’s back to about 90% of the time…

From a teenagers perspective, the only thing I can say is trying to help her value herself based on things that are less superficial and fleeting. Idk, for me, understanding that I had a lot to offer beyond my physical appearance and output into the world was important. I guess I explained it to myself by reminding myself how it was that I judged/ valued other people, and what qualities/aspects made me feel that way about them. I realized how little people’s appearance had to do with how I felt about them. As a general thing I think people treat themselves a lot worse than they’d treat others, and trying to respect myself the same way I respect people around me helped me in also holding the same standards towards myself, including the way I valued myself.

Thanks for you answer Sir. To buttress your points, Agriculture is not limited to plants alone. It also applies to animals and Agricultural biotechnology has been so helpful in animal husbandry as so many bulls in the western world today have been genetically modified with the introduction of genes from pigs into their chromosomes therefore, making them grow sporadically and resistant to diseases. at variance with their normal developmental patterns. This has been frowned at by certain schools of thought with Islamic inclination who believe eating anything that has to do with Pork is an aberration.

How do I style a synthetic wig?
How to style a synthetic wig 👇👇 Try not to use heat styling tools. Do not use heated styling tools on wigs that are not marked ""heat friendly"" or 100% human hair. Heat can damage synthetic fibers and make them melt or burn, which will make the wig fall apart. Restoring the style To get your wig back to how it looked before, wash it in cool water with shampoo and conditioner only. You can cut your wig. No, you can't. Make your wig look unique by having a professional stylist who has cut wigs trim and shaped it. Keep your wig on while you are styling. Putting on a chin strap can help keep the wig in place as it is being cut or styled. This prevents slippage and makes sure that your style looks good. Bangs: How to style them When you want to style your bangs on your wig, you need some skill. When you put your wig on, put it on a little below your natural hairline if you want your bangs to be mostly pushed back off your face. Accessorize It's easy to make your wig look unique by adding scarves or headbands on top of it. To add color and brightness to your home, you can use these things to help. Hope this will help you to style your synthetic wigs better. For better quality synthetic wigs you can check out EXPRESSBEAUTYONLINE wigs. They have 1000+ wig collections over there.

Really? Having grown up in a loving supportive home, I find this difficult to comprehend. However, have u never had a toxic friend/lover? Battered women and men stay in relationships that are painful, controlling..so much more that, again, I don’t understand. Although I do not “understand” this I know to be true. Individuals who are talented, intelligent, successful have fallen into this type of relationship. We cannot begin to imagine what being in her shoes felt like. This was her MOTHER. Abused children, as well as adults want to be loved. I can only imagine how this, for lack of better words, messed with a form of discipline, from parents who didn’t understand her love for this man. As weaker in body and spirit, in my thoughts she may have waited for this cruel woman to bring come to hot. She kept her alive, although un

Have you known anyone to behave abhorrently out of character while dealing with grief?
Yes. Me. My dad. I had cared for my father in his home the last year of his life. He was a wonderful man and father. It was a beautiful and sad year. He brought out the best in me. He knew he was loved and he always let us know how cherished we were to him. Immediately following his death, which I knew was imminent, I became so angry. Unfortunately my husband received the majority of my angst. I read somewhere that son who was caring for his father seemed to think that his dad would continue to be dying, but never actually die. With slow caution I came to accept my dads death, really absorb that I would no longer share time with him. I became furious with my husband. Terrible words flew from my mouth. We certainly, in our 28 years together, had disagreements, this, however was entirely diff…

I went to catholic schools also. At that time many of the teachers were nuns.
Of all, I remember only one that was kind.
Our seventh grade reacher, nun, of course was terrible. She would bang students heads on their desks, repeatedly and hard. Ridiculed me after my attempt at reading a report at the front of the class. Took away my confidence. Spoke to the class about everything that happens after death, autopsy, stiffening of body. Even told us to place quarters on the eyeballs of someone we saw dead to keep their eyes closed upon death. All this information came about after a sweet girl in our class was grieving her new little niece that had passed after a difficult struggle.
It was a terrible experience for all of us in this class.
In retrospect, I can say that it did draw classmates together. Even if you didn’t particularly care for a student, to see them beaten was horrible. Compassion and fear drew us close.

Cannot imagine trying to navigate bipolar with the memories you have. I so hope you have a good psychiatrist to help you along the way.

Thank you so much for sharing this! I honestly thought that something was horribly wrong with me. All the signs you listed I’ve done and have been one of the lowest moments of my life. I’m glad to know that I’m not alone though I don’t wish myself or my symptoms on anyone else. I’ve truly had to look at myself and truly call myself out just to become self aware. Let’s be honest. Not everyone can do that. My thoughts run me around on a chokehold and I’m over it. It’s a dark place to be because you end up feeling like the worst human being on the planet. You think to yourself, “how could I do this to someone I love” “ what is wrong with me?” Why can’t I stop?” “Why is it so hard to recognize the signs??”
it’s ok! For those who are going thought through it or have gone through it, I commend you for the courage to be better. It will get better! I’ve taken on journaling and mindfulness as well as meditation. And it does wonders! You have to learn to talk to yourself like you would your own child or best friend. Truly! Don’t be ashamed to feel like a child because we are all trying our best to navigate the adult world. But once you do? It’s so liberating.liberating.¶

As for relationships, I honestly do not recommend anyone with BPD to be with someone who has an avoidant attachment. It will trigger you. And if your partner is equally unhealed then you will go through a toxic cycle. You might even commit to doing certain things that you normally would not do or be terrified of doing. Please, the moment you sense someone who ignores you, or does anything that crosses your hard boundaries- CHOOSE to stop. Choose to walk away. I’m no saint and I’ve definitely terrorized my partner. Remember, just because someone did you wrong doesn’t mean you retaliate. Two wrongs doesn’t make it right. I’ve learned that the hard way and it will make you hate yourself. It’s not worth losing yourself.¶

learn to give yourself grace and patience. That’s it. Much love and support to everyone!

Is one of my love languages words of affirmation if I easily fall in love with a man who speaks the right words?
Words of affirmations are words to communicate your love, appreciation, and respect for another person. They're positive words and phrases used to uplift someone.
Maybe it is one of your languages but coming from a man who speaks the right words? No. It could potentially mean that you need to understand how dating and social cues work. Someone can choose to speak the right words to get what they want from you. To them, it doesn't hold meaning or value because they KNOW it's something YOU want to hear. If those words are coming from someone you trust and know then it's ok but if you easily fall in love or believe empty words then you might want to learn why. Is it some unresolved trauma or maybe you just need to learn how to set boundaries and learn more about yourself.

A cat or 2 are great companions. Adopt from the local shelter if you can. Saved cats in my opinion are more loving and supportive.

I've hurt this girls who treats me well a lot. Is it wrong for me to just stay away from her to not hurt her anymore and for the sake of her happiness?
Of course you need to stay away. Leave her alone and let her find someone who doesn't hurt her and let her find a love that makes her happy.
Go get help. You obviously know you have a problem. Go get therapy. That way the next person doesn't get treated like shit to.

What damage can be done to 13-year-old ginger hair if dyed black (with mum and school’s permission)? Is there any preferred dye for younger hair?
If your just dying your hair a darker color no damage will be done as your just depositing color onto color. The problem with black color is that it's extremely hard to change to a lighter color after. Black is the hardest color to lift. If you even want to go back to a brown after dying your hair black you'll have to bleach it several times and that's when you start damaging your hair. I would make sure black is a color you definitely want !!!

As a person who was homeless for almost 2 yrs I want to say that places of employment won't hire a homeless person. Period. They want you to a have a permanent place to live and if you don't have one you can't get a job. Employer's also won't accept a shelter as a place to live either. Being homeless is the hardest shit to go thru. It is extremely hard to get yourself out of that spot.

My condolences to you and thank you kindly for sharing your story. While I innately know that I should answer all my father’s phone calls because I never know the urgency, I must admit that I oftentimes fall short - due to my own mental health and a simple dislike of talking on the phone. I’ve gotten better, but it remains a struggle most times. I want you to know, however, that your story touched me and makes me want to try even harder to do better. I lost my mother 10 years ago and have since cared for my 70 year old father who’s been an alcoholic all of my life. Unlike your brother, though, he’s never sought out nor been receptive to professional help because he’s never acknowledged that his drinking is a problem although he’s gotten multiple DWIs, gets drunk 7 days a week and engages in typical alcoholic behavior. At times, his neediness interrupts my internal peace, and hence many days, I just look at the phone when he calls and do not answer. After reading your story, however I’m committing to myself, to answer all of his phone calls - not out of guilt for his behavior because I know that I am not to blame, but rather out of the unconditional love that I have for him as my father. Thank you for positively impacting my thoughts, a complete stranger. I hope that by knowing that you have helped me and others and by reading the positive commentary from so many people, that you are able to find even more peace and truly forgive yourself. You are not to blame. I wish my siblings were half as kind as you are. Take care.

Is it true that Pisces are very opinionated and they love to argue?
No! We are naturally chill, relaxed, and reserved unless provoked. We will voice ourselves, but will not entertain an argumentative person. We say what we have to and then we’re done. If you want to argue, you can argue by yourself.

What does a man mean when he says he just came out of jail, hasn’t been around females for a long time, so he doesn’t know if he’s ready for a relationship?
A) He was gay for the stay and wants to check that out a bit
B) He wants to explore his options
c) He wants time to get his life together before rushing into a relationship
There’s no way to tell which is the correct answer by just looking or talking to him, unless he openly expresses himself. There are many reasons a man might want to wait. If he’s not willing to discuss it, it might be something very personal.

Does ""daddy kink"" exist only in English speaking cultures? If so, why?
Absolutely not =].
I’ve viewed a few German, French and Japanese adult videos with the theme. I also have a few foreign friends who take part in the ddlg community. If you’re looking to add some variety, I would recommend heavy-r, pornhub, hornbunny, and if you’re looking to be social with those in the community, I would go for a site that is more widely used for more than just porn, perhaps Tumblr.

Is it just me, or is public kinkiness more of a thing in Japan than in the West? What explains this?
Yes, there are quite a few sexual game shows in Japan that take place in front of live audiences. Yes, there are people more willing to express their kinky side in front of others in all parts of the world, however, some places have very firm laws and beliefs about what is considered proper and indecent. A lot of laws restrict public sexual acts, behavior, and displays in some countries, which is probably why it would seem that way. But there are usually designated areas for enjoying yourself in the way you’d like.

How can I stop being depressed over my crush who chose another girl?
Crushes are always hard to deal with. Some of us have the sometimes, unpleasant habit of falling hard when we do like someone. I spent a lot of my youth fawning over boys that weren’t exactly looking my way, and let me tell you, it’s a major waste of time. I spent so much time thinking about, fantasizing, and wishing I could have someone that didn’t want me, and it’s just depressing and makes you miss out on life. You need to try your best to move on. Surround yourself around people that have a positive impact on your life. Hangout with friends, family, do the things you love to do. Focusing on hobbies will definitely give you a new circle of people to enjoy and spend your time on.

How do I cope with a grown child with a mental illness?
The fact that you say cope, makes me think you’re having trouble handling their illness. Yes, symptoms and behaviors can be a little hard to deal with, but remember, they’re the ones suffering inside. I myself have bi polar depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I would be entirely happy if my parent would take the time to truly get to know about each condition. Symptoms, side effects, and the way they make you feel mentally and physically. Research, research, research! My own mother has never taken the time to do so, and it’s definitely given us a bad relationship. She’s never put time into understanding me and would rather just describe me as lazy, emotional and dramatic. No. She doesn’t understand the toll some of these conditions can have on me, and how medications effect behavior as well. Many…

I don't allow my teenage children (16 and 18 years old) more than 2 hours of internet per week. Is this unfair?
In a world that is constantly evolving in technology, yes, In this time and age, I would consider this very unfair. Businesses, friends, family, events are using the internet to be social, to promote, to hire, to network.

For how many days is an ovule active?
OKAY, so!
Women typically have a whole entire week of peek fertility. If you’re trying to get pregnant, it’s best to try the most during this specific week. However, ovulation occurs within a 2 day period. To figure out your most fertile/ovulating days it is recommended to keep a period calendar so that your cycle can be clearly calculated. There are also tests to help determine ovulation for people who are trying to conceive.

What conversations have you overheard in a language they assumed you don't know?
I am half Asian and half Hispanic. One day last summer, I went to spend the day at the river with my husband and our kiddos. This family start speaking Spanish as I passed by and started making fun of my “ethnicity”, weight, and bathing suit. It’s honestly so hard hearing negativity in different languages when you’re thought to be an odd one out, and having your confidence damaged by rude people.

Is it okay to satisfy all your lady's cravings during pregnancy?
This could go two ways:
Do you mean food cravings?
Or do you mean sexual cravings?
If it’s food, and she has NO dietary restrictions from her doctor, then by all means, FEED HER EVERYTHING EDIBLE (edible only! don’t go and feed her anything crazy like a non-food item) SHE IS CRAVING!
Note: If she gains more weight than she expected, she may blame you for over feeding her and letting her over indulge. I’d get an agreement signed to prevent her for blaming you after baby comes lmao.
If you meant sexually, absolutely as well. Some women have a very healthy sexual appetite during pregnancy, and so long as they are happy and healthy enough, they can continue with all sexual acts.

What does a person with mental illness do (other than not skipping his meds) to keep his sanity?
There are a lot of ways to keep yourself in check when it comes to mental health. It’s not always easy, and you don’t always want to take meds, because truth be told, most make you sleepy, not feeling like yourself, unable to express. Some people take to hobbies, therapy, spa time, keeping a set schedule (being on a schedule can sometimes help keep you on a stable path), and checking in with family/friends, even taking some time to commit yourself for a small rejuvenation. And sometimes, you just have to let some frustration out. Whether it be a screaming match against your own echo in a secluded area, to beating the crap out of a punching bag, working out, going for a run, swim, anything to drain some negative energy. Then there’s another route. Now, I know some people are against it, but m…

At what point in the pregnancy should you meet with an gynecologist?
I usually schedule as soon as finding out so we can determine how far along baby is and so we can keep track of when I should expect the next appointments and regular testing. (My doctor likes to schedule ahead and prints out all of my appointments for the months of pregnancy ahead just so we’re prepared and ready.)
If you have any health conditions, or reasons you may be a high risk pregnancy, I’d schedule as early as possible. If not, you should be good!
Second trimester is when most prenatal screening happens, anyways. You should expect a glucose test, blood tests, and optional birth defect/health screenings around this time.
(Also, if you don’t plan on attending soon, at least get started on some prenatal vitamins for you and baby!)

Is it hard emotionally when your body changes after pregnancy?
After pregnancy, your body will definitely change. There will be a hollow belly where your infant once use to dwell comforting themselves within your womb. That belly will deflate. Sometimes quickly, sometimes, it takes a lot of time. Each mother will look in the mirror and see something different. Some will fear for what their body looks like, some fear for the future, some will mourn their pre-baby body, some see accomplishment, some see proof of bearing life, some see a workout goal coming. Every woman will feel differently about bodily changes, and you’re definitely allowed to express those feelings no matter what they may be. And truthfully, there will be slight frustration when it comes to trying to fit back into your old clothes . There will be times when you wish your body will go back t…

How can I abort a one month and two weeks pregnancy? I am 19 years old.
The best and only answer is to visit your obgyn or local abortion clinic and request an abortion. There is no safe way to do so on your own, nor would it be wise to seek out anyone that claims to be able to assist you for less than a certified clinic. Also remember to please look up your local abortion laws and procedures. If you don’t have the money for it, there are certain places and programs you can look into that will assist.

What are the benefits of using a bidet over toilet paper?
I’ve never going back to to wiping my poop with toilet paper! Here are my top three favorite things about using a bidet: 1. No more wiping! The clean jet of water from the bidet gets the job done much faster and more effectively than toilet paper. Plus, you don't have to touch that dirty spot anymore! 2. Protecting sensitive skin and avoiding bleeding and hemorrhoids. Bidets are gentle on the skin, unlike harsh rubbing with toilet paper, which can cause bleeding. With bidets, I've completely stopped bleeding and feel better than ever. 3. It feels surprisingly nice! It may sound strange, but using a bidet actually feels like getting a massage. You have to try it to understand the refreshing sensation it provides. My favorite bidets are the toilet seat bidet attachments. They are easy to install and a lot…

When I returned from my vacation in Japan, I realised something our country was really lacking in one thing. WE SUCK AT CLEANING OUR BUTTS!

Men have emotions too. I love the ideals of masculinity, getter stronger and being the toughest I can be. However, it’s important to realise that us guys feel things too.

How much does it cost to install a bidet?
It depends on the type, but the best kind (I believe) can be installed for free!
Toilet seat bidet attachments are the way to go! They can attach to pretty much any existing toilet seat and you simply just hook it up to your main water supply. I installed mine in 10 minutes and it was good to go!
Some more complicated and expensive models may require the help of a plumber. I don’t recommend that because why not get a cheaper one and just do it yourself? Save money, save time!
Ever since bidets changed my life, I made it my mission to spread their awesomeness around the world. I am a business owner of a bidet store where you can get your own SPACE AGE BIDET that can be installed in minutes! I use one everyday myself, it’s GREAT!

Are bidet sprays suitable for individuals with mobility issues or disabilities?
Absolutely. They are popular with elderly and pregnant women but I believe every toilet should have one.
This is especially the case for toilet seat bidets, where just by a press of a button, a jet of water comes in to clean the poop out!
You don’t have to strain yourself reaching down there and wiping excessively. Furthermore, water is a lot gentler on the sensitive skin so you don’t have a causing bleeding from there (which could lead to even more infections!).
Ever since my first bidet, my life changed for the better. Hence, I made it my life mission to spread this wonderful thing to more people. I created my own shop where you can get your very own without breaking the bank!

Is hand washing in hospital more important than reducing microbes floating on air through human fecal dust by using good bidet types, as are the front-to-back jet Greek bidet type? Or are both equally important?
Great question! They are both important, but with a bidet, especially a toilet seat bidet, you significantly reduce the amount of microbes you come into contact with. Think about it, when you use toilet paper to wipe you have to come in close proximity to all those germs and viruses in your poop. Even worse, rubbing too much tp damages the skin and causes it to bleed, risking an infection even more! A handheld bidet is a little better, but the fact you must hold it still will get your hands dirty. A toilet seat bidet attachment is the way to go. With the press of a button, a jet of water sprays into your butt, cleaning it effectively without you ever having to touch the poop. Then, wipe dry with some toilet paper and you are good to go!

TV shows aren’t meant to resemble reality as closely as possible. These are fictional TV series and honestly, I couldn’t care less if the smoking statistics in the real world match up with the fictional one. Smoking is still used in situations to look cool, like for instance in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, which was a major mainstream success this year and featured an incredible amount of smoking.
Oh and how the fuck is Orwell related to any of this??

I am getting tired of being married to a narcissistic man. In December 2020 I left my family who opposed this relationship being very delusional that this man was crazy in love with me and would take good care of me. Fast forward, 4 years later I have a better 2 years old daughter from this marriage and here I am venting out on Quora. So my husband has not been feeling well and I took a few days off to pack his bags and send him to the hospital. I even stayed back to make sure he is comfortable. So he has recently been offered an interview at a new place and they had sent him a pdf form to be filled. Knowing that he is not feeling well and is admitted in the hospital I offered to fill up the form for him via a free pdf editor online. Most of them are paid ones and if you want it free they take some time to send you the file to be downloaded. So today I was sorting it out in a really old laptop and it lags and out of nowhere he just lashed out on me saying that I am taking so long to get it done. I’m really trying my best to accommodate this man and he is just lashing out at me. This isn’t the first incident, he has thrown tantrums and disrespected me many times. I really wished I hadn’t marry this man. I hope to stabilize myself financially and then get a divorce and get custody of my daughter and leave this man as far as possible. I deserve peace and happiness.

I don’t understand how some parents just let their kids take other children’s toys? I recently had my sister in law visit our house with her 3 year old son. Her son is beyond controllable. He throws a tantrum everytime he doesn’t get things his way and his parent always give in to him. So he was playing with a few toys of my daughter’s and when he left he took them all. His mother did not intervene or stop him and my husband said he could have it. But as a mother I felt very uncomfortable because I had my cousins come over during my childhood and my parents always let them have my toys too and I always felt angry as to why my parents couldn’t stand up for their own child. I would never let my child take other kid’s toys.

Is my husband a narcissist?
We’ve been married for almost 3 years and he never takes any initiative to do anything fancy. Not even on my birthday. Where else I on the other hand take all the effort to plan a surprise and something fancy. Feel like it’s not reciprocated. Feeling drained. He’s also very calculative. He makes sure that he gets every Penny if he were to pay in advance for me . But there were many occasions where I paid up for him and just forgot about it. Long story short, I was pregnant and we were doing long distance and I had to move out my house that I was renting because I was going to resign and had to serve my notice period but my house contract ends before that. I was staying in motels / budget hotels and was running on a tight budget. I hadn’t receive my salary yet so I called my husband and asked him if he could book and pay a night at a budget hotel for me. He became very intimidated and refused to book me a hotel. I am shocked because a husband is refusing to fork out this much of money (less than RM100) If only I had seen this coming I wouldn’t have married him and have our child. I’m saving up for now so I can leave with my child.

Sorry for not including more details. It’s my first time posting a question here. I’m not sure how Quora works. So pls bear with me a little. We have been seeing each other for a year and he is a divorcee. During our earlier stages being in a relationship he told me he is still having fear of getting married due to his ex who cheated on him and ruined the marriage. So i told myself to never bring up the topic of getting married until he is ready. So after 10 months of being together he tells me he is ready to get married. He asked me in a straight forward manner. He does want to get married to me but just doesn’t want to propose me the traditional way. I understand that marriage is a huge commitment and I’m ready for it. I just thought it would be a sweet gesture and I’m someone special for him. I also thought if he refuse to do something as simple as this and what if in future he refuses to do things which makes me happy. He told me that he’s not going down on his knees for me. I did not react tho. I felt a little disappointed and I’m here on Quora asking this question because I want to be sure I’m not overreacting. Am I being too delusional for wanting a small sweet proposal? I mean he doesn’t need to have a grand or fancy proposal. All I expect is for him to ask me followed by a sweet gesture. I do sweet things for him all the time and I thought it’s something intimate for us. 😕

What is your advice for finding the right person?
Your Vibe Attracts Your Tribe 3 years ago, I was head over heels for a classmate. At the time, I daydreamed about him, cared immensely and truly for him, and would do anything to make sure that he was okay. We weren’t dating though, and I had the (silly) belief that I could make him end up falling for me in the end. But by the end of it (8 months later), he confessed himself that he was only using me for resources and to get to wherever he needed to be at in life. This hurt a lot, but I did have enough rational sense surprisingly to pick myself up, dust myself off, and gradually move on. I swore to myself that I no longer wanted a lover, a boyfriend, none of that. I decided to try to focus more on myself and my journey in life. A few months later, I was casually scrolling through Instagram,…

How should one cheer herself up when feeling extremely low?
There are a couple of things I try to do! 1. I will see whether I am sitting alone in my room or not. If I am, then I immediately go sit with family. This is because for me, if I am alone and feeling blue, sometimes I end up overthinking myself into a negative spiral of doom and gloom - that is the last thing that I want! 2. I’ll play some silly songs such as “The Duck Song”, “Krabs Bop” or “F.U.N. Song”, and dance to those; sometimes, I will video call my friend so we both can dance to it too! If not those songs, then I will try and learn some Tik Tok dances, simply because I like to dance! :D 3. I’ll call my boyfriend and talk to him about it. He normally listens, then talks about it with me, and then eventually distracts me and cheers me up through the crazy, weird, and funny conversations that we…

Depressed when listening to the weeknd? For me it brings back memories of a very low point in my life when I started listening to his music. I'm back to it and just can't stop the rampant depression I feel is kicking. Anyone else?
I can understand this too. Quite a few of his songs, such as “Belong To The World” and “Wicked Games” do push me into a depressive state. Personally, I am aware of this, so I try to listen to other Weeknd songs. I also previously stayed away from those songs until I grew into a better mental state, by which once I began to listen to those songs, they made me think of other things, or I would notice little things about the songs that I didn’t before!
For now, I would advise you to avoid those songs and listen to other upbeat Weeknd songs that don’t bring you back to that point in life. And if they do, then perhaps switch to other XO artists, like NAV. :)

Why is my rough phase not ending? My DOB is 19/12/1991 at 15:30 in Pune, Maharashtra.
It depends on what has happened to you during this rough phase, but since I do not know, I’ll give my thoughts on this. From your question, I am assuming that you were expecting a rough phase in your life to appear, and now are waiting for it to end. This mental preparation I believe has resulted in you noticing every small negative event that happens with you, which you may be putting down to your rough phase. This is why I think it is not ending. Now, to solve this, you need to take your own life and destiny into your own hands. As Mark Manson has said: “With great responsibility comes great power.” So now, you need to try to acknowledge what is happening in your life, reframe your mind into a more optimistic mental state, and then think to yourself: “Will I care about these events in 2 we…

Is it true that people with money say, money doesn’t bring happiness, in order to keep poor people in their place?
I don’t think so. Let’s start with defining happiness in this case. Temporary or eternal? Let’s go with the idea that happiness in this case is classed as long-lasting/permanent, whilst satisfaction is temporary. The phrase “money doesn’t bring happiness” to me suggests that the purchasing power that money possesses doesn’t necessarily guarantee happiness. Let’s delve into this a bit deeper. To start with, buying materialistic objects comes with some satisfaction when it is brand new. Then as time goes on, your level of satisfaction goes back to how it was before purchasing the object. Let’s give an example: When you switch to the latest iPhone, when it is brand new, your level of satisfaction has an increase - all those brand new features to play with and set up, and the super clear camera,…

How is it possible for God to be eternal- without beginning or end?
I think that since we are unable to completely prove or confirm God’s existence, proving his eternality is currently out of the question.
Perhaps an interesting proof would be that God is eternal through us humans believing in God throughout all the Centuries, and hopefully onwards too, thus keeping God as eternal in our hearts.

What is love?
Love cannot be put into an exact definition. It is just an unexplainable feeling.
Love is when you see your family come through the arrival gate at the airport, after not seeing them for ages.
Love is when your partner is there for you throughout the good and the bad.
Love is when your pet jumps all over you as soon as you get inside your home from a long day at work.
Love is when despite wanting the last cookie, your mother offers it to you anyway :)
Love is when despite having painful arthritis in knees, your grandmother goes to fill up a hot water bottle for you because you can’t move due to period cramps.
Love is when you offer your arms to a baby to hold them and they come to you!
Love is when people ask you “How are you feeling?”
Love is priceless. Love is pure.

Would you rather know when you will die or how you will die?
Assuming that I must choose out of the two, I would rather know when I die. Let’s look at the other side first. Knowing how you die but not when can extremely limit you. For example, let’s say that you die by being hit by a car. This would inevitably lead to strong fear and paranoia in most people, where every time they would step out of the security of their home, they would quickly become overwhelmed by the possibility of their death occurring: “Okay, there are a few cars here. I really don’t want to cross the road…ahhh what if a car doesn’t stop? Oh! Green man is here, I probably should go - have all the cars stopped? Okay good, let’s go- the green man has disappeared, I am not risking it!! It’s okay SpectrumKnight14, I’ll just wait away from the road for the next green man.” See the paran…

Would you rather have kids and not want them, or want to have kids but can’t have them?
I would rather want kids but not be able to have them. Since this is asking for my personal view, I shall answer it from that perspective. Assuming that I have kids and did not want them, this seems to suggest that I was forced to have them. I would do my best to provide for them and give them everything they need, but I do not think that it would all be done whole-heartedly if I didn’t want kids in the first place. Hence they would inevitably not receive that true, unconditional, motherly love that children should be nurtured with. On the other side, I would rather have kids but not be able to have them, for two reasons. The first is that I know that I would be able to shower that motherly, true love upon the children, and the second is that there are other options available of having child…

Prior to his appearance on the A&E show, Burrell served in the Marines from 2006 to 2010 and completed two tours in Iraq. He continued to serve in the Reserves for three years before he was honorably discharged in 2013. “Nathan loved his country, loved his family and was a very caring guy,"" Walker told TMZ.
‘60 Days In’ Star Nate Burrell Dies by Suicide After Rape Charge
Nate Burrell, who appeared on the third and fourth season of the A&E show, was charged last month with rape and multiple counts of assault.
https://www.thedailybeast.com/60-days-in-star-nate-burrell-dies-by-suicide-after-rape-charge
I just finished Season 4 of 60 Days In and he was by far my favorite participant. He was the only one that agreed to do an additional 60 days beyond the required 60 days in, hence him being in both Season 3 and Season 4.
I read that he was going through a nasty divorce and that his soon-to-be ex wife set him up on all charges brought against him. May he rest in peace and know his time served in the military and time served trying to better the Fulton County prison system is appreciated. He truly made a difference in the times before any charges were brought against him.

What did a family member say or do that you don't talk to them anymore?
I was adopted by an amazing family when I was 4 1/2. My adoptive mom and adoptive dad had a biological child, my adoptive sister, who was 3 years my senior that was killed in a car accident when she was 21. I was 18 and a senior in high school. The loss of my sister devastated us all and changed the framework for our family for sure. My mom, dad, and I became even closer and cling to one another after knowing that any of us could be gone in an instant after losing my sister under such sudden circumstances. Fast forward 27 years. My father was diagnosed with Brain Cancer. He quickly gave me Power of Attorney to make all medical and financial decisions on his behalf since he knew I’d honor his every wish.

I agree that this question lacks context and is therefore impossible to answer definitively. But, do forgive me if this seems insensitive here, but I’m more concerned for the person posting….Reasoning: If a guy I just broke up with just told me he intentionally went out of his way to hurt me, my first question would be:
Is this guy in his right mind? (I.e. is he dangerous?? Do you I need to protect yourself?) myself here?) and next,
Why do I want to know anything more about someone that wants to hurt me?? (Assuming you did nothing wrong since you are asking why he hated you and wanted to hurt you)
I am a much older adult so much more pragmatic in retrospect regarding relationships no doubt. But I am concerned that this person posting the question may be trying to figure out the other person when all we can truly know or control is ourseourself and how we choose to respond.

How does Xanax work, and what are the effects on the brain?
It’s a benxodiazepine. Depends on the age of person taking, amount and duration- low long. It’s best used on on a short term basis; potential to be highly addictive, drug of abuse & dependence. Withdrawing from it can result in death.
Neurophysiologically , it increases amount of GABA in the brain— leads to relaxation, sedation etc.. Linking recently to Alzheimer’s disease.

Yes, I'm a psychiatric RN in a large facility. It's best practice to ask the nature of the voices. You've got to look at the underlying psyche of a schizophrenic. It's a thought disorder... If we look to a disorder in which someone would be experiencing what was perceived as good I would think Bipolar. Individuals with Bipolar suffer from grandiosity. Additionally, one can suffer from Bipolar with psychotic features... They experience delusions and hallucinations.

The voices are a reflection of inner state. They are rarely positive. If a schizophrenic person is laughing it could be because they have immense emotional mismatching (I.e. Laughing when they should cry, or vice versa). They can hear what they describe as ""chatter"" or have command hallucination which usually tell them to harm themselves. Many times patients do not like to repeat what they are hearing or saying, but I've never had a patient say that the voice said anything positive.

When will I stop feeling nervous around girls? Will it ever stop?
Nothing will change if you do not put in the effort to change it.
Few pointers:
Nervousness usually stems from lack of self esteem. Build your self esteem. Read six pillars of self esteem.
Analyze why you are nervous and find a solution. Read: Rafael Nadal's answer to How can you train your brain to stay calm in situations where previously you were very anxious?
Agree with Ankit. When you meet girls stop visualizing her as a GF, marriage, sex, hangout.
Develop yourself as man who can attract girls. Read up about Pick-up-artist (PUA) culture. Best resource here is: The game by neil strauss.
Develop your inner game. Read David De Angelo’s Inner Game.

How can you train your brain to stay calm in situations where previously you were very anxious?
I have been in many such situations. To address is it, i have tried many techniques that were suggested by the others but in vain (just my experience). After researching on the topic for years, i now follow a 3 step process to effectively cope with such situations. Step 1: Understand the ‘why’. Anxiety triggers are unique to a person and one needs to understand the root causes. This is not a easy process. To understand your triggers (technical term: anchors), i put myself in a state of trance and visualize the scenario ( which shoots up my anxiety). Scenario could be public speaking, talking to a beautiful woman, pre-game jitters. Trust me, if you do this right then you will have the same physical reaction (e.g sweating profusely) as in the real life scenario. This will aid in understanding t…

If you’re so in favor of people bleeding and dying you should go there. Show what your made of instead of wishing people dead, because that’s what happens.

Make sure you tell the practitioner if you have or wear the invisible (progressive) bifocal lenses in your glasses. I left the first session and had vertigo. I had to crawl back to the office to wait it out.
The EMDR did help with my pain though, but was too short on the number of visits.

What advice can you give to new programmers?
As developers, we all crave greatness, relevance, and growth. A newbie want’s to build her first app, a junior wants to take on senior developer role and likewise a senior too want’s match up as a world class developer.
One thing that hinders us from been a better programmer is all about process. I have learnt this lesson so far that all results are born of process. If you hope to become a better programmer, adopt a better process. This article on medium shade more light on it, hope you grab something that’s going change your life for the best.

I began as a simple lunch server at the age of 17–18 at a very busy restaurant. I then began working at night serving being one of the head servers…
Soon thereafter, they asked me to begin bartending; and soon enough, I was promoted to The head closing bartender. We served food until 1:00Am, and we’re open late hours, with last call for alcohol being (if I remember correctly..) at around 2:00 am, give or take, and depending On the amount of people in the establishment. -Everyone was to be legally without alcohol in hand by 2:30am..(again.. if I recall accurately..)..
We also had our bar clocks set 10 mins ahead to avoid any arguments over “time..”
(Lol))
(Mind you.. this was ALL b4 the smart phones were around and what not.).
I’ll first began working here directly out of Hugh School in the year of 1989.. (And stayed there for nearly 12 YEARS!!). I still miss those days and ESPECIALLY the people!!!💯❤️
Anyways, while getting into bartending, it was approximately, or around, the year of 1995.
It was my first real serving job and bartending, which I never anticipated doing, as it wasn’t very appealing to me when I was younger as I had an Aunt that had done it her whole life (or so it seemed..) and it appeared to cause her tremendous chaos.. But who knows if it was the position or bad boyfriends.. 🤦🏼‍♀️😥—
Ok, so anyhow, this Place became like A second Family to Me!!!❤️
It was independently owned by an Absolutely Wonderful Man named “Lennie.”
Lennies was the owner (obviously)… And, I, just as ALOT of his Close employees felt, was like our 2nd Dad!! (Or… in some people’s cases… their only “Dad..”).
❤️The restaurant was like ONE HUGE CLOSE KNIT FAMILY, for the most part!!❤️
And We had VERY LITTLE, if any, turnover…
Anyhow,, Before I knew it—-I was asked to become a closing manager, in which I could still bartend. (Along with a significant pay increase as well..)
There were only two of us, as far as managers went, at night.. And one Shift Lead/Manager for days…
The other lady’s name that I managed with was; “MaryBeth..”
She was somewhat newer to our crew and a bit bizarre, but seemed fine with me and working together with me…
However, just as most people do, and IS mainly NO FAULT OTHER THAN MY OWN for allowing it to continually happen, she tended to also take Full advantage of my “passive-such-nature.”
-As I was (and still somewhat am, and have been, one at always having Extreme difficulty saying “No,” and allowing to be a “doormat” too often…”-
But heyyy... It is what it is..😁
Ok, back to the story…
—-So…we were closed on Sundays, as the owner was a wonderful family oriented and caring father figure that he wanted US ALL to have ONE for sure FAMILY like day off ALWAYS..—-
.. So, MaryBeth chose to work Monday’s, Tuesday’s and Wednesday as her days..
And my days would consist of; Thursday’s, Friday’s and Saturday…. the busiest days of the week. (But I Agreed, so my fault…)
Nonetheless, MatBeth would come in for a few hours and just pretty much hostess and what not on the weekends, just as I came in for a few hours on Tuesdays as we had entertainment On Tuesday evenings, so it tended to get a big overwhelming at times for her alone…🙄
There was a General Motors plant (36th Steer in Wyoming, Michigan..) right down the road, as in 2 or so blocks away…
So.. We have ALOT (sometimes seemed like the whole plant was there ..😊) of regulars that would come in late night-all night, and it would get pretty rowdy at times.
Anyways, I learned a lot here.. Both..good and bad from people in general, mainly fellow temporary employees that would work there for a VERY short period of time…
And, Because Lennie was like a second father to me and I had complete respect for my job in a whole, I would have absolutely zero tolerance for patients for stealing!!
I caught cooks taking steaks, I’m talking CASES of steaks, CASES upon CASES of beer, etc. right out of the back door.
Thank goodness I had the key to the liquor room or that would’ve been compromised as well!!
And mind you, as I mentioned earlier, we did have the high technology (cameras, etc..), as we have today.
However, there was one installed at the entrance where things were going out of.
But, Most of the employees were very faithful and loyal.
However, during the weekends we would have additional/part time bartenders work, Whom would each begin with a set amount of money to start with in their till, and a manager standing by While the bartenders counted it prior to the shift. Then, at the end of their shift ,it would be balanced out with their cash and sales charges on a print out, That should all have equaled out accordingly.
(of course there were some mistakes that were easily explainable..)
however we have a loyal customers, as well whom alerted us seeing what they thought, these bartenders stealing…
mainly not ringing in drinks amongst other things…
So, the owner would, for example, put an extra stack of $100 of one dollar bills wrapped up into the starting drawer. The drawer should always have began at 250 total. With this extra set of money that would’ve been 350 which the bartender should have immediately reported it to the manager or shift leader standing by. this was one method we would use to see If they were possibly stealing. Anyways, we would give them the chance and let them work their shift and at the end of the shift there shouldn’t of been an extra $100, giving them the opportunity to having it possibly overlooked. Unfortunately, in several cases this Did not happen and they stole the money. Another common tactic they were here it was was that people would come in and run a tab so where they were just write it down on paper. Or just supposedly “memorize it in their head”. When it was time to cash out what they would charge the customer say 3850 for their tab but push the “no sale button.” Then, at the end of the night, they would put that money in their pocket as well…🤦🏼‍♀️
anyways these are just a few, very minimal ways in which we used Wayyyy back in the day to catch thievery in the restaurants by bartenders and it’s just a shame..😥

It’s refreshing to AT THE VERY LEAST, FINALLY see some proof, of what most of us already knew, regarding this voter fraud against President Trump!!!
Now…. I SURE hope that something is done about it and that the proper votes go to The vote that they were meant to go to, & who We The People Chose! Trump won! It’s should be fairly easy to prove w/the witness mentioned!

I agree!
Meaning that VERY last sentence says it ALL in a nutshell, doesn’t it?😥
So sad, but so true!
To somewhat re-quote what you mentioned was;
—Do you think that someone who gave up on you sooo easily was really your “true love,” or worth all of your heartache and tears, or who you were really meant to be with forever?—
Although the answer is simple, it’s very difficult for sooo many of us, including myself..😥
I wonder why..
Why is it that men seem to always just give up so easily & quickly?😥

If you could read only one book what book would it be and why?
“Get the chance to read a book” as in I will not be able to read any other book for the rest of eternity ?
Or perhaps more like - you get the chance to read a book you’ve always wanted to read but haven’t.
If it is the former then I would choose a comedy book, probably Hitcher's Guide to the Galaxy would be a pretty good choice.
If it is the latter then I’ll probably go with Argentinian writer Alejandra Pizarnik and its collection of poems, I have been meaning to read that book for a while now.

Do you agree with the saying “Show me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are”?
Yes, I do. Five years ago, when I was entering college, I had social anxiety, the first days of the semester I struck up a conversation with someone that later became one of my best friends, he is more extroverted than me and, at the time, I perceived him to be less socially awkward than I was. Throughout the following months I saw him behave around others and I began to imitate him. To this day I find myself saying the same phrases that he used to say, and the same speech and behavior patterns he has. I sometimes wonder how I would behave socially had I not met him, or had I met and became friends with a different person than him. Friends influences us to a great extend. Perhaps more than we can tell. I believe that the effect that a friend will have upon you depends on how much do you valu…

I’m finding research that correlates high functioning (FKA Asperger’s) autism with Neanderthal DNA. It makes sense that there’s an uncanny valley when NT observes ND if there’s truly a DNA difference.
I’m not sure what I am. Sometimes I think I’m NT masking as an ND since I’m outnumbered at work.
I’m 2% Neanderthal. Anyone else have their 23&Me Neanderthal %?

Sometimes, we have this problem at the intersection near my office if a motorcycle is first or the first person doesn’t pull up enough.
If the sensors are not working, you have to eventually go. I’ve seen people take a right, then a U turn to avoid running a red light. I’ve seen others just proceed with caution. You should call the highway department so they know the sensor isn’t working.

Is that a color blind thing? or just people being on autopilot while driving? We have a traffic light by my office, and we’ve learned to never just go when it turns green. More often than not, people will run that light from both directions.

I did an extended amount of research and honestly the best option you’re going to have is something with built-in refrigeration cycling which I’ve never seen before. Passing pet water through a plumb setup with a pump is difficult on any machine over time due to buildup. I don’t see anything as an option here besides modifying a water filtration and refrigeration unit to be a custom fit.
Coolant has a tendency to leak after a while in warm climates, so it can be risky. From here, perhaps getting 2 Taurus bowls and rotating them with the inside-stored water being half-frozen might be your best bet.. that way it melts over time.

It’s fur. Fairly sure that shot was from shedding season. Also cat colds happen. Once every few years it goes around. He used to get into everything and run out the door no matter how much I tried to keep him in. Sometimes he’d just get a cold. These days it’s more allergies due to the extreme climate.

What does it mean when a cat sleeps near your face? Is this normal behavior for cats?
So, in the world of cats we all want to say there’s a lot of deeper-meaning to the activities of our creatures. Sometimes there is. Sometimes there isn’t. While it’s true that a good amount of cats will only sleep on-top of you or near your head to express trust and affection, the cold-hard-truth is that.. well.. our head puts out a good amount of heat. Cats love heat. Have you ever left a pillow for a minute to use the bathroom and noticed your spot has been usurped by a feline pillow-thief? Heat. A normal body-temperature for a feline is between 101.F to 102.5°F (38.3C to 39.2°C for my Euro-centric friends) and when you’re sleeping or laying down, your body temperature will typically climb. Add a blanket and your kitty is in feline heaven. The more comfortable your kitty is, though, the mo…

Where can I find a pet water bowl which is actively refrigerated, like with a cooling coil and small compressor? A small refrigerator with no lid that is.
There’s some you can buy from places like Torus (This is the one I use) where you fill the body with water, and it fills the bowl itself. For this, I fill the bowl with extremely cold water, which chills the water being cycled through the bowl. This is the cheapest option. For active refrigeration, you’re going to need something a little more extreme. I recommend the Primo setup. Lowes sells it, and while a bit expensive, especially since you will require filtered water refills, it’s actually a very good set. Especially if you have a feline that deals with urinary crystals— since you know what they’re getting is clean. It’s large, but this may not be a bad thing. It’s great for pets as well as humans. The only thing I don’t like is the bowl is plastic, which can contribute to pet acne. Avalon…

As it turns out, Karma is a Bombay. According to a DNA test? test and identifying traits. We did the test to help figure out if she had any markers we needed to be aware of, but with her it’s ironic that the cost of the kind of cat she likely is would be so high, when the original owner was so focused on something exotic and rare. My husband and I don’t care if she’s a fish. She’s pure. A purely wonderful Bombay. They go for around $500–$2000. Karma is also completely healthy, a female, and has the makings of a showcat if we can get her skin problem handled.¶

good cat.¶

It was hard living with with the other woman. Very hard. Our apartment was about 450 SQFT. We didn’t have the room for three people. We made do because we didn’t want to see her homeless. That being said, we’re now extremely cautious about having people come and stay with us. We really don’t want any more pets coming over either. They usually end up staying for some reason.

Karma spent a week week walking around crying. I managed to get the claw caps off of her, and switched her food to something less.. meow-mixy. Maybe that would help her hairball issue? A brief inspection of the cat showed some.. some pretty awful things. Her fur was horribly greasy and dirty. Her dirty, to the point her skin was falling off. An old flea collar had been around her neck for so long that the skin was scabbed and bleeding, and the fur was gone below it. Her ears were black with dirt and she constantly scratched at them.¶

We were so broke that I had to do did what I could for her at home. It took a few months to gather up the money to take her to the vet, and when I asked for my former houseguest’s help, it ended up being the last time she spoke to me. Originally, she was going to send for the cat later on.. on after she’d settled. Now? Radio silence. She never helped me with Karma, nor sent for her cat.

After a single week of walking around and crying, we felt a light “fwump” on the end of the bed, and a weight settle between us. Karma wiggled down between our bodies and began heartily purring. That was the first time she let us touch her. From that point though, she honestly never left us alone. Every hour we were home she had something to tell us, and begged for little rubs and pets. She always wanted something. To this day she has to sleep between us, or just be on top of someone— though her shyness still comes through from time to time.

I worked in a vet. The dna test was through the facility I worked at. It wasn’t an online test. It was for health reasons more than for “fun.” The test was to determine issues to look for that are susceptible in the feline due to its genetics. Not to say “I have a 20% x!”

Do people dislike Bengal cats?
Everyone dislikes something. A cat is a cat is a cat. People dislike cats. It can be to be contrarian or because there’s some reason to not like the pet. As far as Bengal cats specifically go, there’s a few specific reasons someone may not particularly enjoy having one around all the time. I’ve had a Bengal mix for 13 years now and he’s a handful. After Vergil I’ll probably never have one again, not because I don’t like them, but because they’re an insane amount of work that I just don’t have the energy for. When someone says “I don’t like Bengal cats.” It can really be a loaded response. It could be more leaned towards “I don’t like how loud they are” since good lord they’re loud. It could be leaned towards how needy the cat is. Maybe it’s even pointed to the amount of one-on-one a Bengal…

How cold is too cold for a cat?
You’ll typically know from behavior how cold is too cold for a cat. They’ll have poofy fur, be standing closer to something warmer (or huddled up) and moving either much, much less to preserve body-heat.. or in the case of an indoor-cat throwing themselves off the walls like they’ve been possessed by the spirit of Hermes to deliver a message from the gods to every single spirit at the same time of the next Greek gods birth. Breed and coat type have a bit to do with this. Fur coats on cats are made up of different layers. The “professional” names for these are down, awn guard, and vibrissae. Down keeps the cat warm and is closest to the skin. This is what sheds after the season. Awn is in the middle of the coat and is the thermal insulator. Guard fur are the wiggly bits at the top you see th…

That's why I said VG-10 is a great option. Along with most CPM stainless steel families, Elmax, and a whole lot of European stainless steel s. The cheap Victorinox stuff is extremely good for chef duties. But Carbon is something special for me. A good D2 blade or A2 my God! Those are tool steels though.

What would happen if someone decided to go into a shark cage to observe saltwater crocodiles like divers do with great white sharks?
Generally, they are very without any interest. Sharks are way more curious and we'll bahaved, unless it's bullshaks. These are dangerous.

*Embarrased* Yes, I did this yesterday. Sent , fortunately, only $30 worth to the wrong Binance.US | Buy & Sell Crypto wallet. Both wallets were mine, transferring from an outside wallet to my Binance one, the coin ref was D… I copy pasted a wallet Dd…. if you get my drift. It took me a full 24 hrs to realise my mistake.
Its so easy, late in the day, when you’re tired, or had a wee tipple, to make silly errors.
In my experience, do your crypto business early in the day, WRITE DOWN the COIN NAME you’re transferring then double check what’s on your screen before you do any trade whatsoever.
For trading in Coin; ie, you’re watching the coin/usd or coin/btc during a dip, do the obvious, stay sharp, be prepared and STAY on the trading/live page of your primary wallet preference.
Cheers for giving me the opportunity to own up to a classic mistake, thank the crypto fairy it was only small fish fry coin I’d won in a giveaway!

your attitude is straight forward ABUSE! Not taking medication could lead to the worst case scenario of suicidal attempts. BPD can not be dealt with, it’s a brain chemical issue. I am BPD schizophrenic.

The space is moderated by Jacob Garrison (I believe) who states he is schizophrenic himself. My understanding is that Jacob created a space for people who, like him, need support occasionally. Not an appointment with a therapist or psychiatrist.
So, if I had a question relevant for this space, I would expect answers from ‘persons of experience’ not necessarily a professional.
I am schizophrenic with Bipolar Mood Affective Disorder. As such I have a sizeable amount of life skills, experiences and answers for this condition.
The one problem I have had to deal with is: delusions of grandeur when answering questions on Quora! When I am in episode, that happens!

It was me that asked the original question.
I’m suffering auditory hallucinations, sleep deprivation as you describe, agoraphobia due to the voices from every window, the anxiety so bad that I literally lost use of my legs walking from the mail room to home. I’m so distressed but have to control my emotions because my husband doesn’t believe that I have schizophrenia. For him, I stopped my meds, discharged from my psychiatrist and live a life where I shake in the shower, cooking, can’t look out windows. The voices are so overwhelming. They talk about me not to me.
My husband is quadriplegic and thinks my hallucinations are the same as the PTSD voices he hears inside his head. He has learned to ignore them. Therefore says I can overcome mine.
I’m replying to you because you will understand the trauma and fears, the feelings of helplessness and despair.. so on.
i have no hope. I’m on 5mg diazepam a day… not much use.
Im gonna have to hope I can survive this nightmare.

Why are so many mentally ill people who suffer from schizophrenia convinced the FBI and/or government are watching them?
I don’t know the answer to this but can confirm that I have and do believe that people are listening and watching me, making notes so they can find a reason to get me arrested or sectioned.
I used to think ICE were tracking me.
My Son also believed that the authorities had cameras and microphones installed to spy on him.
its an odd feeling, a scary one. Social media doesn’t help because a schizophrenic person can project that everyone knows what the password is etc.
i hope someone has a better answer for you!

I must apologize, the reply, now I have read it back, was defensive and characteristically filtered through my own schizophrenic episode.
At the time I replied, I strongly believed that ‘entities’ were infringing my rights, stealing or controlling my thoughts and, at worst, planning my murder.
My schizophrenia was triggered late, aged 50, by serotonin syndrome from meds I was prescribed. I have had mental health problems most of my life and would say that my ‘personality’ is ‘open’ to be fooled by incorrect synaptic responses. I’m still schizophrenic, I can’t function on medication, so I live with the illness the best I can. Again, sorry for my odd response!
10 years before I was diagnosed, my 16 yr old son suffered a severe schizophrenic psychotic event that had him sectioned under UK law, sent to intensive care: safe padded soft room with 2 medical staff and a security officer. For everyone’s safety. He was ill for almost a year, then a ‘spark in him demanded his real self to pay attention and get out’ - his words.
My son came home 4 weeks later. His schizophrenia was triggered by traumatic events I don’t want to expound upon. No drugs were in his bloodstream, it was not induced.
There could be an hereditary element.
hopefully, this is a more useful reply!

Are schizophrenics who hear auditory hallucinations ever afraid of the voice?
I’m petrified constantly of the voices, which are external in nature, associated with schizophrenia.
They hate, they destroy and discuss how to get me evicted, at worst how to end my life.
I get so anxious that I go into a catatonic fear state, I can’t move nor speak. It’s hell.

What are the formulaic lifestyles to give yourself schizophrenia?
Why do you ask such a ridiculous question about a life debilitating condition?
You can’t give yourself schizophrenia. And you had best hope to the maximum that you never have to experience it.
Hell on earth puts the symptoms mildly. Tortured to ‘death’ still isn’t close.
You want to induce schizophrenia? I believe some street drugs will manifest a pseudo-phrenia but not something I’d encourage, regret will be the result in every aspect.
Schizophrenia can affect anyone from every one of the human formulaic lifestyles.

What does co-parenting look like to you?
I will preface this by saying that this is exclusively about co parenting and does not apply to situations in which there are safety issues. Sometimes being a co parent with your ex means that things are not the best for you personally as an individual. In fact it may be extremely difficult and outright inconvenient for you at times. Try to remember that they can probably say the same thing when it comes to dealing with you at times. Before you do absolutely anything that will effect your kid(s), stop and think about whether it's really best for the child(ren) that are involved. Then consider whether or not your short term action designed to have immediate results will have long term consequences. If you are the only one that will have any positive results, with your ex and most importantly…

How can I create a multiple Facebook account with one email acciunt?
No, in an effort to fight the creation of fake profiles FB does not allow multiple accounts from the same email or phone number. If you are using your mobile device (which you probably are), there are several good apps (duel messenger, duel space, duel app etc etc) that will allow you to have multiple versions of many apps that have the same limitations. Many phones have the function built in like Samsung has duo preinstalled. You will need to use a secondary email though, which most people have atleast one extra email address (or like me several lol). If you don't there's a million free email hosting sites available. It's a pretty easy process altogether if you really need a second account. But the real question is what do you need it for?

Next time you have a bath, stay in the tub while the water drains at the end, either sitting or lying down - I think that's the closest you'll get to simulating the physical feeling of what it's like to be depressed.

Don't do it. Take a break. Let your body rest for a while and recuperate. Once you start, you can't start. It's a whole different monster and one you won't be able to shake.

Every time I feel really down, I like to draw blood with a syringe from the vein and I feel refreshed or calm afterwards when I see the blood. Is it considered as self-harming or just a coping mechanism? Is it normal?
It is self-harming and self-harming is a coping mechanism. It's not a normal coping mechanism. It is a result of a mental illness. You don't have the tools to properly deal with stress and anxiety.

What kinds of online contents do you wish to have had access to when dealing with mental health issues when you were young?
I love that I can have private sessions with my therapist online front the comfort of my home and I don't have to go in the office to see her. My anxiety was crippling and I absolutely hated having to go in the office for appointments. I'm much more likely to keep my appointments and stick with my treatment plan when because I'm more comfortable in a setting like this.

How do doctors respond to the report that Black babies are 3 times more likely to die when treated by white doctors?
As an aspiring doctor, I can tell you my opinion. This needs to be taken seriously. I am white, and so I need to be cognizant, as a student and future professional, of the differing symptoms that various life threatening illnesses tend to present in differing races. Symptoms are different for gender, that has been proven, so why is it so hard to believe that the symptoms expressed may be different for varying races? We can already quantitatively say that certain races are more likely to die of certain illnesses, so why are we not asking WHY? It could be just genetics, or it could be in that gene's EXPRESSION. Which definitely varies between people, not to mention races! And for those wondering, it's not eugenics to say that a black man experiencing a heart attack may have a different set of symptoms than a white man, or a black woman and a white woman. That's science that is used to SAVE lives, not to discriminate or end them. Doctors as a whole need to be cognizant of that, and most of all, listen to their fucking patients. White doctors may also be minimizing the problem of their black patients, this isn't uncommon. The same thing happens with white male doctors and white female patients. I don't like to see male doctors, because they don't understand. Everyone needs representation, and everyone needs to be understood. In the medical field, this is probably the most important thing we can do to keep patients feeling like they can actually come to us with their problems. We can't help patients that don't trust us. And if that happens to be because you're a racist doctor, then I think you should lose your license. 🤷‍♀️

Black History & Politics · March 21, 2022
This breaks my heart. History 101 “In Louisiana, Black women were put in cells with male prisoners and some became pregnant. In 1848, legislators passed a new law declaring that all children born in the penitentiary of African American parents serving life sentences would be property of the state. The women would raise the kids until the age of ten, at which point the penitentiary would place an ad in the newspaper. Thirty days later, the children would be auctioned off on the courthouse steps 'cash on delivery.' The proceeds were used to fund schools for white children. . . many of [the Black children] were purchased by prison officials.” Vintage Art Times - Jerry Palmer Source: “American Prison: A Reporter's Undercover Journey into the Business of Punishment” by Shane Bauer, 2018 #blackhistorymonth #blackhistorymonth2022 #𝗕𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗛𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 #𝗕𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗛𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝗢𝘂𝗿𝗛𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆

I’m a teen boy. I want to be pretty, handsome, sexy, but I’m really ugly and I’m so lazy that I don’t want to make any efforts to change anything. I’m sad because I want to change my entire body. What can I do?
I know this may sounds cliche but trust me, work on your education first at the same time make a lot of friends, eat well exercise regularly. When you’re graduate with good result, you you’ll have a good job and good pay. Then being handsome and sexy won’t be the priority anymore. When you have everything all ladies will come to you (check with the good quality one) you can be handsome and sexy with good job, highly educated despite of psychically only.
Being funny, nice, polite, educated, common sense, believer, humble, confident are sexy. There’s many traits can make you appear handsome and sexy. Good luck

How long have you battled depression? What's your advice?
I would say half of my life I’m battling with depression What i can advice you as I’m still practicing in my daily life now; 1. Keep believe in yourself that you’re worthy as you don't need others validation to keep you do what you're doing 2. If you are in the hectic situation, try to take a break. I used to delay my dateline bcos I'm struggling with myself and get back to work when I'm relieved 3. Find someone you can talk to. If you don't have, keep writing down whatever you feel inside. 4. Get a good sleep and et well 5. If you are a believer, pray to God for His blessings and protection 6. Don't do something that can harm you. You'll regret and trust me you will 7. Cut social media interactions as much as you can. Sometimes I do get depressing with the news and people's posting so what I can do is to stop myself…

What foods are good for your health?
Eat balanced diets. For instance, practise the quarter, quarter and half. Which means 1/4 protein-based food, 1/4 carbohydrates and 1/2 fruits and vegetables. Drink a lot of plain water. Omit bicarbonate drink, wine, beer. Don't skip your meal especially breakfast. There is saying, eat breakfast like a king, have lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. Good luck
side notes: dont be a vegan to stay very healthy

What is the meaning of the Thai proverb:''เอากุ้งฝอยไปตกปลากะพง''?
It means you put little effort but expect a big result. If you translate it literally, it means fishing a sea bass by a little shrimp.

Oh yes! Your point is amazing. I agree with it. Conformity is important to keep the harmony of the society. By the way, what about pointing problems out or recognize them? but someone hates it and said the person should get out of the country. (I mean someone that believes that there’re no problems or think that the country is perfect even though some other groups are suffering ) Is this a nationalism? I think it is, but in an unproductive way because I think people who realize the problems will be able to solve the problems rather than people who ignore it. What do you think about this? (You’ve said that acknowledging faults is not anti-nationalism) I like your answer by the way.

I do agree with you that nationalism can make the country better, but can it ever be too much? for example, you can’t criticize when there’re problems because other will tell you to get out of the country or even someone uses pride to look down the minorities and other countries. Aren’t these too much? or is it just a normal way that people should do?

That’s pretty hilarious for the French one lol. By the way, in my language, when I hear people insult (or just normal speaking), it sounds very hurtful and insensitive to me (full of sarcasm and belittlement) or you can say I feel more offended but when I get insulted in English I feel less emotionally involved and it doesn’t hurt that much. Have you ever felt this way towards your native language? I’m just curious.

OMG such a player! Believe me after he gets what he wants, he'll be gone quick, or he might start an argument with you, so he can justify it to himself why he's through with you.

Can you get PTSD from growing up with a narcissistic parent and a family who always treated you as if you were stupid, never enough and a problem?
Absolutely you can get PTSD from that and can leave permanent damage to someone. I must say that every person in the world is different and cope with severe psychological trauma or physical trauma not necessarily physical abuse but also just witnessing some type of violent behavior or anything! Especially!! as children! I've suffer from PTSD from things that I was exposed to when I was 9–13 years old that left severe psychological problems. So just in case you might have others about it and they didn't seem like it was anything because they might have dealt differently or perhaps they don't even understand the slightest that reality and impact. You know, some people might say “oh that wouldn't bother me “ are probably just faking tough skin to imply how tough they are. That's false. So if…

Why do I feel pleasure When seeing other people cry?
I think I know why you feel pleasure when you see others cry. About 20 years ago I was somewhat interested in being an EMT and helping people who are in some kind of crisis. The more I explored all the details having to do with it, I found myself very difficult to think and somehow separate myself from this person who is badly hurt and bleeding and blood and screaming and crying and dying. I sympathized so much that I couldn't handle it. I would almost pass out and could not do it. I told my friend who had been an EMT for quite awhile told me that you very much need to separate yourself and think. I asked him how. He said that everyone he worked with basically said that they're just thinking how glad they are that it isn't them and then after time they just became numb and totally outside…

Why are some people so possessive in relationships?
I have alot of past experience with possessiveness in relationships. The simple answer is insecurity. Maybe a fear of losing a special person. So you have a kinda self protection response and your brain decides that in order to keep what you value so much is to “guard"" this one to keep from any possible or literally anything that maybe the smallest threat to your special one. Before long without even realizing it because all of your time is spent in protecting you from loss that you easily don't adequately use the common sense part of your brain because you only concentrate on losing that person. So any little tiny thing you perceive as a threat and maybe get a little angry about suspicious people who you think might be trying to take this person from you and you can't let that happen. So…

Is it stupid to become FWB with someone you really care about? Should you only be FWB with someone you don't really care for?
Well speaking from experience the whole Fwb thing rarely ever works out fairly or satisfactory for both parties and that's usually because one person actually has more deeper feelings for the other and when the other person finds out or even just suspects it then things get way more serious and complicated and almost always it ends badly and I do mean ends! Then there's no longer Fwb but no benefits and no longer friends because one has ruined it for the other and now guess what? They lose all credibility and the other person whom you thought was so cool has real trouble believing anything so almost always the friendship ends permanently! Both are hurt and confused and frustrated. Even if both people start out with the same ideas and understanding and know all about what they both want. Th…

How can you strengthen your relationship with your friends?
Oh there are many ways you can do that. The best ways I have found is to consider spending more time with them, ask if they want to do something (preferably something that you know they like or might be interested in doing) you can ask how they feel about something or if they like something you suggest or if they don't and then you can let them know what you think about it and especially! If you feel or think the same might just be the smallest spark to let them know that you both share opinions about things they didn't realize before. Then they might want to know what else you might share.

How do you control the anxiety you feel when you find it hard to trust someone?
I have trouble with anxiety all the time and with many things. My question is how well do you know these people that you're having a hard time trusting? Did they kinda burn you before when you trusted them and they let you down somehow? If that's the case, then I can understand why you are having trouble trusting them. If that's the case then I'd say don't give them any way by believing anything that they say. Assume that everything is a lie or embellishment. If they are strangers or an acquaintances then in my book they are trusted to a certain extent until they give reason for them not to be trusted. “Trust is everything, once that's broken, sorry means nothing “ I'm a forgiving person but hey “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me “ for failing for it again.

I recently read that on average most people are told between 10 to 200 lives lies per day! Everyone! Lies to a certain extent and is told lies. Some little white lies to consider someone's feelings or to embellish someone's character or assets! If you believe that your friends or relatives or whoever stab you in the back then I'd say find other friends and lose your current ones! Plus it also depends on how much you value your friendship and what you just cannot overlook. If they're just hurting you, it's probably time to move on.

I think I know exactly how you must be feeling and understand. Pretty much the same thing happened to me a few years ago. I talked to a professional and they told me that you must come to understand that the past up until now really means very little.

I definitely agree with that answer, however there used to be this old man neighbor of mine who had the sweetest cat and one day he told me that she didn't like him anymore. I figured out why.. he would get drunk and knock things over and break his stuff in his place and his cat would run and hide under his furniture for safety. The kitty feared for her life! And only was nice when he fed her. I had to tell him that, that was the reason.

Do you enjoy taking your anger out on others when you’re angry?
Absolutely not. Ive done it many times in the past. It only might seem ok at the time, however a little while later when I calmed down and was alone with my thoughts I wound up feeling terrible especially if I thought I was too excessive about it. I know at the time you might kinda have a feeling of determination or superiority but it fades quickly. I knew that I was very very angry and needed to do something about it and I thought it just wasn't going to go away and trying to ignore it wasn't healthy either so I looked for alternatives. I began walking and exercising and breaking stuff; plates, sunglasses, boards, punching bags and stuff and after a while it brought me back to rationally soon and I felt soooooo much better with no guilt

How do I tell my boyfriend that he deserves love?
So are you under the impression that he doesn't think he does deserve love or did he tell you that he doesn't deserve to be loved? I think there are several possible factors here. The way he was raised by parents or guardians who did not Express love or taught him that he was not worthy of love. As children we carry alot into adulthood because we never learned properly. It's also possible that he experienced severe psychological trauma in his past whether at an early age up until recently which might have had an effect on his perception of love or relationship or how one cares for others. There is one other far fetched and low disturbing thing and that is the idea of presenting a subject (like love) to draw you away from it only to offer a “solution “ to his problem by asking you for somet…

Is it wrong to feel as if this world isn’t for me? I think there’s something wrong with me. I feel more attached to a world that’s not real, or a fantasy, more than my daily life. Sometimes I even wish to live my life in that world.
I recently read that people who have trouble with this world as it is and find themselves more often in another place. A place that they fantasize about or somehow created in their minds is reportedly unhealthy for mental stability. Apparently the individual slowly begins to lose more and more touch with reality. I read that many psychiatrists consider this symptoms of psychosis. Which is a very serious mental disorder, where the person can be violent to others and themselves along with possible seizure. It is advised if you even think the slightest that its something that you're really concerned and scared about you should seek professional help as soon as possible and explain to them as much detail about what you think is going on.

Why do I feel awkward if someone does an awkward thing even though I did not contribute to nor am blamed for the awkwardness?
Well you possibly could feel that awkwardness because of your empathy for others and you tend to “put yourself in their shoes"" and have a very good understanding of how they feel by judging how you would feel in a similar or exact situation. If you are pretty much that way towards almost everything and everyone then you might possibly be what some people refer to as an (empath) def: very easy to pick up on someone's mood or emotions and begin to “feel"" the same. Understand? I am an empath and I'll tell you, it can be very good sometimes but sometimes I wish i wasn't this way because I tend to let more things get to me than others. The awkward thing with others around might not feel any awkwardness at all if it wasn't happening to them. Everybody deals with everything differently. Something…

People always told me no, and my expectations were always ruined. They always rejected me, and I felt okay with it, but I truly want what I want. Why do I always suffer?
Well it kinda sounds like to me that you're pretty used to getting your way with things. I think you also might have pretty high expectations of things you might want and then when you're let down not able to get it. It's quite a fall for you because you were really counting on having things your way. Well i don't know how old you are but get used to Not having your way ever! Then when things do happen to “workout” in your favor it will be better. Maybe some people in your circles also might know that you have been kinda spoiled about things and now maybe they desire to teach you some kind of lesson. I'm only guessing that. But i can tell you in the 52 years ive been around the block, life is a continuous vicious series of disappointments and let downs and when you do happen to have things…

What if your best friend knows that you like him?
I would pay very close attention to the way he treats you now, compared to before he knew and recognize the differences and the way he treats you. Is he paying more attention to you? Or less? Or the same? Have you noticed him finding reasons to touch you in a friendly way like touching your shoulder briefly or your knee or something like that. That my be a subtle unconscious way of letting you know how he feels. Most of the time your “best friend’ won't come right out and tell you how they really feel. I say “ most of the time” sometimes if the feeling is mutual he might let you know in no uncertain terms. I would also advise to be VERY careful, because if he doesn't feel the same then knowing how you feel about him might cause him to feel uncomfortable around you and it could cause the fr…

The man I've been dating (6 months) is having a woman friend stay with him for the weekend. How can I know if he's being honest about their dynamic?
Well, if this was the first and only time it happened I would tell you not to worry, however since this is like four or five times I would really begin to wonder. Something seems very fishy!! I wouldn't tryst him. I'd think he's probably sleeping with them, but keeping you on the line as a safety back up. Just my opinion. I could be totally wrong.

Everyone thinks I’m stupid and they say that they don’t trust me with anything yet, they make me do so many favors. What do I do?
Take a step back and observe the situation. See if your relationships/friendships are one sided or if it’s a mutual. Just take time for yourself and stop doing favors for people who are belittling you toxic behavior is draining and theirs no point take time for you and do things you like. If you want to try to work it out talk to them directly about if they shove it aside you’ll know what’s up

It’s been almost a week since my dog was spayed. Since then, she has barely eaten, barely drank, and is not acting like herself. A few days after surgery, she was vomiting and had diarrhea, but I think she’s empty now. What’s going on?
Take the dog back to vet please. Dang, not sure why that's so hard to figure out. Get off the internet and go to the vet before she dies.

Me to, on the job thing and I actually live in a motel. [ne I'm not sure ill not be able to pay the next day , everyday. Its a ss and I'm over it. For what I pay here I could be paying rent and actually eating every day. Food stamps? $281.00 isn't gonna feed anyone all month with the price of everything so high! Each item in the store costs average 5 bucks. It goes quick.
If one more person who has a home and a husband who pays their bills tells me to call 211 again I just may catch a case. I called 211 once years ago back when they actually funded helping the homeless. I wasn't homeless then but needed a food bank and all I got was a buncha bs.
So I am not calling 211 ever again, they don't have any help its just the government putting thing in place to look like that are doing something about all this, but they aren't and we know it. Its a game that they think we dont see, but we do and its BS.

I feel like this is a way for these men to pay back society for their wrong doings that landed them in prison for life . They are the only ones who can do this for society since they have nothing more to lose. I respect that to the highest point you can and that’s what it is. It is what it is. Fyi - I believe when they other prisoners get any kind of idea that someone may be in for these types of crimes they will call out the prisoner in question and make him prove what he is there for with his paperwork from court and what not and if he doesn’t - all bad. Obviously if he does and it’s a crime against kids and even women - same. All bad.

How could I reduce my nasolabial folds, increased by weight loss and sun damage (26 years old, 27 in September)?
I have them filled with an injectable filler. Juvederm Voluma I believe it was called. Works good. I feel like I could use a lot more of it but I have the area filled when another great way is to have to cheek areas filled in which the nasolabial folds are then effected by being pulled upward and that improves it greatly.

I used lime on my body when I had horrible mosquito bites that itched so bad and it helped a little but was so harsh so I would vote no using it on your face ! Though, I have heard of people using lemon for dark spots on the face. Which seems a bit harsh , as well. Maybe also depends on your skin type.

Is it worth it to spend $12,000 for dog treatment to prolong her life for at most 2 years, while also risking side effect of chemo therapy?
First and foremost negotiate a better price with your vet or look for a cheaper vet to do the same treatment. Care credit is good to put it on credit … if you qualify. Look up local charities that help pay this sort of thing you will just need your diagnosis and estimate for services and treatment unpaid for to apply . Once you pay they will not reimburse you. They make desisions fast for this reason. It’s worth it if you can make it happen! Try these options before saying no please.

Or try mixing it with Braggs Apple Cider vinegar ! Only use that brand as its all natural and is the best ! It will leave your face a bit redder than the mask with water will but it’s not a bad red it’s from how tight the mask gets etc but using with vinegar clears up skin fast and really makes the mask so much better! Aztec is the best! These days you can usually find it at CVS too!

Next time soak in hot bath to bring your veins out before you shoot up so you can clearly see them bulging out . Do not shoot up in the water and/or if you are super overheated, please. And if happen to miss again immediately take a hot rag and tie it around the area and pull tight for as long as you can and it will reduce the size of the miss significantly keep it on as long as possible to good luck.

Order them online from Amazon darling . 30/31 gauge is so much more comfortable and easier on the veins in the long run however they will clog much easier if you have thick dark blood and take to long to push in after you are registered because you are unsure if you are still in , etc etc . 5/16 is a short I do believe ? They make them shorter I call em bee stingers however I don’t think you can get those ones in a larger gauge than 30 or 31 ? And you definitely would have to find them online … they are good if you have a hard time pushing in without missing if your point isn’t fully in your vein but if you don’t have veins that are popping out good and fat then they may be too short for ya! Unless you are using them in your hands in which the veins are are all pretty close to the surface and popping up. Truly in the overall your best bet when it comes to worrying about a shorter needle and gauge etc it’s better to just actually be hydrated enough and hitting yourself correctly instead of trying to find a rig to accommodate these issues. Drink more water and be honest with yourself about how much you are drinking 8–10 glasses a day is for the normal non user so drink more than that which is like seemingly impossible but will change your life ! It takes two days to rehydrate after becoming dehydrated so if you wanna get back to right faster go to one of these spots that give you an iv for like 100 bucks or less out here the Botox clinics usually offer them and you can add supplements to them to and get an iv bag and you will be instantly rehydrated them from there don’t skip on your water consumption to maintain it. The nurse will know you use by looking at you arms or wherever you have veins even if you only shot up once I know that spot they always fucking know but remember she isn’t gonna rat you out esp if they are only at the Botox clinic but even at the hospital they won’t get you in trouble but they will note it in your med charts at the hospital only and from them on you will be treated differently at the hospital but I don’t recommend going to the er for an iv bag these days maybe a couple years ago but with Covid/ nah. Plus you would be wasting their time during a really bad time. Fuck covid. Good luck.

It’s been “fake “ for years meow. It’s made fully different with different ingredients than in the past as they cannot obtain the same orginal ingredients as before since USA outlawed them and obtaining them isn’t do able . Or maybe it’s not impossible but not even close to worth it. When’s the last time you heard of a lab getting busted or blown up out here ? Been years cause no one cooks meth anymore like that . Used to head it a few times a week.
I believe you can get most of them in China - so China has to be high as fuck is my guess . Maybe explains a lot of things these days . Soul less country. Gone are the days when the days were gone and the nights and so on.
As for the herion I dunno but from what I know they aren’t ducking with black anymore it’s the fenty and that shit is so cheap to make and the mark up is way up and it’s deadly as fuck so they step on it hard cause they can but then it gets stepped on and on again and again til it’s nada and no ones high just chasing a high ….best thing to do is what I did. Just quit . Isn’t worth it anymore and it isnt coming back but if it does lemme know. Not the heroin … could give two ducks about that trash.

My teen thinks vaping is no big deal, and that is better than smoking cigarettes? Aside from it being illegal for minors in my state, how can I convince her that nicotine is nicotine?
The banning of indulgences, such as nicotine free vapes, in of all things -public spaces- such as parks and restaurants is all the proof I require that the “Health of Others” argument against cigarettes is disingenuous to its core.
If second hand smoke smelled like roses I figure an easy three quarters of the anti smoking legislation would never have passed.
Nicotine or none, far too many members of the public -simply cannot abide witnessing others enjoy themselves-.

As people so often do with those they’ve just met, simple questions are asked, such as the nearly clichéd “Do you like music?”
I assume nearly all who are asked respond with “yes.”
I get the impression what most of those who answer actually mean “yes, I listen to music” or even worse, really mean “yes, I often HEAR music.”
I’m a third generation son that would reply with “Accurate home music reproduction capable of inspiring an emotional reaction like one should expect during a live performance is very important to me. Having audio equipment just good enough to demand one pay attention to and be moved by the music is one of those special things that makes a house feel like a home.”

""I am sitting in my cruiser typing a report. This woman just came up to me and asked me if she could talk to me for a second. I said, ‘Absolutely’ and got out of my cruiser to speak with her. The very first thing she said was, ‘Your life matters to me.’ She said, 'I don't see you as a ‘white cop’ rather, I see you as human... we are all human, and we are all the same.' She then asked me, ‘Could I give you a hug?’ Which I accepted. I told her, ‘Your life matters to me as well.’ We continued to chat for about twenty minutes about all that is going on in the world. During those twenty minutes… it wasn’t a cop and citizen… or a cop and a black citizen talking. It was just two humans having a conversation. Before she left, she gave me a small bible and told me, ‘I will be praying for you.’ We need more people in the world like this woman."" ❤️ Credit: John Rinn

Is Matthew 24:3-14 coming true?
Without a doubt :-) Jesus’ disciples asked him: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?” (v.3) In answer, Jesus foretold many things that would happen after he began ruling in heaven as King of God’s Kingdom. Some of these include war, food shortages, and earthquakes. Shortly after Jesus became King of God’s Kingdom, he went to war in heaven against Satan and the demons. Satan lost that war. The Bible says that “he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.” (Revelation 12,9 12) Satan is very angry because he knows he will be destroyed. So he causes pain and suffering all over the earth. No wonder world conditions are so bad! God’s Kingdom will soon undo all these problems.

Myself, would have been feeling very honored to be a part of the ones who were returning her back home. I am asking that after you read this thay we too, give a moment of silence to one of our fallen soldiers, Brooke Newton, United States Military Defense. ❤️May God be with her family.

“When we stopped at the terminal, the pilot announced that he would like to inform us that we were flying one of our fallen soldiers, Brooke Newton, home to her family. He asked that we remain on the plane until our soldier was removed from the plane first. He also asked that we give a moment of silence. As we sat there waiting, I decided to look out the window and this is what I saw. A mother and father hysterically crying on their fallen soldiers casket. Standing off to the side were soldiers from her unit saluting their fallen soldier. This moment hit me hard for some reason. I couldn't hold back tears. As I looked around the plane, I was hoping nobody would see my moment of weakness but to my surprise, damn near everyone on the plane was crying. The woman standing next to me was Muslim. She was in tears and she tried consoling the woman next to her. The plane was filled with people of all races and religions. It was amazing to see everyone on that plane pay tribute to this woman and her family. I saw no division on that plane last night. I saw Americans paying respect to their countryman. A woman who put her life on the line for me, and you, and your freedoms."" Author: Mike Helms

There are lessons in life, which we are to learn from, they’re all around us. We just have to look for them. Most of us can’t do that because our eyes are closed to only that which pertains to us. It appears that this world; this society we live in has evolved now to a point at which our mindset is that if it doesn’t benefit or help us in some sort of way, then why do it?
In 1871 Descent of Man, Charles Darwin stated baldly that ""man is descended from a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits."" He also maintained that the difference between the mind of man and that of a chimpanzee or gorilla is a matter of degree, not of kind.
Theologically speaking we all know this not to be true. For those who do believe the theory of Charles Darwin, assume that we became into existence in this manner, then it seems like we have turned back into how we became. We seem to be living in a dog-eat-dog world 🌎. If Charles Darwin was still alive I’m sure he would be proud!

this is the first I’ve read about actually forgiving and how we are to do so. Thank you thank you for publishing it.

How does one forgive someone who is not sorry?
First of all, it is not easy! It may end up being a long story. There are things you do because you need to. User-12587938673421367804 gave a colossal example of a gold coin sucking machine, It is evident that we all know that we need to forgive to be at peace. The question is ""How do we do that?"". Someone you loved like a maniac hurt you, cut your emotions in pieces and fed them to fishes. And they are still not sorry about it. According to them, They were right and didn't do anything wrong. They'd say they never asked you to love them so much. It is your fault. It is your fault that they hurt you. They hurt you because you deserved it. And then, you have the daunting task of forgiving them. How do you do that? I found this on Google: How to Forgive This is a wikiHow link on forgiving people. I found it really amusing. The first paragraph goes like this ""One of the thorniest and most difficult things we humans are ever called upon to do is to respond to evil with kindness, and to forgive the unforgivable. We love to read stories about people who have responded to hatred with love, but when that very thing is demanded of us personally, our default seems to be anger, angst (dread or anguish), depression, self-righteousness, hatred, etc. Yet study after study shows that one of the keys to longevity and good health is to develop a habit of gratitude and let go of past hurts."" I personally feel that forgiving people takes practice. It is a habit you have to build. Think of it as hitting the gym everyday. You try and try until you finally get over it. Only then, have you forgiven the other person. * First and foremost, accept what has happened. There are things you cannot control and there are instances which hurt you like a cannon, but they have happened. Whining or shouting about them wont help your cause. I suggest, you shout for a few days. You need to experience everything as a human being. Same goes for failure. You must experience what it feels like to fail at forgetting people. You will be reminded of them everyday, and you will learn to live with it. Until then, feel the angst, the anger, the pain which failure inflicts on you. Think as much as you want to about them, and one day, you will realise that it is of no use. It does not matter what you think about them. Time did not stop while you were busy reflecting on what had happened. * Once you feel that it does not matter anymore, you have succeeded in building a habit to ignore that particular emotion. Mind my words, it will always be there, it is just that you now ignore it with ease. It was new initially but now, it is a habit. * Lets talk about breakups. An ugly one actually. You invested so much, and one fine day, you see all your investments failing. All the fake promises the broker made that you'd get your return. It is like the stock market crashed one fine morning. You could see your money doubling almost everyday, but one fine sunny morning, the stock market crashes. What now? You have two options, either cry about the money you lost for the rest of your life or make more money, invest again and hope.. ""HOPE"". Batman teaches you a lot of things. One of them is Hope. You hope to live, You hope to survive. Your hopes are what fuel your life. * You hope you get a return this time. But make sure you do not hope for gold coins from that gold coin sucking machine. Do your homework first, and then invest. Investing in the titanic if you know it has vulnerabilities beforehand but hoping that it would survive is stupidity. You already know it is bound to go down, yet you invest? * SO, How do you let go? You learn to let go. You read, you think, you give it time. That is how a normal human being lets go. You make a list. PROS AND CONS. You know you have to forgive to lead a better life. So, give it time, give it energy. Let it flow. Let all the negative emotions flow. It will soon be okay. HOPE. NEVER lose hope. Soon, you realise that they don't matter, neither do their actions anymore. That is when you are ready to forgive. Until then, You have a battle waging inside but, It is worth it. The experience is worth it. I follow the philosophy that ""The troubles I faced were worth every penny when it comes to the person I became.""

Does Sephora really throw away ""used"" returns?
It would be highly unhygienic to resell/put items back on the shelf. Sephora is generous with samples I assume most people ask for samples before purchasing a certain product.

My sons do not allow me or my daughter to wear skirts that reveal the skin because it’s against their beliefs. They were both normal until both of them became unorthodox Hindus under a fake scholar. What should I do?
I can understand actually. Some of my older friends also are prohibited by their husband or sons about not only casual dress or make up to wear. Some belief is too fundamentalist to be true that some people in some culture believe that women is under responsibility of men in their family. If some women did violate some rules they believe to be foundation of their religion, men can be sent to hell to bear that called sin.
The solver is you have to discuss with your sons.

Do I forgive my boyfriend for only hitting me once?
This is already classified as physical violence and normally it will be repeated. Do you want to be hit? As a mom I suggest you to end up this relationship. If you have something precious, will you hit it? You will keep it and guard it right. Even if he appologise later its still bad sign.

Oh my I'm like this in every situation, for example, when I'm asking (I'm in a good mood) and they answered (like they are poker face or not happy) I always thought and feel that i've done wrong that made them talk to me like that even though they never said anything to me. And I will always thinking it for like 2 to 3 days, until I arrived at a conclusion of “what if they just not in a mood (not because of me) or had a bad day.

A healthy man whose brother has Down Syndrome got married with a healthy woman. How much is the possibility for the couple to have a baby with Down Syndrome?
the same possibility that someone who’s brother does not have Down syndrome. It is not always genetic. It is an extra chromosome. A toss of the dice, if you will. I was in my late 20s as was my husband. We were not related at all, even centuries back. We have both had typical children as well. None of our nieces or nephews have Down Syndrome. No one in our families have had children with Down syndrome. I remember, in 9th grade, I took biology. We were learning about genetics and had little pieces of paper with traits on them. We would randomly throw them on the table and see what combinations happened. That is basically the way it can happen.works.

How did ""children should be seen and not heard"" work out as a parenting strategy?
It doesn’t and never has. My mom said this all the time. I took a seminar while working in childcare, The first thing asked was if anyone was told this phrase as children? They said that this the opposite of what to think. Children need to learn to be a healthy adult. If someone doesn’t value their opinion or answer their questions, they will not be able to function well in the real world. How can a well adjust individual come from a childhood of being silenced? While children are experiencing the world, their brain is forming. If children are treated poorly or feeling invaluable, their brain is literally changing. We learn what we live.

How does having step-parents help during divorces for kids?
At the time of my divorce, it was a complicated situation, and I could not see a positive at all. Now that my children are older, I do see the benefits step parents have. They get more people to love them (in non toxic situations) they gain other people to confide in. They see people can move on after a fight, when co parenting is done properly. Sometimes they gain a parental figure, if they were not given that from their original parent. It’s also positive when they keep in touch with a stepfamily even if that relationship ends as well. It teaches bonding can happen even when blood is not a factor. Anyone who support, protect, and love children, are a plus!

What are some things a parent can do for their children after a divorce?
Be cordial with co parents. No matter how much disdain you have, do not model it to your children. Their parent is a part of them, therefore, if they see you do not like the parent, they may feel you don’t like part of them. Obviously, if it’s an unsafe situation, this is not as relevant. Another thing is stability, and keeping routines etc as same as possible. Don’t ever make children pick sides! Even as an adult it is hard to feel like you have to plan around parent hostility. Show love, be a soft place to fall and reassure them it is not their fault.

a couple of movies I’ve seen that are hard to watch were, the woodsman with Kevin Bacon and Lolita. Lolita was very hard to read as well. I don’t understand how people associate the term Lolita with a seductive girl. She tries to get away, and is obviously being abused. Another film is Precious based on the book push by Sapphire. Oh and the movie Splice’s ending was just, no…

What an oddly defensive answer for a completely logical and reasonable question…
SN: Guinea tee and Dago tee are also colloquial synonyms for a sleeveless tank top; although they are ethnic slurs against Italian immigrants. I guess making comedic light of ethnic slurs and domestic violence are just inherent to American culture.

As a medical professional, I have to disagree. Race and ethnicity are not interchangeable. The only questions (that are scientifically-based) are used to determine the prevalence of a genetically linked disease or disorder.
An example is the question concerning if a patient has Ashkenazi ethnic heritage; which is linked to the prevalence of the BRCA gene in breast cancer testing.
Additionally, the fact that there are diseases that are prevalent in certain demographics is accurate. However, race is not the causation of the prevalence of certain diseases. This is a common misconception, and one that is continually being debunked. Socioeconomic factors (i.e. racial wealth gap, living environments, microaggressions, etc.) are the causation.
Ethnicity has a genetic link. Race does not; it’s an identity. Often the two are conflated, but there is a distinction for vital reasons. Preventing a resurgence of eugenics is one of them.

To masquerade as if a particular religion has had no negative impact or ill-will on the world is extremely irresponsible. If you are going to list the beneficence, then list the negatives as well. A one-sided view is problematic and prevents individuals from seeing a complete truth.
If the truth is important, we must recognize that the racism (both personal and institutional) of Brigham Young and the LDS/Mormon church founded the beliefs and practices to both institute cultural assimilation of groups of people (mostly POC; e.g. Nigeria, South Africa, Fiji, Brasil) and limitations/segregation placed upon them such as prohibition against fully participating in the religion and inter-marriage (i.e. “gospel” that was rescinded by Kimball based on people of color not being accepted into the priesthood or being allowed to racially inter-marry until 1978/79 because of the “curse of Cain”).
All of this is highly ironic considering that the actual founder Joseph Smith was more forward-thinking, yet the masses got behind his successor Brigham Young, who was arguably publicly racist as demonstrated by many of his written works (i.e. Journal Of Discourses). To choose to name a university after such a man (as opposed to the actual founder) is beyond my analysis/rationalization.
If Mormonism didn’t exist, quite a bit of emotional turmoil and distress experienced by people of color, as well as any other demographic(s) affected would not have occurred. E.g. Prop 8: The proposition formerly passed in California that denied marriage to rightful adult individuals; another highly ironic stance given the history of Mormonism’s alternative lifestyle arrangement: polygamous marriage.
If Mormonism didn’t exist, LGBT suicide rates would not be elevated in LDS communities (as compared to the rate in the general public) and these individuals might still be alive:
Carlyle Marsden, Stuart Matis, D.J. Thompson, Clay Whitmer, Bryan Michael Egnew, Jack Denton Reese, Harry Fisher, Lincoln Parkin, Braxton Taylor, Stockton Powers, and other unnamed individuals.
Your statement concerning the good that your church has done is accurate. Just as my statement concerning the bad that your church has done is accurate.
In summation, the truth is vital. Don’t spread partial truths…
SN: I use the word “lifestyle” satirically because polygamy was a religious belief as compared to gay marriage which is an embodiment of an individual’s pursuit of happiness based upon a religion institution that is recognized by the state for financial reasons [IRS]. An organization shouldn’t be tax-exempt if it is involved in political lobbying and for-profit ventures but that’s a whole other rabbit hole…

It shouldn’t take courage to point out a mistake that could potentially cause harm to or terminate a life. While I understand your position based on the unhealthy work atmospheres that exist in some medical centers, it is still an unfortunate and disconcerting reality that exists. If most patients knew that hospitals generally have training to combat work conditions in which providers make it taboo for staff to identify errors, they would be rather disturbed.disturbed. It would be preferred if egos were checked at the door prior to entering the medical arena. Too many overblown egos have resulted in injury or death.

Is the answer to the meaning of life really 42?
Here are just several of my postulations… In pop culture there is an excerpt in the book “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” that states the meaning of life: ""The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is 42."" The author however, wrote it in jest. Another theory is rooted in Kabbalah, the number 42 is believed to be the number with which God created the universe. The number 42 holds a significant place in mathematics, science, technology, astronomy, and (as stated above) religion, among other fields. There is also an article in The Independent (although some answers are purely satirical): 42: The answer to life, the universe and everything Wikipedia also has a decent reference page: 42 (number) - Wikipedia (Disclaimer: With all things Wikipedia, I approach the inf…

Of course it’s not wrong to want sex if your wife won’t give you any. But wanting doesn’t mean getting it. On the other hand, if you’re constantly being rejected or feel unfulfilled and there are no medical issues, go to therapy. If she resists or the therapy goes nowhere, she’s likely using sex as a weapon to control you or she’s just too messed up mentally, or both. If that’s the case, just end the marriage. Otherwise, it will wear you down, erode your self-worth, and eventually destroy you. It will happen slowly, until you wake up one day and realize what’s happened to you. That will be a sad day. Good luck brother!

How can Ukraine ever be stable when western and eastern Ukraine differ linguistically, religiously, culturally, historically, and in its desire to join NATO? Wouldn’t it make more sense if they were two separate countries?

Yes, they are. Introverts suffer in this extroverted world. It’s time extroverts feel a little pain.

What do schizophrenic voices say?
As someone who has experienced hearing voices for about 12 years (they started when I was about 14), they can say a range of things. Some days they are quiet whispers which comment on what I’m doing or saying. On other days, especially when I’m feeling anxious, they are very derogatory towards myself and other people. One of my main warning signs that I’m becoming unwell is a change in frequency and volume of my voices. They can also become quite demanding and tell me to do things I wouldn’t normally do when I am becoming more unwell. In answer to your question - they can literally say anything! And I think the nature of the voices will vary from person to person :)

Janet, I know this is like over a year since you posted this comment, but did you start your period around 12 or around the same time? In talking with alllll my doctors, therapists, psychologists, friends, family, etc. I believe there's a connection, at least in my case. I started my period right around, before, I had my first anxiety attack & then the picking. There has to be some kind of connection. Interested if yours came very close together like mine..

Thank you. I have dermatillomania, or excoriation disorder, or Obsessive skin picking disorder. Why must it have so many damn names!?!? I appreciate this post, cuz for me, it's so humiliating, embarrassing, depressing, lonely & so on & so on.. I'm sorry you have this as well, cuz I know the absolute hell of it. But it's nice to know I'm not alone. Ya know?
For people who don't understand, which it can be part of OCD, body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety, depression, but it's mainly a bfrb if I'm correct. Bodily focused repetitive behavior. Imagine what it's like to literally mutilate yourself & not be able to stop. “Just stop picking”… like, “no shit Sheila!!??? Really? That's IT?? Well I'll be dammed, Sheila. Why didn't I think of that before!?!?”
I have a long list of diagnoses as far as mental health, which I am going to be requesting an appointment with a neuropsychologist to basically “review” & ideally, drop 1 or 2..
If I could get rid of one of my mental illnesses, I would get rid of the dermatillomania. Even over being a drug addict (or with substance ab/use disorder to be PC or whatever). Hands down, not a single ounce of doubt, I would choose dermatillomania.
Lastly, Just cuz I feel like you will understand this,this, my last thing is about my therapist/coping skills. She has suggested fidget toys, specifically the fidget cube. It's really cool & I do use it. I even bring it to my daily production meetings at work & while driving. She also suggested Crazy Aaron's thinking putty, which is great for when I'm watching TV at night (don't fall asleep with it in your hand though.. saying it was a mess is a huge understatement lol). So my point is, yes, I can make use of these things, however my picking is almost always, or starts out as, totally subconscious, so making a conscious decision to use a fidget toy, can be difficult. And honestly, there's times when I just WANT to f*cking pick!!! Which I know I will regret & hate myself for, but in that moment, I truly do not care. When picking has been my unconscious coping skill for over 22 years, it can be very discouraging & hard to really work at this, when I just don't see it changing.¶

Thanks again

Does Adderall make anyone else super horny? I've just started back on a 30mg dose twice a day and I'm so super horny every time I take it.
Definitely! I'm practically horny all the time without it, but I get to a whole new extreme when I take adderall. I think I'm borderline to becoming a sex addict. Tomorrow marks exactly 3 years clean from meth (& heroin) & one of the reasons I fell in love with meth is cuz of how horny it made me, plus no inhibitions & the absolutely most intense, best, mindblowing orgasms!! It's like adderall x 1,000. So anyway, you're not alone! Do you like it or no though?

I totally second the seroquel! Thorazine is probably the best in my opinion though, or Haldol! Both can be pretty strong depending on mg. Technically both are psych meds, anti-psychotics actually, so they are pretty much meant to bring you down. I know I used to go crazy towards the end of my binges & during the comedown, so maybe that's why I like it. Now I'm gonna contradict myself a little.. BE CAREFUL!!! I overdosed on a mixture of meth & seroquel & ended up being in a coma for 4 days. However, that was after about a 15 day long binge, roughly 1 hours sleep, no food, lots of factors.

My husband sent my 7-year-old step-son to boarding school because I dislike him. However, he comes back for a month during vacation. How can I limit his vacation time as much as possible?
My heart goes out to your step-son who might be feeling rejected! Waooo you dislike a 7 years old boy? What are your reasons for disliking a child? Has the boy become a tyrant because you deprived him of his fatherly love, touch, and care? Your actions and or inactions as a step-parent is probably making the 7 years old child feel emotionally rejected. Are you aware of the extensive damage you’re doing to the boy’s emotional wellbeing? If ever that boy turns to drugs or other maladaptive behaviors as coping mechanism, either now or later in his adult life; You are to be blamed. It is your responsibility as a step-parent to nurture and guide your husband’s son lovingly, after all you knew he has a son before marrying him. I pray you would make efforts to redefine your role as a wife with ki…

What do people get wrong about Russians?
Ah! The author of this question could have added … “and what do people get right about Russians”! WHAT’S WRONG WITH RUSSIANS: From personal worldview! In 2017 I was badly bullied at work by a Russian lady: Tatiana. We worked together at a Psych hospital in Plano TX. I’m (almost) positive that Tatiana was used by the unit’s administrators and supervisor, so they can find fault to fire me. Sadly, it’s not uncommon for unwary highly skilled nurses to be used by unscrupulous healthcare systems, who hires highly skilled nurses just to meet JAHCO’s requirements. Such was the case when a hospital at Plano Texas, USED A RUSSIAN lady to try and fire me after completion of their JAHCO inspections!

Who are INFJs?
There are so many traits that decipher an INFJ. To me, INFJs are like the Prophets described in many religious scriptures. However, common condition peculiar to INFJs are: Feelings of not belonging to this world: I am INFJ, and therefore I question myself secretly, whether or not I am an ALIEN! It’s not uncommon for INFJ to feel lost here on earth, as we try to understand or find meanings to human behaviors i.e injustice, and lack of mercy. But those of us who are spiritually inclined have the awareness of what I can call Nirvana, a heavenly awareness, but not heavenly as some religion would suggest or make us to believe. But the Nirvana I'm trying to suggest is a sacred place within our souls where we go to find peace and rest. Most INFJs enters into this type of Nirvana at regular interv…

When I was younger, I never thought I'll one day be lonely. But now in my 60s, I am pondering what life would be like in my 80s. Family disintegration is big issue. I've nursed hundreds of lonely elderly patients whose experiences frightens me more!
Humans: instructions 🧠📋 · May 2, 2022
A letter from an elderly woman from a nursing home.
I am 82 years old, I have 4 children, 11 grandchildren, 2 great-grandchildren and a room of 12 square meters. I no longer have a home or expensive things, but I have someone who will clean my room, prepare food and bedding, measure my pressures and weigh me. I no longer have the laughter of my grandchildren, I don't see them growing, hugging and arguing. Some come to me every 15 days, some every three or four months, and some never. I no longer work in the winter, I don't bake cakes, I don't dig up the garden. I still have hobbies and I like to read, but my eyes quickly hurt. I don’t know how much longer, but I have to get used to this loneliness. Here at home, I lead group work and help those who are worse than me as much as I can. Until recently, I read aloud to an immobile woman in the room next to me, we used to sing together, but she died the other day. They say life is getting longer. Why? When I’m alone, I can look at photos of my family and memories I brought from home. And that's all. I hope that the next generations will understand that families are born to have a future (with children) and that they do not forget about the family even in old age. Please don't show this to my children. Grandma Maria loves you.

Why are a lot of Nigerians so extroverted, fun, and friendly compared to other countries?
I don't think any of us (Nigerians) can fully explain why we are “so extroverted”, or why we are fun loving people. But I’ll start by saying; we are a highly spirited people (highly spirit spirited but not in any religious context) Traditionally, Nigerians tends to project positive energies everywhere we go, that might be based on our awareness of life’s impermanency. Hence we seize every opportunity to enjoy. As Yorubas (a Nigerian tribe) says “ibi aiye bani, lati nje” meaning “we should enjoy life wherever we finds life”. Hence we enjoy life whether at home in Nigeria or in diaspora. However, I find this Quora question interesting because, as a Nigerian diaspora myself, I have observe that the innate extroversion traits in many Nigerians can also be overbearing, I've learnt to “tone it down a bit”. The distinctive high energy we (Nigerians) have, aren't common to many other Africans. Unfortunately our extroversion traits does pose some challenges because, some non-Africans tends to compare us with other laid-back African people. Hence Nigerians can be judged as being “too loud” or too frivolous, which might cause some Nigerians to become conditionally introverted. In saying that, it seems the author of this Quora question is fascinated by our Nigerian charismatic traits, for this reason I'd like to say that, extroversion is in Nigerian’s DNA. Ability to create happiness in the midst of, or after any calamity is innately Nigerian. We allow ourselves to grief over a loss, but we can quickly get over our grieving, and we compose ourselves, as we move forward recounting our everyday blessings. When something bad happens, there’s a common slogan used by the Yorubas to console themselves; “mi o le wa ku” or “mi o le para mi” meaning “I won’t die” or “I can’t kill myself”
Not just the Nigeria…

Every country have its dark hole of poverty, inequalities is a global epidemic. Most harrowing perhaps is the sad effects of socioeconomic disparities in many developed countries. Such situation whereby (none-existing) middle class people will shout victory for living side-by-side with the super rich and famous ones. Yet, we all know that both middle class and the blue color (working class) still struggles to feed their status quo. They're burdened with huge personal loan debts and repayments: mortgage, car loans, designer wears etc.etc. Things have changed for the worst. Although middle class and working class might not necessarily be seen as poor, they do have financial struggles. Some white and blue color workers must keep 2 or more jobs to keep up their appearance with the Joneses. In affluent nation, life’s routine is typically more debts, more work, more stress. Salaries are no more sufficient to meet the demands of dreamy “well-to-do” lives. These folks suffer stress, just as the poor Nigerian; stress is stress. In IMO, all their efforts serves to keep making the rich richer. It’s easy to see some similarity in socioeconomic stresses between western middle/working class and those Nigerian guys hawking goods along the roads. Hence the conclusion that all countries have dark hollows of poverty and socioeconomic disparities.
One thing some Nigerians should be grateful for is not being offered personal loans to cure poverty, and deprivations. Of course, not having financial loans keeps the poor locked into poverty. But, imagine the middle-class racing around in the vicious circles of debt repayments, so much so some will wind up in retirement without money: just like their Nigerian counterparts. High rate of poverty is not geographically isolated to Nigeria; the entire world seems to be evolving with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. But one thing must be noted; most poor Nigerians are their own enemies! What do we expect from a political system where people kept selling their valuable votes to corrupt politicians? It’s the poor among us that often flock to the voting poles during elections, they elect unproductive politicians back into power? They choose to elect corrupt politicians who embezzles their constituency’s allocations, and enrich themselves with the national cake. We all know this to be true, but it’s a bitter truth. Speaking from personal experience in Nigeria politics; My good intention to improve lives of my constituency’s electorates, was cut short by the same electorates. How? I refused to buy vote, or pay for voters! Sadly, my electorates chose to vote long standing politicians who (as I later discovered) planted 1000 Naira in loafs of bread which was handed out to people just around polling stations!
Nigeria as a country cannot change herself, rather its Nigerians who must responsibility for changing the nation. Until the grassroots Nigerians stop selling their votes, transformation and improvement of citizens will remain a myth. Voting same politicians over and over, is like doing the same thing and expect to get a different result: Thats the definition of insanity, surely we can see such madness in our leaderships.
Adjacent to the spot where this photo was taken are multi-million pounds houses, and business. I this same unsightly presence of poverty everywhere I go in the world, it speaks volume.

Do you have to be competitive to be successful?
Anyone who’s studied in the UK and have opportunity to study in the USA can confirm the huge differences in educational systems of both countries. My preference is always going to be the UK. From my personal experience being African who lived in the UK for years, and later USA; Academic competitiveness in America is set to fail some, rather than succeed. From my observations in America, becoming successful at anything requires more than competitions; your face must fit the cap! For example, a mean racially biased professor can destroy a highly intelligent foreign student just because he or she can, i.e give a degrading grade. I am speaking from personal experience of a nasty racially biased nursing professor who (constantly) failed me in my Doctor of Nursing Practice program. She blatantly…

What are some examples of human cruelty?
Ignoring the causes, consequences, and effects of Socioeconomic disparities are examples of human cruelty! Over several generations, humanity continue to evolve around “the poor getting poorer, and the rich getting richer” Whilst I agree with the notion that; we all cannot be at the top, some of us must be at the bottom to sustain those at the top of social strata; the inequality gaps continues to be deepened. In my own opinion, this is the bases for all other cruelties against humanity. Cruelty against humans occurs when the rich and powerful exploits poor and vulnerable people. I believe socioeconomic inequality is driven by certain systems which fosters i.e. ridiculously low minimum wages in the face of high cost of living, and gross inflation. Another example is manufacturing goods (de…

Money ritual killings in Nigeria. This level of heartlessness is quite prevalent in my country, we hope and pray that it ends sooner than later. Unfortunately I wasn't prepared for what I heard when I discussed my answer on human killings for money ritual with some Nigerians. They opinionated that; Nigeria is not isolated in killing humans for many rituals, they argued “it’s occurring in other countries, just not done same way it’s done in Nigeria …”. I disagree with them, I have never heard of any country where people are captured, killed, decapitated, and the body parts can be used for money rituals, only in Nigeria.

Would my hardened heart soften if I started obeying God?
Your question is not pellucidly clear, but I’ll try to answer. NO! no one else can help you transform your hardened heart except YOU! BTW, with what parameter do you measure a hardened heart vs soften heart? Have you been influenced by religious teaching? Or, could you have been influenced by religious categorization of characters, and or behavioral parameters to conclude that your heart is hardened? Is your heart hardened because you're struggling with certain unresolved internalized issues that has led you to make wrong choices, or do wrong things? Or are you a hard hearted, strong willed, non-conformist person? In all these, the only god who can help you soften your heart or change anything about yourself, or your heart is yourself!

How did Britain colonize Nigeria without any form of resistance?
*** There was no global power tosses as is today, no nuclear weapon threats at that time! So, there was no threats to the Britain colonials. Inhabitants of the catchment the geographical areas called Nigera had no Nigeria Army to resist: no AK 47, no weaponry of any class to confront Britain’s invasion! All they had then were traditional-locally made machetes, arrows, and other types of tools they either used for farming or self defense. *** The then Nigerians, were naive (allow me to ignorant) enough to fall into religious brainwash, and all other manipulative strategies.

What are some psychological facts about love?
Amazingly we all think love is what or how one feels about another person. But there’s no better psychology to describe love except that LOVE IS AN ACTION WORD, not just an expression of feelings. Love is what we do when we truly show a person we love and care for them. Love goes beyond those instantaneous gratification of how we feel about a person. Rather it’s the actions that we’re compelled from deep within us to influence, and empowered the other person to feel loved. In other words, you don’t just love because you feel something strange in your mind, rather you give love by loving intentionally! However, this proposition requires one to be selfless by putting other people first before oneself: that’s what is missing in many relationships! As humans, to feel loved impacts our souls (p…

Why do I enjoy seeing my dad beat my mom?
Oh no! To enjoy seeing someone, particularly your mom being abused is a sign of personality disorder and or narcissistic personality; that isn’t a good sign at all! I’m not sure what your age is, but it worth asking yourself these questions: Do you suffer from psychological problems, or diagnosed with mental health problems? Were you abused by your mom? Do you suffer bullying at school? Are you bully, did you suffer bullying at school? In answering these questions by yourself might give you some insight to why enjoy seeing your mom being traumatized. The possibility of your hatred towards your mom seems abnormal, not being sympathetic to your mom’s agony, is a pointer to your own hidden wickedness. It is advisable that you acquaint yourself with Hitler, and take necessary step to seek psyc…

Why do Nigerians dominate Twitter?
Pardon me for answering this question with a question: WHY shouldn't Nigerians dominate Twitter? To answer original question; Nigerians are bold, fearless and non-conformists. Nigerians by nature would challenge any governmental maladministration. Prior to age of technology, we did not have a way to express our dissatisfactions, any other means may render one to be arrested, imprison, or killed. Such was the case when the late military dictator called Abacha killed innocent people. who dare to criticize his regime, including imprisonments or killings of journalists and activists. Therefore, Twitter and other social platforms provides opportunity for Nigerians who are socially and politically versatile. Nigerians don’t just dominate Twitter, but they dominates Instagrams, Facebook etc.. Bec…

What's wrong with East Africa? Why can't Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti prosper and see peace?
Bottomline, the reasons why some countries in East Africa can't have peace or prosperity is the evil of “Divide to conquer” Sadly this strategy is there to keep countries countries subjugated by the west! Thankfully, technology and New World system is changing and reducing the powers of separatism. However, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, and Djibouti must be awakened to the impacts of covert external powers that’s keeping them fighting against each other, thereby impending them from prospering. These East African countries must be aware of the effect, impact, and the consequences of “Divide to conquer” strategy to exploit their wealth etc. “What’s wrong with East Africa…?” Nothing! Nothing is wrong with East Africa, that’s not common to the rest of Africa continent. My great grandfather told u…

Why was Hitler so cruel?
Updated:¶

If Hitler was “so cruel”, what do we call those wicked people in Ukraine who cruelly suffers immigrants/African students living in Ukraine during this ongoing Russia-Ukraine war? How do we quantify or justify the inhumane handling of African students during Ukraine Ukraine’s foreign students during 2022 war outbreak (see the article articles below)? What can explain the wickedness being shown to Black race African and Indians in Ukraine during its Russian invasion war? Did you know that the west, western media and news outlets did not cover or mention anything about foreigners in Ukraine particularly Africans? Ukraine? Wouldn't it be nice to know how Ukraine’s immigrants are faring during the war? Why are Black Africans foreign students being held back in a war turn country against their wish? In the articles below, African and Indian students are being treated with hostility, they’re being turned back at the same borders where Ukrainians are entering as refugees. Report shows that many African Ukraine foreign students were tormented at the borders as they were while trying to flee the war? Can anyone explain the difference differences between how Africans are treated the cruelty against Ukraine’s foreign students, and the favoritism of Ukrainians above Ukraine’s immigrant, and how Hitler treated the Jews? Sadly, Hitler’s spirit lives on in this new world!. It’s a matter of time, and a replica of Hitler will emerge; someone who will be hugely preoccupied with eliminating Black Race cruelty against other race in this new world. Discrimination and cruelty against Africans in Ukraine Ukraine’s immigrants/students at a time such as this, is unwarranted! After all, Ukrainians Ukraine claims to be warring with Russia in favor of democracy, and we know that the west is supporting Ukraine. Ukraine to achieve this. So then how does neglecting the needs of a particular race (Africans) in Ukraine during ongoing Ukraine’s immigrants/students during Russia-Ukraine war depicts democracy? The answers to these questions are obvious; systemic racism at the core of our new world! I hereby rest my case.
Ukraine conflict: Nigeria condemns treatment of Africans
Nigeria condemns reports that citizens of African countries have been stopped from leaving Ukraine.
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-60555650
To answer your question, Hitler is said to be cruel because he was insanely unwell i.e. it is believed he was schizophrenic. I disagree with such insinuation. Other school of taught judged Hitler’s desire to be the greatest man that ever lived, as the precursor of his wickedness. This also goes to Hitlers efforts to make Germany the greatest country in the world. Hitler’s ideologies are said to have stemmed from being bullied right from his early start in life, consequently Hitler’s good side was thwarted to narcissism later in his life. IMO; anyone, country, or system that permits, facilitates or enables killings of humans are modern day Hitlers! PERIOD!

Israel Defense Forces: What do US soldiers think of the Tavor rifle? IMI Tavor TAR-21
I asked my US friend who served in the IDF infantry, he was issued different varients of the micro tavor:
“Mushy trigger and the gun is heavier than it needs to be. Also the bolt is heavy. I've switched multiple times between M4, M16, and the standard issue micro tavor.
The micro tavor also carries better and makes riding in a vehicle with a long-gun (read: rifle) more comfortable.
I'd prefer a civilian modern AR15 home build customised for mission requirements. (For example long barrel/short barrel, flashlight/laser attachment, countless kinds of buttstock changes, forward grip etc.
Micro tavor is better suited for full auto fire due to its weight and design, however, the IDF is a defence force which only uses fully automatic weapons fire in the most extreme of situations.”

‘Please, don’t hate Jews. We’re decent people.
But please, critique and speak out when anyone goes off the rails.’
Couldn't agree more.
I might add, many of the community who have supported people convicted of abuse have been similarly blinded by whomever is pulling the strings and assume they are helping out a person they believe is rightous and innocent. They could have been told the victim is lying and trying to harm the image of the accused because of ‘mental illness'.

The English name for mail ruach is trophy system. The merkava 4 barak will have the ‘iron vision', helmets with realtime view of the surroundings similar to pilots helmets. If I remember correctly, However, only the commander and the driver will wear them while the loader and gunner rest of the crew will stick with regular junteksjunteks. I wish they'd give it to the rest of the crew though, or at least the gunner and driver (I understand how the loader needs to pay attention to the inside more than the outside and it would be a massive distraction but I'm sure that could be worked around too).

This is the second time I've heard the markava has a toilet aboard. I'm in the IDF and work with the merkava 4m every day. I've never heard anyone mention a toilet. I know you can remove part of the read area to fit a squad of infantry, but my experiences in war week during training make me certain there's no toilet. Otherwise no way I'd have gone in a bag in my helmet.

3 seconds- gas grenade launcher less than a foot from me.
4 seconds- my handy leatherman on my belt with 2 different knife attachments plus a saw attachment which could do some serious damage.
5 seconds- a pretty wicked knuckleduster in my pocket.
6 seconds- any of the 3 other M16′s within reach.

There they planned and created DA, but it's not so interesting, maybe you mean the Room of Requirements? There they had all the meetings and the practice takes place there.

How can I join IDF?
Contact them.
Its called mitnadvim mi’chul (volunteers from abroad) or ‘machal’, you can find their phone number with a simple google search.
They’ll tell you to go to Israel and make you an appointment to bring some documents with you to their offices in tel aviv and have a short interview.
Then they'll make you an appointment at the draft office, there's a few around the country.
It can take a couple of months, keep calling and annoying the office if you'd like it to go faster.
Good luck

I've seen some of the most beautiful views imaginable, I've learnt to appreciate all the small things in life, from the sensation of being full from simple meals to the quiet moments of relaxation. I appreciate my bed (even the floor of the bus isn't so bad), I appreciate nice tasting drinks, the feeling after an exercise when my body can relax and heal. I appreciate the people who are with me 24 hours a day, we support each other, we know personal weaknesses and know when someone needs a hand. Knowing that you can trust the people your around whenever you really need them is a great feeling.¶

I started my service with boys who are now men. We've learnt responsibility and we've learnt how to get dressed really fast.
I hope that answers …

What does it feel like to take part in Israel's mandatory military service?
I'm currently serving in the IDF, in the tanks division and almost at the end of basic training! I wasn't born here and didn't speak the language when I arrived a couple of years ago (still not so good at that). That does complicate things when receiving orders and communicating with others but it's slowly improving. This does help give me perspective as to how Israelis feel about serving. There is a vast spectrum of views and I can generally separate them into different sections of the army. They ask you about your motivation both before joining (at your initial interview) and when you arrive at your unit and thats probably why I can see the differences per places. There's always people at the start complining and moaning about how awful it is and how they wish they could get out, they eithe…

How can you prepare for Army basic training? What training and exercises would be useful before the onset?
Prepare yourself with the idea that your going to be treated like a dog, and after that period of training you'll see that it's built you. It starts with being extremely on top of you to follow their exact words, from the moment you wake till after lights are out at night. Once you surrender to that then they've kinda taken away your free will but they'll make you do stuff you never realised you could do, push your body much further then you ever could and you see how much all the barriers are just in the head. The time will fly by quickly. A great tip is practicing getting basic tasks done in as few minutes as possible. Practice getting changed out of full uniform or something close to that, showering, and redressing including boots with high laces as quickly as you can. Time yourself and…

First of all this question is ridiculous! Would you ask someone, “Why is having Diabetes a desirable diagnosis?” Of course you wouldn't!!! So why does society look at mental illness any different? It is an ILLNESS, just like any other TRAGIC medical condition that someone has to adjust their life to live with?
I too have to live with bipolar 2 and have the ups and downs, mixed episodes, rapid cycling, etc. I've had to learn to live with this by taking medications, training my brain to think differently/cognitively (on a daily basis). I also live with a rare liver disease that was caused from stress related, ulcerated colitis and will need a liver transplant some day. Another medical condition I have to adjust too, which I don't consider a desirable diagnosis!!😏 And my husband does have a very serious case of insulin resistant diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, as well as lung disease, which we don't consider a desirable diagnosis either!!
So, even the thought of bipolar 1 or 2 as a desirable diagnosis, is off the chart ridiculous!!🙄

Sayan Mukherjee according to your explanation, it should have been- Whom are you talking about? Since you can replace it with ‘him’ not ‘he’. I am talking about him, not he. So, I guess you can’t say- who are you talking about? Plz, correct me if I got your explanation wrong. Thank you!

Is the word 'day' a concrete noun?
Yes, ‘day’ is a concrete noun.
Here, the major difference between a concrete noun and an abstract noun is a concrete noun has a plural form like: day- days but an abstract noun has no plural form.
So, ‘day’ is a concrete and common noun; not an abstract noun.
Hopefully, this explanation helps!

What is the meaning of your life?

I can't trust my boyfriend, what should I do?
Go to marriage counseling together. Set some goals for you and him so he doesn’t feel like it’s all about him. If he doesn’t follow through on the changes that he needs to make after a designated amount of time(6months or something) and doesn’t stop lying then consider leaving him. If he wants to be with you he will get the help that he needs and will make the changes. Also, I’ve had two kids. Your hormones may still be going crazy and getting back to normal. So, don’t make any big decisions until your baby is at least a year old and your feeling totally back to normal after having a baby. Maybe try getting a babysitter and going out on a date and have a positive experience together. Maybe he’s overwhelmed by the responsibility of having a baby and needs your attention. He could be lying to…

Should religion be a criterion for a relationship?
I think core beliefs are important when deciding to have a relationship with someone, especially if it is going to be a serious one. For example, if one of you is atheist and the other christian you will definitely have different ideas of how to raise your children. If you don’t believe in God, you’d probably not want your children going to church and brought up to believe in “nonsense”. It wouldn’t be fair to your spouse that wants to bring them up to believe in God and Jesus. It’s better to find someone that believes the same as you. People have really strong feelings about their religion or decision to not be religious. I think it would cause a lot of stress in the relationship to disagree on such a core part of who you are. I guess if you’re not going to have any kids with the person you’…

Can some one give me tips on learning piano?
Learn some music theory so you can learn the notes. Listen to the song you want to learn. Hearing it will help develop your listening skills and will help you understand how the piece should sound. If you want to just learn a song then just work on it every day until it's learned. If you really love the song and are motivated to learn it you can. It might take some time of you can't read music or have never played the piano. You can just learn the notes for the piece you want and learn to play the song. There is nothing wrong with that. If you want to be proficient find a teacher. Practice fundamentals like scales, arpeggios and etudes every day and find a piece you love to motivate yourself. If you have limited time learn to read music and scales first. Pick one scale and get until you can pl…

What kdrama can you recommend if I like realistic ones? I’m in my 40s and I am not into cute light hearted dramas.
I’d like to add the drama V.I.P to the list as well. It's a relationship drama dealing with infedelity. It's slow paced and I think you need to be in your 30+ at least, to find it appealing.

Check out “It’s ok, that’s love”. It has a couple of years on its’ back, but it’s actually a really nice drama that touches both adult relationships and mental health. Signal is also really good. It has a bit of a supernatural touch to it, but it’s a crime drama that’s neither cute nor lighthearted. What I really like about it is that every case on the drama is authentic.

I bought 3 32DD Victorias Secrets bras and only one fits me, if their all the same size then why don't I fit in the rest of them?
It’s just like buying shoes without trying them on first. Style, material, purpose etc all play a big part to how the shoe (or bra in this case) will fit you.

Do I have to wear a sports bra for sports?
I’d say it depends on your size. If you have large/heavy breasts you might find a tight fitting sports bra is more comfortable. There are great sports bras with cups and underwire for a larger chest. Plus the fabric is usually better if you get a bit sweaty. Most of them are also machine washable. A regular bra isn't made to be machine washed, and the fabric isn't made to soak in sweat. Support wise - go for whatever feels the best.

Where can I buy good strapless bras?
I don't know where you live so it's hard to recommend a certain store. But there are a couple of really nice quality brands I would like to recommend. Google them and see what stores near you carry them. I have owned strapless bras from Prima Donna, Fantasie and Maidenform. All of them have been brilliant! I had a breast reduction a few years ago. Before I had it I was a 28G. I could dance, jump and run in my Maidenform strapless bra without any nasty surprises. Says quite a lot about fit :) These brands (depending on what you usually spend) are on the more pricy side. But a great investment since you can wear them for years, if you care for them properly. My tumb rule is to always go for a brand that specifically manufacturers bras/lingerie. That way you get what you pay for. Buying a “brand…

What are Swedish guys like?
Depending on his age.. But I recon most Swedish men are very willing to help out with household chores. They’ll cook, clean wash and iron. And you never have to tell them twice to take out the trash. If you're cooking or cleaning they will usually ask if you need a hand. They're down to earth, clean and dress pretty well. But then again, there are always exceptions!

How are bra sizes measured?
Never measure. Ever.
…
Try on one that you believe is your size. Ask staff for some assistance . A skilled bra sasales sales person usually only needs to take a look to determinde your bra size. Or at least close enough to find your perfect size.¶

Back part should be low, far below the shoulder blades (approx. down at the middmid middle of your back) . When first putting it on, lean a bit forward, get your arms and boobs in there. When closing the back (never do this in front of you, twisting the bra around your body. Close it where the hooks should go, behind your back), go for the first (outmost) set of hooks. You should be able to fit a finger in under the back now, no more no less. Straps should be the same. A finger -thight not more, no less. Support should come from below, nothing should be “hanging” in the straps.

Or at least close enough to find your perfect size. Back part should be low, far below the shoulder blades (approx. down at the middle of your back) . When first putting it on, lean a bit forward, get your arms and boobs in there. When closing the back (never do this in front of you, twisting the bra around your body.

Have to agree with #10. Korean skin care & make up is simply outstanding. Have been using it for a couple of years now. If a product claims to be water proof, it’s water proof/smudge proof etc, and beyond. And most of the stuff will cost you a fraction of the high end crap sold in Europe and the US . If you wanna splurge on something, check out skincare from OHUI & Laneige. Gotta love it!

Yes I believe it is very possible. I know because I was 14 years old when I found my soulmate, bestfriend. Love doesn't know age. Just because they are young doesn't mean they dont know in fact are probably more likely to they're more open minded.

The DSM -5 doesn’t have diagnostic codes for psychopaths or sociopaths. I can cry and do cry and I have a dx of ASPD, but have other co-morbid dx’s that allow me more sensitivity. I think we have to look at the whole person and not just one standard of behaviors that are written. I have dealt with many people with my dx; they are all different.

Well I know with borderlines there is no silver lining. It’s very black and white thinking. It’s not that you aren’t or are on or the other because you can be both. There are times where you can be super empathetic and there are times where you are what seems to others heartless. But in my mind it’s not that we’re trying to be heartless it’s just a defensive mechanism to shield ourselves from repressed trauma and trying a different approach which then leads to ruining the relationship anyways. Which then can lead to self harm, self critical and impulsive decision. It’s almost a routine for me. A “pattern” in others eyes.

It never made me feel aroused until I started slamming it which I recommend to never try because it will suck you right in to only wanting to do it that way and not smoke it. Honestly you guys should put the stuff down and start getting into psycadelics they are healing and can also bring you guys closer

What is your episode of borderline personality disorder?
I can never stay in one place. Some people change their looks I just run away to a new city or state and I make all the friends and then hurt someone and disappear again. Then I return and everyone watches me be this girl saying I’m happy now I’m not I’m here now I’m there I’m good and evil. Deep down just a innocent little girl that has never received the love I needed. I was alone 24/7 an only child with no parents. Luckily I could have turned out way worse but I did find Jesus and he has carried me most of the way including suicide attempts yes more than 3.. I find borderline a very interesting disorder. It’s fun sometimes how wild I can be it’s adventurous and never dull. But it can tend to cause myself and others pain and distrust and misunderstanding. Cheers to never being understood…

It never made since to me until I questioned it and found out he was choking himself the way David carradine did Otto affixiation I just knew he wouldn't be naked hanging on the door on a hook in the bathroom and more drugs on the table.

Hello,
Thanks for your reply. My DOB and TOB is 27.01.1981 11.36 am and my spouse’s is 19.07.1980 1.40 am (i.e.,18th July past midnight).
If you could show some light on this it would be really helpful and give me some peace of mind if everything is positive as per our birth charts. As I do not intend a divorce due to children being involved.

According to me, Golden rule to have a successful relationship is “Respect each other” and the rest will follow.
You feel far more superior than your spouse in terms of looks or intellect, which could be the truth. But remember “Opposites attract”. Since you are the smart and spontaneous one in your relationship take the lead and do come up with interesting and exciting things for you both rather than expecting it to come from him. Communicate what you feel. It’s an individual’s nature which he/she have developed through the years and it’s not fair to expect something out of them which they can’t do it naturally. Only when someone does something on ones own then it has its charm. If it’s done to please someone then it won’t last for long. The other side of the mountain is always green. But all you need to see and enjoy is the pasture on your side.
At the end of it, it’s one life everyone has. If you still feel superior than your partner and feel a void then it’s best to give a thought if you can look for someone who would fit in your idea of an ideal partner. But that’s a big gamble what you would end up doing as you never know what’s in store for you in future. Don’t let the life you have slip away.
The lockdown is not going to stay forever and so are these thoughts. It’s a low phase and since you aren’t too occupied with the mundane activities of day to day life you could be overthinking and letting these affect you.
You are lucky to have loving in laws and a loving husband who is probably not so expressive. These are the things which would actually matter for a peaceful life on a long run. Excitement and adventure fades as and when years pass by, what stays is the calmness in the relationship. Wake up to reality is all I can say.
All the best👍

Women who are skinny and don’t have any curves, how do you feel good about your body?
Since it’s okay to be skinny and not have curves, nobody should feel bad. If I were to ask how fat people feel good about their body, it would be pretty rude right?
the best thing about being skinny is that you can move and exercise and not run out breathe. Since I do not have big hips anymore and I have lost most of my curve since I aged I don’t bother trying to impress the world. If someone wants to put be down because I do not have enough curves then I just don’t bother talking to that person. It’s simple.

CPS is supposed to save children and sadly it’s the only resource we have to try and help. I actually think the whole CPS program need a complete overhaul. We need to allow pubic oversight on theee matters somehow and we need to be able to hold workers who do not do their job accountable. The juvenile system is a joke. I was taken out of my home at age 14, which was too late to save me from a lot of abuse. The state deemed my very messed up “mother” fit and made me go back into her “care”. When I was in holding facilities and youth homes it wasn’t better than home. I’m not sure about what scientific evidence there is on a child being brain damaged from being away from their mother, but being abused by their own mothers definitely is not good. I can speak on both of those from experience.
This post was from a year ago so I’m not sure what the original question was, but ultimately I don’t think it’s should be used to get back at someone out of revenge.

How do I get back at someone for calling child protective services on me and making false claims? I've already called CPS on them because they are abusive but I'm sure nothing will come of it because this person is a pathological liar. What can I do?
Child protective services is met for children who are in psychological danger, physical danger, or who are being sexually assaulted. When people play games with each other using CPS you take up time for stupid shit when the workers could be actually saving and resources to save children who are actually being abused. really need help. Sometimes parents who are fucked screwed up need a wake up call. I agree with calling CPS on some people are right under If the radar and just one the cusp of traumatizing children. It’s ridiculous child is really in danger then get evidence to me how people do not take care of children and use drugs in front of them.support it.

How and why might our dreams alert us to ill health or impending disease? How might researchers use sleep study of what takes place physiologically in the brain during dreams to help develop new medical devices and interventions?
I think that often times we lose touch with our bodies. Our subconscious mind never does, so dreaming of sickness could be that part of ourselves which is subconsciously trying to get us to listen. Trying to unravel the mind in general is something many scientist have been working on. I have read a article stating they may have found a way to record our dreams so we can rewatch them like a movie the next day, but I’m not sure how much truth there is to that. It sounds more like a episode of black mirror.

How and when have dreams ever helped to alert you to current or impending problems in your life, including health related as well as emotional or psychological issues?
Yes. I have been a warned of boyfriends who would be abusive in my dreams. I would doubt myself but those dreams unfortunately came true. So when I have dreams like that I use caution and become more aware of red flags. I have been warned that a hardship was coming or a death of a loved one was going to happen. It helps me brace for the storms. Rarely do I have health related news but I have gotten told to eat more garlic or to check my blood sugar.

Can your consciousness force your brain to overcome sleep paralysis?
Yes! It has worked for me. I had sleep paralysis several times it got to the point that I could pull myself out of it. It involved my conscious mind working with my hand and slapping my face out of it! I will have it happen and I know it’s not real so I just try to calm myself down when it’s happening or I mutter a prayer out if it’s scary enough.

It could be stress. It could be unresolved trauma. It could be paranormal things if you are a believer of such things. Try meditating or talking this out with someone you trust.

I lived in a orphanage. I was made a state ward when I was 14. It was a very sad scary place. I still have nightmares of it. I wake up and I am literally in one of the rooms I had to stay in, it’s horrible.

I am a believer of past lives. I have watched a lot of videos of children who recall details of their past life and sone of their details are in dreams. Maybe in a past life you were in a concentration camp or you were one of the soldiers guarding one and you don’t want to face the guilt of being that. I think it would be worth exploring the history of that period and visiting a holocaust museum. If the dream bothers you a lot I would start there to try to decode what’s up with that. That’s just what I would do.

Do people who instinctively pay very close attention to details in their waking lives tend to have more vivid dreams?
I’m pretty out of it a lot from being fatigued and yet I dream very vividly.

How does a person recovering from Borderline Personality Disorder start to develop an identity?
When you are recovering from, or evolving out of, a Borderline Personality Disorder, you may find yourself confused about who you really are. A number of factors are likely to have contributed to this: * Your childhood situation probably did not offer much support for self exploration. * You may have adopted a facade designed to please your parents and maximize getting love and support. * Lack of “whole object relations” (an integrated and realistic sense of self that includes both your good qualities and your bad) left you with the mistaken idea that if you were not all-good, you must be all-bad. Notice your internal reactions: Inside each of us is something that responds to everything that we encounter with a “yes,” “no,” or “maybe? maybe not?” These responses help us identify who we are and what we like and do not like. We can consider these responses as important components of our identity because they are authentic and based on our own internal reactions and not externally imposed standards. Sometimes the response is so strong that we experience it instantly and clearly. For example, someone offered me a taste of raw sea urchin, and the second my tongue touched it, I was repulsed. It was a definite instantaneous “no!!!” I also remember back to the time I entered someone’s house and saw these two chairs covered in a bright blue-green velvet. I had such a strong “yes” response that I suddenly knew for the first time what my favorite color was. * Notice Your Instinctive Reactions Young children are not confused about their reactions. That is why many great artists, such as Jean Dubuffet, tried to emulate the freshness of children when they painted. Pick an area like smell or taste and consciously explore your gut reactions without regard to what you think you should like or dislike. Example: When one of my daughters was young, we were at a mall shopping and I became exhausted and started to get cranky. She told me to close my eyes, she had something she wanted me to smell. I reluctantly did it. She put a bar of grapefruit scented soap under my nose and I was shocked to find I immediately perked up and my crankiness disappeared. I felt invigorated. My reaction was both positive and unexpected. Since then I have explored my different reactions to categories of scents—florals, citrus, woodsy, and so on. This is easiest to do with unblended essential oils because trying one scent at a time makes finding what I like and dislike easier. I recommend exercises like these to help my clients discover who they are and what they like. * Try Different Activities Let’s imagine that you want to exercise because you know it is healthy, but you have no idea what type of exercise might suit you. I suggest you experiment and try three very different ones that seem interesting to you. Then notice your reaction to each one. If you do not like any of the first three, choose a new three to try. Keep doing this until you have found one or two you like doing. Again, noticing the pattern of what we like and dislike, or are indifferent to, gradually helps us build a sense of identity. Example: Much to my surprise, I found that I mainly gravitated to forms of exercise that required no equipment, involved circular movements, co-ordination, and could be done by myself. When I was younger I was passionate about “belly dancing” and now I am very engaged with Tai Chi. See if you can see a pattern to what you like. * Meet Different Kinds of People Part of our identity involves who we actually enjoy spending time with. Again, this can be undertaken as an experiment. When I tried it, I found that most of the people I was naturally drawn to had some of the following characteristics: * They were very smart. * They had strange childhoods. * They “got” my strange sense of humor and found me funny. * They laughed easily. * They were deeply involved in their own interests. * They were quirky. Punchline: Whether you are a recovering Borderline or not, you can discover important aspects of your identity through experimentation and trial and error, focusing on your internal reactions, and trusting your gut.

Right here with you, Meredith & Dina. I'm 46yo & treatment resistant, just took me 20 odd GP appointments to get a GP on board. I salute humanity, all the power to one & all. My experience is torture & I can not remember it feeling any different because it has never been. I have never felt what the world is like without an untreatable mental disorder & the BPD symptoms are by far the most difficult to manage every moment of every day, day in & day out. 🖖

Nailed it. 👊
It's not personal either.
I find the efforts involved are huge to personally interact some days. Coupled with the effort to get to the 'cafe' for example, I am exhausted before any interaction. Then there's the relief to be at the destination which is short lived. The social anxiety & awkward jittering & jolting movements ramp up. The coffee will likely spill. Then the side internal chit chat in fuzzy brain starts. It's all exhausting, sometimes to some degree.

Ditto Marni, couldn't agree more. 👊
The group skills facilitator hesitancy would be influencing your experience of the skills group, for sure. You may not appreciate her, but listen to what she has to say and be curious.
I imagine a zoom meeting rather than F2F group is also difficult and probably not ideal. I think personally I would find that very hard and as a result wouldn't rate the group experience or the content. Just sayin'… 🤗
Are the group skills facilitator and your 1:1 psychologist the same person? The 1:1 Psychologist, it's pivotal that you feel comfortable with and have a good working relationship. You should explore your concerns with your 1:1 DBT Psychologist.
Hang-in there. It's all awkward, uncomfortable, a little foreign and new, mashed in with a lot of emotions.

What is your favorite social media platform? Why?
I’m going with Twitter, it’s fast, global and covers every possible issue so there is space for everyone. I love the search features. I see Twitter as a resource hub with a wealth of fresh content every second, which is great for Social Media Marketing. Equal second - has to be the visual platforms, Instagram and Pinterest. Interested to see what other people respond as I believe there is a place for all of the major platforms and 2017 will see them further carve out their niche audiences and competitively innovate.

Can being too nice make someone look weak, needy, or desperate if they don't know how to set boundaries?
GOD YES! I used to seriously get off on being the nIce guy. I thought it was my “thing”. I used to pride myself on being polite, having manners and it was what I was known for because I desperately wanted to be liked and I was constantly seeking approval from the world. Then one day I realized being nice is what weak men (people) are and no man out there has a shred of self respect if he’s always saying please and thank you and always going out of his way to help others. I mean…don’t be a dick but there comes a point where I realized being nice gets you nowhere and if anything I should try to focus on just Beijing quiet. Say less. Because when you do people will most likely listen. I would be so nice to others and since I was a pushover people would constantly walk all over me and take adv…

Once, I was getting off the bus in downtown Los Angeles, heading to the train stop. I was on my way to my friend's mother's funeral in Pasadena and was in a hurry. As I walked down 6th Street, I saw a man open some kind of folder, and money fell out. It looked like a lot, but he didn’t even notice and kept walking down the street.
I walked up to the pile of money and saw him speed-walking ahead. I looked at the massive pile of $100 bills (massive is relative, but it looked like a lot). I looked back at the man, but he was already out of sight. I frantically picked up the money and thought to myself, “This is a moment of honesty. Are you going to chase after the man and give him what is rightfully his? What are you going to do?”
I stood there with the money in my hands, contemplating this decision. Three people walking by together stopped to look at me. They weren’t speaking English, possibly Dutch, and seemed to be wondering, “What’s this guy doing with all that money?” A voice in my head said, “Be honest, Chris. Make an attempt to get this money to its rightful owner.”
So, I asked them, “Is this yours?” They looked at me speechless, their mouths open, and just said, “Uhhhhhhhh.” As they were saying ""uh,"" I thought, “Screw them. Screw the guy who dropped the money. You are broke. Take the money and run! Hurry up before the guy comes back. Go now! You have a funeral to attend!”
So, I ran away. It felt like a Looney Tunes cartoon. I bolted out of there and ran to the metro station. Once I was on the train, I took out the money and counted $2,500. I couldn’t believe it. Was it from God? Who knows? I didn’t care. I had an extra $2,500. I actually gave $400 of it to my friend for his mom’s funeral because they had no money and were asking for donations. I spent the rest on my car fund. I still can’t believe that story when I think about it.

I grew up in Canada. Left for the USA in 2000 and haven’t looked back. My worst day in the US is better than any day I spent growing up. There is so much isolation in Canada. Experiencing winter 6–7 months of the year does a number on your mental health and the weather overall is just crap. The cities are few and far between and there is no life or energy in the smaller rural communities . The healthcare is AMAZING as long as you don’t get sick and Canadians suffer from a lack of identity . They don’t know who they are and they live in the shadows of the US, which they hate. Because of this they’ve seemed to latch on absurd woke ideologies and have a disdain for Christianity. The criminals in charge only support progressive and liberal ideas and they are trying to take away freedom of speech. Have you heard these new hate speech laws they’re trying to pass? Absolutely ridiculous . Canada is over.

How do I make my living room classy?
It’s not necessarily about money and I’m not a designer but I’ve always felt that things like nice drapes that hang higher than where your window sits and always touch the floor are a great way to make your space look more luxurious. I make sure to paint the rooms or use a nice peel and stick wallpaper (I usually buy wallpaper on offer up/ Mercari / Craigslist bc it’s cheaper ). White furniture is a good option unless you have pets or children and keeping the space tidy / clutter free will make a huge difference .

Do cockapoos stay cute into adulthood?
My cockapoos are going on eighteen years old. Ive had them since they were puppies . They’ve been in excellent health their entire lives except one has been blind since he was about 3 and they both went deaf a few years ago. These are handicaps but we’ve learned to adjust and live with the reality of having to watch out for things like parked cars when I take the blind one out on a walk. Being deaf was sort of a blessing (for me) because they literally don’t bark. It’s really funny because there are cats everywhere in my neighborhood and some of them sleep on my front door step. My one dog who can see will get a little wound up when they’re in the yard and sometimes he’ll let out the most pathetic weirdest sounding bark to try and scare them and the cats just look at him like “what the hell was that ?” It’s so cute Because They don’t even know how to bark anymore. In the past few years as they’ve gotten older they continue to melt my heart with their cuteness. Everyday they’ll want to play but it’s gone from 10-15 mins of playtime a day to 2 mins of playtime ( which I’m fine with ) . People always ask if they’re puppies and When I tell them how old they are and they are 18 they are amazed.

How can one become a gay porn star?
Getting into Gay porn can be the easiest thing you’ll ever do But it depends on a few things… I was in the adult entertainment industry for almost 7 years and I worked for a bunch of the studios. I did over 150 scenes/movies and I had a pretty good run. it’s been about five years since I’ve done any filming and I have no plans to go back back. The industry has completely change and I was fortunate to be able to experience the end of the “Pornstar era”. Only fans has taken over and it’s not what it used to be. the way that I got in was by going on the different adult porn sites and just click on the link that says become a model. You take some selfie‘s with your phone and be honest about your measurements. if they like you They'll call you. seriously it’s that easy.easy. The casting directors used to tell me they’d get dozens or maybe even hundreds of submissions a week from men who were not attractive AT ALL but they had they had secret fantasy of being discovered and staring in gay porn.

No. Really please don't just because its family. They are the ones that can hurt you the most and normally end up doing so. If somthing about a person don't feel right it probably isn't only ever trust yourself.

Why am I acting like a robot? I can't explain it. I'm so emotional, yet I can't express these emotions.
Hey
I feel like this most times but to be honest when I feel like this I have way to much going on and don't no how I feel the best thing is get uself some paper and a pen start by asking how u feel and why u feel like this. u will either have two out comes u cant write as ur mind goes blank and it seems wrong and you dont do it. Or you will find ur self writing so much stuff that the pen doesn't stop. Even if it dont make sense you will be able to understand it.

I'm 50 and I want to stop all communication with my mother. I can't take any more of her negative, unkind comments about me. Am I right to do this?
Hi well you are 50 how long has this been going on? What has stopped you from leaving in the past?
Anyway to answer your question ❔
Yes you have every right to leave your mother its your life you need to do whats best for you and be careful how u do things and always make sure you have no contact and u go for good, nobody is ever going to save you can only yourself.

Hi its sad seeing you ask this question.
I really hope you choose you're grandchildren over this man he should never make u choose between him and family . Especially when then could end up in the the system and they will so vurable. And they could even be split up, so stick with your grandchildren the rewards will be wonderful and so much better then sticking up for a selfish man and regretting you're choice and wondering we're your grandchildren are, good luck.

Only someone who has not lived the black experience would mock it up to just skin complexion it is much deeper than that. There is also classism and microagression. Being black isn't just about the obvious, it's about institutionalized racism and flaw finding. What is so wrong with Harry's decision if it was his to make?

Freedom from pain. My intuition helped me realize that so much of what was “hurting"" me was actually my own perception. Physical pain usually doesn't last very long. But mental anguish and torment can last into perpetuity. I realized most of what bothered me was not occurring real time. It was past events or my mind projecting expected outcomes onto the “future"". Present tense I was actually doing just fine. I just needed to accept that reality. Overnight, once I moved my mind towards radical acceptance, my mood changed. I felt lighter. I could smile, sing, dance, and simply enjoy life's little things. Because I was no longer living in expectation of or in fear of. Operating from a place of fear is never good for us. It's only intended for survival and self preservation in dire circumstanc…

Benjamin Hill Mark's, respectfully I disagree.

“When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.
We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.
A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”

Sir, first what you make light of and allude to and that “oh poor me a race that decries racism"" talk is disrespectful. Especially because we are all human, and subject to failings, but doesnt diminish the fact that for many discriminatory experiences are real., and traumatic. Sir, what you experienced is poor service point blank. In every instance the blame was shifted to anyone but whomever was in your employ.
Secondly and more importantly, race or sexual orientation or any protected category is not a euphemistic card to be played. These things are not games they get at the very heart of identity and for some are not easily dismissed. I certainly cannot hide my complexion and why would I? Race is not a card♦ to be pulled or played from a deck so to speak arbitrarily.
This is is not a zero sum game. If so, please bear with me as I illustrate this in much the way we appear in the world (colorful, tribal i.e “suited"").
How did this Race card get in the deck♥️?
Are all the other cards of the same suit♠️ ?
Is only one card is representative of race♥️?
Is that representative of the planet♠♥♦♣?
Who is the dealer?
How can he be in a position to assign race a card?
Colonialism, classism, and privilege are embedded in that ""Race Card"" statement. Those dismissive arguments add injury to insult, because at it's core is indifference an apathy. That requires a position of privilege, much like a metaphor king and his subjects. Now I have respectfully explained this statement and you being a respectful business owner I hope you will understand the sentiment. The history of human civilization is filled with the reasons why people experience interactions a certain way. Certainly it should never disrupt business or in this case either diners enjoying a paid for dining experience. But as you so kindly expressed, respect is a two way street, and qualifying these descriptors as playing cards is at its core disrespectful.

Something else that will blow your mind… I am a black female and descendant of Jews, probably a higher percentage than you. Jews. So, I am guessing that makes me a “double negative” as far as your concerned. Stop trying to justify ignorance, and paint all of one group as some ungrateful monolith, or decry one groups inhumane experience as more inhumane than another group's. Own up to it! Pain is pain and cruelty is cruelty, it isnt a numbers game. We all do inherit this jacked up world, but we all do have the power to make a difference in one human's experience of this thing called LIFE.
Try it sometimes, oh and BTW speaking truth isnt anger. Doth do protest too much.

It is a completely different disease. It’s where people are completely paralyzed and can’t communicate with the outside world, but are fully cognitive and have normal brain functioning, but can’t speak, move their body or communicate with anybody else, and just seems to be a vegetable or in a coma. Some have actually come out of this syndrome and tell family members they could hear them and feel things the whole time they were “locked in” their body.

You made the right decision. This does hurt and will be hard, but time heals all wounds, and it will be worth it in the end instead of being stuck in a miserable relationship with no trust and someone that walks out on you multiple times. The right someone will come along, but you won’t find him as long as you have the other Loser around. Some people keep a partner around for comfort while they still play the field and that’s not fair for you and I’m sure your daughters want to see you happy, I guarantee you he’ll find a woman that does the same thing to him, and he will try to get you back numerous times, but don’t fall for it. Was he thinking about you when he had children with other women? Just know that there’s somebody better out there for you, And you have to be patient unfortunately. I’m in the same shoes. The more time you Stay with this winner you may miss the Opportunity to connect with the one that truly deserves your heart and will be your partner for life. Don’t let this asshole waste your time anymore. Life is short you don’t wanna end it with regrets.

What does your gut tell you? Has his spending habits changed recently? When you ask him, does he get defensive or gaslight you? It took me too long to realize that my guy knew the answer to things before my head. Listen to it. I’m sure it took a lot of sacrifice, scrimping and patience to save that much. Whoever took it didn’t care to think about what you go through to save. If you feel like he did, leave him, this is just a preview of what will come later. You deserve better.

Past resentments? No one “has to” trade sex for anything. There are so many other options, like a job, roommates, shelter, family. As well as there are many resources for food, food pantry, soup kitchens, churches, and food stamps to get someone on their feet. I hope no one feels they need to trade their body and dignity for basic needs and shame on those who assume that is currency. (Not assuming you do this) The original post did say other than financial reasons.

Sometimes cultural, or traditional beliefs can make someone not leave. But if it’s internal reasons, there could be so many. Most people bring childhood trauma into their adult relationships, it could be someone is afraid to leave because the other person could not survive without them, or holding on to hope that things can be what the they once were. Once I felt that I Invested so much of myself that I couldn’t let go, only later realizing I was wasting more time holding on to dead weight. There are codependent people as well as emotionally attached that they cannot see themselves without their spouse. Even with no money involved, some seek Status or self worth can keep someone around. Everyone’s needs and past trauma are so different and complex that it’s hard to pinpoint why people do what they do.

I just wanted to throw this out there. You cannot get hep C from your old blood in a needle. Hep c is a virus and must come from a host. Bacteria and fungi can form in a dirty needle, but unless someone who has hep c used the needle you before you that’s a different story. Not trying to be a troll, just wanted the correct info out there.
In regards to your question, I know someone that happens to as well. I wonder if there is something in the blood like more of a certain mineral from vitamins, or food? It’s amazing how many metals are in our blood as well as other things our bodies produce. If you find out what it is, please let us know. 🙂

By any chance can you see an doctor specialized in addiction without a referral from your PCP? I have been there myself with the the methadone and Xanax and klonpin prescribed. I switched doctors ( I went to a community health center since it was the private doctor that kept me addicted). They were able to take me down on the benzos by switching the type and dose. The methadone, I went to a rehab. Unfortunately, they didn’t really taper me off so I was hurting for almost 2 months, but it did start to get better in a few weeks. The detox sucked but wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be and by being in a “safe environment” I wasn’t craving as bad. I used to sweat so bad I couldn’t wear make up. Ever. It will suck but you’ll make it. And it’ll be so much better on the other side. Going through that every single day is a slow drawn out hell. I will try to call a community center and see if they have a doctor willing to take on your detox. Benzos are dangerous so you may need to go to a detox. See if you can do a CSS or TSS after to give you some more time from being alone with your prescriptions.
Do you have a plan to manage your chronic pain?That’s important too since that’s whyyou are prescribed the medication, right? It’s hard with depression and anxiety, There are a lot of mental health providers today that specialize in both addiction and mental health. I wish you the best and hope you find a real doctor.

How do you send money to an inmate?
It depends on the jail or prison you want to send money to. Some only take USPS money orders, and some they have vendor websites that deal with inmate money and phone call accounts.and The ones in Massachusetts have a website you create an account on, and you can enter your credit card or debit info, from then on you can start putting in money either by phone or the account online. When I was in California money was sent by money orders. Always look up the jail/prison website, they always have that information on there.

It's not about denial,or ridiculous “facts” , it's about the fact that how absurdly these statements are generalised.Obviously it doesn't matter what someone chooses to believe or decides to know, it's their basic right, what does matter is that such statements are not so much of inferences as guidelines. Societal pressure plays a major role in forming the psychology of a 'person'.
All the above statements are based on the assumption that these are the innate qualities of a female. For example, you are a person dating a woman,if you do not consider it slutty for her to make the first move she will NOT feel this way. The so called psychological characteristics are in fact responses to the expectations, which further reflect the psychological parameters of the other side. I am not aiming for a battle of the sexes or something, it's just that if you think about it objectively,there are no such rules binding the behavior of half of the world's population. So,generalizing such assumption or inferences sets up a positive feedback system which than forces everyone to fit themselves into a prescribed criteria, not because they want it so but that it is expected of them.

What did you realize today?
Last few days has been a mess, despite my best efforts to stay out of controversies,I am the centre of shitnado going around right now.
You see,I have always been alone,I never had a friend because I didn't need one.I didn't talk to my friends at school about stuff because they were useless,they couldn't help me.I didn't talk to Mama because we have never been close on any level except suffering together.I didn't try and make friends outside of my immediate circle because that's considered elementary promiscuity in my culture.
But more than anything,I 'believed' I didn't need one. No one can understand you completely and 90% of your “friends” don't want to understand you.

Well,if you still have full range of rotation at the joint,chances are you didn't rupture a ligament, and if you can't see any gross deformity once the swelling subsides, the fracture can also probably self heal.If not,then do consult…I dunno how medical system works at your place,but if you can get it X-rayed without prior consultation, just send me the picture and I can have my seniors look at it.
Get well soon!!!

Dude, being a doctor,I do understand your concerns regarding the system and stuff, but if it was as severe as you wrote,or if there was any sound during the initial impact,it was at least a hair-line fracture, which DOES NOT heal in a week.Even if you are not planning on seeking any sort of help, the worst you can do is to try to make it work normally.A few days' rest won't hurt as much as the long term consequences.

Why are you involved with a fandom if you don't like the source material?
I would like to put some bullets through it: * I spend a LOT of time on the internet and in order to keep it interesting,I go through heaps of crap just for the heck of it. * If you look at the psychology behind these fandoms being formed,there are a lot of triggers for your oxytocin pulses and I'm a depressed girl looking for anything that can get me it. * I love reading fanfiction, and most of the fandoms I come across are through that channel. * I am a very curious person, the cat has been long dead,my city has a feline infestation rate below zero,stuff doesn't need to be good for me to spend hours indulged in it. * If something exists,I must know everything about it. * I have a thing for studying masses and going through a fandom is an easy way to make out patterns and inclinations of a particular demog…

How open are transgender people about their transition? Do the people they’ve met after their transition know about it?
Well I can’t speak for all the sisters but as for myself, I’m completely open about it. I’ve been living as a woman for almost 5 years now essentially and it’s old hat amongst my social/work worlds. I announced my transition publicly at the start of all the covid lockdowns via my Facebook account just to get it out there in case I died because it was important to me to be honest to all who knew the old me and who I was becoming. Most importantly it was something that I needed to do for myself. I’m an open book on every level these days and couldn’t be happier!

What will happen to someone who ODs at a music festival? Does it happen often?
They usually receive medical attention as soon as it’s been brought to the attention of the medical team/security/paramedics. Many years ago about 30 or so I attended a 3 day rave campout in Kentucky if memory serves me correctly. The promoter had a campground and paramedics on site. The county sheriffs department was not thrilled about it and shut the event down regardless of the legality of it. The party moved from campground to campground in a cat and mouse game of sorts. On the second day a girl was found dead in her tent from a heroin overdose, the paramedics had stopped coming after the party had moved for the third or fourth time and I still wonder if she might have lived if we stayed in that one location. It was the first rave scene death any of us had experienced and although the…

What is the best rave you ever been to?
I would have to say Voyager , I think that was the name, which took place in one of the columns of the Brooklyn bridge. It was the early 90’s and probably still to this day the most unique location for a party I have ever experienced. It was a great party, amazing location, and a top notch line up. One of my favorite memories was seeing all my fellow party people walking back across the bridge as daytime reality was settling in for most of NYC. I will treasure that party until I no longer walk the earth. Close runner up Furthur 1994 by Drop Bass Network. It was 3 day campout in the middle of nowhere Wisconsin. It was a muddy, pagan acid fueled weekend that as the saying goes “you just had to be there”. Aphex Twin live, SF’s Hardkiss posse, Adam X, Frankie Bones, Hoschi and so many more. I g…

Once there was a woman who was throwing garbage on Holy Prophet Muhammad S.A.W daily when He S.A.W was going to masjid… one day garbage was not thrown over him.. so He inquired about that woman from his respected companions… found that she was ill that's why she didn't throw garbage today… So the Holy Prophet Muhammad S.A.W decided to visit at her house and ask about her health.. and pray for her that may Almighty Allah bless her with healthier life… so when thay do so.. the woman realized that how mercy he is she was much inspired by this.. and felt ashamed of all that she did.. so she decided to accept Islam…
This story has no reference.. It doesn't appear in any books of hadith

I love Islam but I really hate the fact that the Prophet married a 4-6 year old. This makes me want to leave the religion. I find this absolutely disgusting. What should I do?
There are ~17 sahih hadiths stating the age of Ai'sha, from different sources, using different chains of narration.
Good luck to you, friend.

Do Muslims really believe that it is okay to murder someone if that person insults the prophet?

Also, just so you know, I don't consider myself a part of this religion anymore. I had extreme doubts about this religion even when I wrote this answer two years ago.

There is no law about changing your mailbox. In places that snow plows often hit them and destroy both the post and box. They sell mailboxes in home depot. Some people just change their mailbox because they don't like the one they have. I have personally gotten new mailboxes for both reasons.

How much does it cost to clean your teeth without insurance in the USA?
Some places offer new patient specials for as little as 60 dollars. But they usually don't do a very good job. I believe it differs by region but where I live in the northeast it would likely be about 200 dollars. And then they will say you need exrays for a couple hundred more. My last dental procedure was a crown that cost 1800. I don't have dental insurance but even people who do usually have high copays.I wish we had universal health care. Dont even get me started on how much I have to pay for prescription glasses!

Do you remember the exact moment you realized your ex/SO lacked emotional empathy and was just faking what they believed to be an appropriate and believable response?
When he almost killed a house full of children but was only concerned about how he looked. For our daughters ninth birthday party we let her have a sleep over with 5 other girls. The party was in late October so we were a little surprised to get a snowstorm bad enough to knock out the power. (we live in New Hampshire) Ok, so not the end of the world. We had a generator. Ex sets it up quickly and the power is back on. He says we are low on gas for it though and is going to take our 15 year old son with him to try and get more. What I didn't know at this point was that the generator was not outside in the driveway like it should be but inside our attached garage. I also later learned that our son had argued with him about this and told him it wasn't safe. But my ex isn't the type to listen t…

It's one of the few places where lots of people who are interested in it (for whatever reason) can ask questions, read answers, stories, etc. (embellished, truthful, completely made up, and everywhere in between) and get a pretty large amount of replies.
After awhile, it's not too hard to spot the jokers, fakes, and the like. So, if you truly have an interest in IQ, Quora isn't too bad of a place to browse.
Also, some on here really are as smart as they say — and, just the same, some care and some don't.
Cheers!

True. Staggering bet sizes is the weapon of the card counter. An AP includes peeking at sloppy dealer downcards when they peek, peeking at sloppy dealer when dealing, deceptive chip stacking when betting, etc.

Are there any tips for blackjack dealers when dealing with difficult players?
Mainly, remember you are always on camera and mostly some level of sound. The casino is a natural habitat for patrons to let loose and sometimes get out of hand. If it occurs, ensure to keep your form and table awareness high.. and if it just reaches an uncomfortable level, call over the floor manager/pit boss, etc.
Probability shows they were at fault, but feel comfortable in the fact that someone is ALWAYS watching :)

Good point, Jay. AML is an important (and IT wise, a royal pain) piece of the puzzle. One way casinos are cracking down is by not accepting chips from other casinos, having rfid chip inside the larger denom chips, and so on.

Great and accurate response. I started w all the iq groups early in life and found that, unless you're in a specific group of people (e.g., Mensa gathering), nobody wants to hear how smart you are. Seriously. I don't talk about it, ever, anymore. I post occasionally on some subjects where I have in depth knowledge (gaming, casinos, mental health primarily).
It's a fine line really breaking down “smart,” “IQ,” “intelligence,” and related buzzwords on an open, worldwide forum such as Quora.
As with most social apps, if you're smart, you've sifted through the garbage and set them up for your maximum benefit. Twitter gets a lot of flack, but have it filtered to what you want and it is almost a full day ahead of any newscast.
I mainly lurk, and find a lot of value here. I would guess there are many others that do the same :) cheers!

Finding a meaning of life ,I guess, only counts .many take his lives because they suffer from despair ,they could not get a meaning nor a goal of their existence..escaping from pain & suffering contributes but also in the depth, the person fails to have a meaningful context for such pain or any other negative event...Islam like other religions hardly digs into reality , all hijacked humanity to paradise! ..a magical type of thinking, fantasies are like drugs , relieving the imagined suffering .in another words, religions treat fantasy by another fantasy! .still in my opinion, religions are no longer the answer .

I heard there are new therapies for PTSD, depression and addiction. IV Ketamine therapy which is administered in a clinical setting under the supervision of a doctor and/ or a nurse. Some insurance company’s will pay a portion of the cost.

How many videos do top YouTubers create per year?
This definitely depends on their video frequency. While someone popular you tubers upload around once a month, others more than once a week.
Here’s Jenna Marbles;
she has 20+ million subscribers and she uploads once a week. Therefore, ~52 videos a year.
Then there’s Shane Dawson, who uploads less frequently, though in my opinion his quality of content (around an hour per video) makes up for it.
If you’re asking this as you’re starting a youtube channel, I’d recommend to upload frequently, so specific days, maybe once a week to keep viewers coming back.

What month of the year are the most beautiful people born?
From personal experience, I’d say October.
Why?
Well, I don’t know. I’ve never been the “pretty girl”, and though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the most beautiful people I have seen happened to be born in October.
Here are some stunning celebrities born in October:
Leigh-Anne Pinnock
Zack Efron
Gwen Stefani
Kira Kosarin
Alesha Dixon
Bella Hadid
And many more..

What does the red balloon mean in “IT”?
Source: This Might Be The Scariest Part Of The New Movie 'It' The terrifying new Stephen King adaptation of It has finally hit theaters, and it's safe to say the film may have ruined the usually light-hearted sight of clowns for a long while. Another way our psyches may be forever scarred is the use of red balloons and their meaning in It. Because it's not enough to have a demonic clown coming out of hiding to hurt the children of the sleepy town of Derry, Maine. No, It the clown has to use something very pleasant and ubiquitous, like a red balloon, to signal that he's watching you, waiting. Some background: It focuses its story on a band of pre-teen misfits who call themselves The Losers Club. Early in the film, one of the Losers, Bill, finds out that his little brother Georgie has gone mis…

How long does a YouTube video need to be to make to make you hesitate to watch?
This is my opinion, but atleast 8+ minutes. Anything below will most likely make me feel it is a waste of my time as they couldnt couldn't squeeze another 5 minutes of content, or will give the impression of click bait.¶

Though, youtube videos that are too long are also not great. Unless you’re they’re Shane Dawson or Jenna Marbles, I don’t want to watch a 30+ minute video of yours.¶

theirs.¶

Of course this is all subjective, and video length varies depending on what type of content you’re the youtuber is making. If you they were making regular youtuber style videos, such as vlogs, or Q&A’s / challenges, I’d keep it 8–15 minutes. If you’re their content is quality however, your their viewers would most likely prefer longer videos.

Is it possible to make socks and sandals look good?
Sure, It’s possible, though rare. This is just my opinion, but I feel white socks and maybe subtle, light coloured sandals could work, or the other way around. For example; If you’re going for that cute look. But most of the time, no. Socks and sliders = no. But, you do you. If you like socks and sandals, go for it. Life is too short to worry what others think. ~ Anna 💓…

The keychains are almost certainly phony, a greedy cynical effort to profit from human tragedy.
But how silly is it to believe it was Russia who invaded a neighboring sovereign state? How do we discount the reporting of BBC correspondents who witnessed the butchery committed in Bucha by Russian troops? How do you explain that?

What is back to basics in alcoholics anonymous?
It seems the question concerns a recovery book titled “Back to Basics”, a guidebook to a highly effective “program of action.” What is distinctive about this approach is that newcomers take all Twelve Steps in four one hour meetings. This method is merely a restoration of how the Steps were often taken in the 1940’s. The philosophy behind this strategy was best written at the behest of Dr. Robert Smith, one of the co- founders of Alcoholics Anonymous: ""It is important that the newcomer be introduced to the Twelve Steps at as early a date as possible….If you feel the Steps are a bit too complicated at first, you can introduce them to your (newcomer) in a simplified form, going into the complete program later.""

Should you tell people you're in AA?
I can only answer for myself and share my experience. It’s a personal choice and, in my opinion, “should or shouldn’t” does not apply. I withhold my identity at the level of public and social media (like Quora). That’s the essence of AA’s Tradition of Anonymity. Below the public level I make no secret of my participation in AA. I am willing at all times to share the experience, strength, and hope that I have been given through AA’s practical program of action. How would people know to ask me unless they know? I understand the fear of exposure to professional and social consequences, I was once very worried about stigma. Those fears turned out to be unfounded. As another person has already shared, there are other effective methods for tackling “the drink problem”, I even dabbled in a couple befo…

How can I communicate with wealthy people who are used to special treatment? I don't want to fawn over them, but I can't reach their communication level either.
Why seek to engage with those who demand special treatment? To do so only puts you at a disadvantage.
Just act naturally and respectfully. When we are comfortable and confident we are best able to overcome unfair demands. Oddly enough, this puts us in better position to engage effectively than meet anothers unreasonable demands.

We were having an alcohol-fueled evening when I asked my Sputnik guide for his impression of American students like myself.

My friend seems to have moved on but has offered me a place to stay. It seems like a good opportunity. How do I not feel like a third wheel?
Like it or not, you are the third wheel.
Assume friend has moved on to another interest. Now what? If you harbor any romantic notions either now or in the future, you will have a lot more discomfort to deal with than being self-conscious. That may sound harsh, but I would much rather step on your toes than see you make a choice that is almost certain to cause worse problems.

I feel your pain.
I have also lingered with loved ones as they endured seemingly endless and pointless agony.
l have no wisdom or insight that I can easily pass along. I have no glib words of comfort nor pearls of wisdom to assuage my own grief and anger.
All I have is our shared experience of being powerless in the moment, and grieving in the aftermath.
I have felt your pain, I am reliving a bit of my own.
I am sorry for your pain and I hope there is comfort ahead.

Many of the comments here are appalling, suggesting that those who made them may not have even read either the OP nor that of the person in the picture. Then again, some folks are just proof against anything contrary to their chosen point of view.
I live with someone who is massive, and who relies on carts such as the one in the picture. How he got so big is unknown to me, but now he has extensive arthritis, chronic pain, and a condition known as Charcot foot. These three challenges (among still others) render him unable to walk all but the shortest distance.
If we could just see the hidden issues that others contend with every minute of the day perhaps we might look upon others a little differently and accord them the dignity and grace we all need, deservedly or not.

Why would you give the benefit of the doubt to the people who stole this person’s dog? If they were as morally correct as you’re implying they would have taken the dog in and then made posters in the neighborhood posting the lost dog. A owner KNOWS their dog. She has the right to retrieve her dog.

Does it ever irritate you when people refer to someone they don’t know the gender of as her/him rather than them so that they are inclusive of all genders?
I’ve realized that cis ppl have the privilege to not see gender as a spectrum moreso black and white whereas we consider gender a clear spectrum and know that assuming is rude & imposing gender standards on a person is problematic regardless of how they present.

I started out the first two school terms badly, I continued the last two terms scoring high marks. What would colleges think of this?
I’m not an admissions officer but from my own personal experience you’ll be fine. I started High School with a 2.3 and ended with a 3.7 and got accepted to the #1 Historically Black College and University, Spelman College. Thanks to AP classes but it shows growth, hard work and dedication, which are all positive traits. Good luck in your schooling. What’s for you, will always be for you.

What made you change your field of study half way through college? Do you regret it?
Hello! I started my matriculation as aConputer science major although I loved my colleagues and I had a knack for IT, the program didn’t have what I really wanted and I didn’t feel like the mental stress and pressure was worth it, So I changed my major to political science and I’ve been as happy as anyone can be in this US political climate! I graduate in May and no I do not regret it!! Just think carefully about your goals and alternate routes to achieve what you want. I’m still tech savvy and code some but I don’t have the stress of programming for an degree.
