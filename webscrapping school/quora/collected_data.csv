perfect answer, I totally agree its never the other person its the person who your married to, the man must have promised her so much for him to act in a certain way how do I know because I have been through it my self……………. he promised me the world then I said to him show me I want action not just saying things verbally, the next day I never heard from him

you have a break when your dating but I don't believe that's right to say he wants a break from marriage, communicate with him on a higher level and ask for more clarification , what this all means to him

far from wrong I was a mistress me and the married man were so compatible in every way, there was a strong connection, he spoke very highly about his family and the wife the mother of his kids, and guess what there was never never ever sexual activity or money exchange or never promised me any thing only a comfort to talk to a person who understood him, hell yes there was a physical attraction and all but we were two adults who understood there is no point in hurting either party

YES I suffer from that and I refuse to take laxatives or any thing I do suffer from IBD, what helps is 1/2 glass of boiling water and squezzing lemon in the water drinking it first thing in the morning wait 20 minutes then eat as usual
another way is take a table spoon olive oil by mouth first thing in the morning wait 20 minutes and have your breakfast
another way is I eat papaya and kiwi fruit that guarantee to go
dates or prunes also

This boy told me he liked me. About a month later we started dating. This is when I find out that 2 days after he told me he liked me, he hung out with and kissed another girl. He’s apologized but I can’t seem to forgive. What do I do?
easy get rid of him, already a sign of CHEATING, and trust issues at least he did it early in the relationship and not 4 years later

I totally agree with you Roxana, couldn't have said it better, its not to be used as a punishment, how can you even enjoy the moment when he has shattered or upset you so much, when we make love we make it for a reason because you love your partner and content with where you are in life, we don't do it when we are tortured or upset and just make love and everything is alright....... that's why there are brothels were we have no feelings or emotions are attached

I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!

What has been the most gruesome real footage you've ever seen?
Hi. Let me tell you the story of Tatiane Spitzner and how her recorded death shocked the world and opened many eyes to what exactly domestic violence looks like. Tatiane was a 29-year-old lawyer who lived with her husband Luis Filipe in Guarapuava. Looking at pictures of the couple they looked like a happy and deeply in love couple: But behind these pictures hid a truly shocking reality that ended in a horrific way. On the 22nd of July, 2018, the couple went to a party and when they returned (at around 2:30 AM) they can be seen on CCTV parked in front of their building. They spoke for a little bit and then he suddenly hit her thrice, with considerable strength, in the head. She then tried to run and opened the door, but he forced her to close it and put her seatbelt around her neck, while grabbing her by the hair and punching her head repeatedly. Then they drove to the garage, he parked the car, got out, dragged her out and pushed her against the car. He then punched her throat causing her to pass out and fall to the ground. As she laid there he parked his car and two minutes later he came back and started kicking her until she woke up and got up. When she started regaining consciousness she decided to run for her life and she started running towards the elevator as he chased her. They both managed to get inside the elevator and she clicked the ground floor button instead of the fourth floor where they lived. When the elevator opened on the ground floor she tried to run, and managed to get out but he grabbed her and forced her back inside grabbing her and putting her against the wall until the door closed again. When they got to the fourth floor she put her hands on the sides of the elevator to try and stop him from forcing her to get out, but to no avail. When they left the elevator, it was the last time Tatiane was seen alive. When they got to their apartment, the neighbours heard her cries for help but did nothing. Less than 15 minutes later the camera outside the building filmed her body falling onto the floor. He claimed that she jumped by herself, but it's clear that's a lie because in the video we can see that she was not trying to block her face or even screaming. She was lifeless when she fell. He came downstairs, picked her up and took her to the elevator where he, covered in her blood, started to caress her face and covered her breasts. He took her back to their apartment and then came back and cleaned the blood from the elevator, before driving away. Dunia Rampazzo, a prosecutor on the case, stated: Our investigation proves that the victim was killed inside the apartment by asphyxiation and her body was thrown over the balcony of the apartment. We believe the accused then took the elevator to the ground floor and collected Tatiane’s body, taking it back up to the apartment in the elevator. We suspect that before she was killed, Luis subjected his wife to a prolonged period of violent physical aggression. This was not a suicide, but femicide. The aggressor then attempted to escape by car. The case had multiple delays due to covid, but in May this year, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. If you know someone who has an abusive partner or if you're in such a relationship, get help. Her death cannot be in vain, and it'll hopefully inspire those who need the inspiration to get out while they can. Thank you for reading.

My Zoe adopted me 2years ago when I moved into my apartment her previous owner wanted to put her down because she couldn't take her with her when she moved out, so I moved in with Zoe.
Zoe and I get on well she enjoys her space. Problem is Zoe doesn't allow me to sleep late. I wake up every morning at 5h30 and feed her get ready for work and leave at 7h00, if I get back into bed on a morning that I don't have to go to work she brings home birds she catches or she jumps on top of me meowing licking or biting me until I eventually give up and get out of bed. If I decide to take a nap infront of the TV she does the same.
How do I get Zoe to let me sleep late?

Yes. This. 1000%. I have my standards obviously in course I wouldn’t do it unless I was in excruciating pain so I could care less if the floor was clean or not when this happens to me. Last resort.

Thanks for the clarification. I was also wondering why they yelled at me to get off the floor when I was extremely ill. I had an awful fracture on my lower back and after 5 hours I could NOT sit in the hard chairs. So chairs any longer. I was out of my mind in pain but they didn’t care and I kept it to myself because there was nothing they were going to do. I just thought a different position would help even though yes, it was probably terribly unsanitary. I didn’t care. I just got on the floor. What can they do besides yell They yelled at you?me of course but I countered if you have a better solution I’m all ears. They didn’t.

Sadly I witnessed both. I was in a horrible hospital while in college dealing with breaking my arm and there was this psychotic woman having an huge break. Instead of treating her they just injected her with a bunch off different drugs until she stopped yelling. I interned in a psych ward before and I knew this was the completely wrong protocol! No restraints or watching her on camera. A few hours later the same staff tried waking her up for breakfast and she wouldn’t move. They kept yelling to get up but I knew the first time. It was really sad especially that none of these people were held accountable.

I don’t think anyone gets to judge Marilyn Monroe unless you lived her life and walked in her shoes. Her mother was mentally unstable causing her aunt to care for her. When she finally made a life for herself from modeling to acting, most men, directors mostly, took advantage of her and didn’t pay her anything near what she deserved compared to her men counterparts. Most deserved in diamonds is a girls best friend. Marilyn never even got paid for being playboy of the year. She paid for her mother to receive the best care. It’s not talked about often, but she inherited her mother’s mental illness as well and was suicidal about it. She took a lot of pills and alcohol which is how she passed. Albeit whatever allegations about the dirty dishes and IBS, where were the maids to take care of the dishes and sheets?

Have you ever been rude to someone and thought that you were right in doing so?
Not sure if it is considered rude. I Just responded in kind. This was several decades ago. As a child, and into my mid twenties I was naturally very skinny. Not underweight but skinny. Well, one day, I was coming home from work. I was about 22 years old or so.. This overweight woman, with moles on her face, about 50 or so, says to me-""You are so skinny, you need to eat something. You would look so much better with some meat on your bones.” Mind you, I worked at a restaurant at that time. I ate 2 meals there everyday. I had bacon and eggs, and for lunch I had fish, and pasta. And-I was going to have dinner later, at home So, her comment was ridiculous. I was just a skinny healthy 22 year old, who was naturally skinny. How I miss those days! Well, I lost it with her. I said- ""You should really lose some weight. You should eat less. You would look so much better with some meat off your bones. You should have those moles on your face checked, and removed, you would look better. Are we done exchanging advice complete stranger?” She just sat on the bench and gawked at me. The bus arrived, and she got on first and sat in the front. As, I got on, the bus, the handsome bus driver looks at me and says, you're a pretty girl. A boy about my age smiles at me. The big lady, heard the bus driver, and saw the youngman smile at me. I was just a skinny, 22 year-old in blue jeans and a Tee-Shirt, and no makeup. As I walked by the advice lady when I got off the bus. I smiled at her, and said you have a great day now. She rolled her eyes, and didn't respond. I was a bit harsh, with her, but, her commenting negatively on my personal appearance, was just inappropriate. Her making an inaccurate asumption, that I didn't eat, and telling me what I need to do, was, hurtful,, and disrespectful. I know she thought twice about what she said to people after that.

What are you talking about? Anorexia definitely is otherwise they wouldn’t consult psych in the first place. According to the dsm it is definitely a psychiatric condition. I’m not talking about appetite loss. I’m talking about being a small person already who has severe weight loss. That raises eyebrows unfortunately that strays away from my main medical issues. My doctor typical will not prescribe pain medication because it creates nausea.

It’s a joke for me. I’ve suffered for years with documented GI problems however whenever I show up to the er it’s a hit or miss situation. Sometimes they give me what I need other times they won’t. With my condition it also causes a lot of weight loss so they love to throw in a psych diagnosis of anorexia.

It might be cheaper however depending on numerous factors such as taking into account how long the flight is- I’d say 8 hours or more, which airline it is, certain amenities, most importantly if you have medical conditions where you just cannot sit straight for hours on end. Some things you can’t put a price on. I’m not an extremist and say blow $20k for emirates but a practical price especially if you have the capability to use mileage to upgrade.

It’s hard to pick one.. I recently had a tech picking on me. I don’t know why she didn’t like me but she was a straight up bully. I have serious GI issues such as gastroparesis which constantly flares and causes extreme vomiting. When I was admitted to the er I went to the bathroom and all of a sudden she starts banging on the door telling me to get out. I was literally hovering over the toilet saying lady don’t F&ck with me. I’ve never been more furious in my life. I ended up reporting her to hr. I’ll find out later what happened.

I’m trying to figure out if my mom has dementia or a “selective memory”. She does not use I statements, take any accountability for mistakes made on her part, however Will apologize with complete sarcasm and turn the tables. I don’t even consider them mistakes at this point. It’s was pure negligence in my case letting me go so long without physical care because school was more important. Yes I graduated high school at the top of my class getting all A’s. Yes I went to an Ivy League. But at what cost? I am 31 have severe kidney failure, osteoporosis, gastroparesis, etc, because as a kid she refused to listen to me if something was wrong. “Yes I was making up all my ailments as early as 3 years old” if anything I can stay it made me stronger to deal with such a person like that from the start.

I have gastroparesis which includes several trips to er due to flare ups. There is no cure and many people are not educated on it. I once had an admission and could not stop vomiting and while vomiting the dr said I must like attention. I was really angry and still am. I haven’t forgotten that. You can’t cause this but shame on medical professionals who don’t act professional.

As a patient, what's the angriest you have ever been toward a doctor?
Oh so many to count: * The doctor who assumed my swollen face and rash was from makeup and he literally took a coffee break while I sat waiting. Turns out it was a severe reaction to a spider bite. Figured that one out when my throat swelled shut and I couldn’t breathe. * The doctor who literally rolled his eyes when I was trying to describe severe gut pain. He thought it was “just a bug”. Turns out it was an acute pancreatitis attack. It took 8 doctors and 8–1/2 months to get a proper diagnosis because every doctor dismissed my pain and description of symptoms. * The doctor who told me “I was just a slow healer” when I described continuing severe pain after my total knee replacement. A year later a new doctor diagnosed the problem: It’d torn a tendon during physical therapy. My knee swung back and forth sideways like a clock pendulum. I had to have a second total knee replacement because the damage had healed and couldn’t be repaired any other way. * The ER doctor who was killing time until retirement so often went to breakfast, leaving patients to wait. I was peeing blood. He was eating eggs and bacon at a nearby diner. * The gynecologist who told me I had a “swollen ovary” and to wait 2–3 months even though the pain was so bad I couldn’t even stand up straight. Turned out to be a grapefruit-sized tumor that had caused ovarian torsion (twisted fallopian tube). The doctor who believed me and agreed to a “second opinion” examination wouldn’t even let me leave. They wheeled me across the parking lot directly into surgery. He said the tumor was so close to rupturing I could easily have died. There are probably millions of stories in the US about dismissive, arrogant, incompetent doctors. Especially for women. US doctors are notorious for not listening to women.

I had the same experience. My ex and I were together for 10 years. He had 3 kids but his eldest was completely nefarious. He promised that went she went away to college things would change but they never did. She treated her own blood family like garbage even though they paid for everything but not including she already had a trust fund. At the end of college it was covid and she started working from home. At that time, I had suffered enough emotionally and psychologically abuse and panic attacks from her narcissism and her nastiness and so did her father because she refused to get her own place. After a period of time and no matter what happened my ex said I might hate her but she’s my daughter I can’t divorce her. That was the end of my relationship.

I can relate to some extent. I have gastroparesis and literally cannot eat or swallow anything anymore so they always accuse me of having anorexia because my weight is really low.

actually I’m allergic to most emetics they cause dystonia. For my episodes they have to knock me out me with something strong through iv. Even though it’s in my notes they just do not understand what gastroparesis is since it’s not common. I hate my hospital. The last time I was there I was kept in the waiting room for 5 hours vomiting non stop until I had a tear and it started eroding. When they admitted finally, this dr I never met came in and the first thing she saw was “I like attention” I couldn’t answer because I was still vomiting. I was so confused but too in pain to be angry at the moment.

Unfortunately not all cats are smart or instinctive. Especially conpared compared to unbelievably genius dogs like border collies and poodles. poodles that aren’t aggressive dogs. This one cat (don’t know the breed) but got simply chased outside and fell into the pool and drowned (by its own doing). Cats may know how to claw and scratch but they don’t know how to swim.

I call him a few days later to remind him, he asks who I am which isn’t too surprising because he has a ton of patients, doesn’t take insurance and wants to be paid in cash. We go over my med list for the thousandth time like something has changed. After 7 minutes he says I have to go bye and hangs up on me. I am literally so inconceivably angry I have no words. I don’t mind the money if he actually does something useful. But nothing. He texts he later for a less than a 15 session he wants 175.

He got upset with that and said well if that’s your situation then maybe you should see another doctor. I had no problem with that. I know he’s just in it for the money considering I had one session where he was getting a facts about one of his patients being incarcerated.
Mainly I was upset because he was committing malpractice and didn’t care. I have severe insomnia and that’s what I needed to talk about more in-depth. The fact of the matter is he didn’t care when I told him I have low blood pressure and he was prescribing me a low blood pressure pill that was making it worse. I kept saying no you can’t do that. I already have low blood pressure and I have been admitted several times. He didn’t care or listen, just said well I’m gonna up the dose. I tried to tell him but he literally would not listen.

Is it normal for a narcissistic mother to be nice one day and the next a horrible person again? Or even just a time space of 1 minute to a few months?
Oh it’s more than normal. That’s how they live. Although I rarely saw my mother “nice” except to other people. I’ll just say quiet for us. We would never make it to months. A few minutes later she would be yelling or criticizing me or my sibling for something completely asinine. We eventually just stopped talking to her. She is a npd fucked up nut job who takes no culpability for any of the horrible things she done. No remorse.

Yeah school was hard. I hate saying “mom” or mother even because it’s too painful so I’ll just say X. She never tried to figure out what was wrong with me even after multiple ER visits.

It’s good to know that in someway, I’m not This might be long but it’s worth the only one at odds with NOT just someone in my family, but a grandparent almost my entire life.read.
Here’s the story:
On my paternal side I had amazing grandparents. They survived WW2 and immigrated to Israel with the rest of their family who survived. Some didn’t make it. The story alone brings so many tears to my face and what they went through. I literally try not to hate anyone but I will Never accept people that do not believe that the holocaust ever happened. I didn’t know my grandma (safta) much as she passed when I was three but I remember her and her memory very well. Her kindness and what little I do remember still brings me joy. My grandfather aka saba was literally the most immeasurable man I ever knew in my life and looked up to. We didn’t talk about it much but one of his brothers was shot to death right in front of him. I couldn’t even imagine how he had the courage to move forward and keep going but he did. To see what he overcame in his stories and lived on to have worked several jobs to support his family and kids despite what happened to him at such a young age is inconceivable. He also was a talented artist, he spoke several languages, up to 5, and he just had a heart of gold. Most of all he was just patient and kind. He unfortunately passed from cancer when I was about 14. He could not be at my bat mitzvah since he was so sick so we streamed it to him and it literally made him light up. The irony is that these are the grandparents that I didn’t get to see very often because they lived in Israel and I live lived in the states. To this day I am still so angry livid at my mom for choosing where we had to live and so is my dad (he is Israeli and that is his homeland)¶

homeland) where all our REAL family lives.¶

Now on maternal side, I never met my grandfather because he died 7 to 8 years before I was born. It was mentioned at some point he didn’t really have the patience for children anyway. My mom doesn’t talk about him too much except that he loved the piano. piano and was very musical. With that being said, I do have a grandmother who is still alive. She is 94 94 but looks 65 65 with all her work done. I could post a picture but I refuse to live in the vapidity. She actually has gotten mistaken for Joan Rivers at the airport before. The Multiple times….The reason I don’t get along with her well is because nepotism. simply nepotism. She has five grandchildren grandchildren, including me, I’m last, and now two new great grandchildren. All she cares about is the almighty dollar. She rates us mainly on how much is in our bank account, what ivy we attended, who we married, etc. Her first born golden boy son is a executive CEO of a multi million dollar company. I’m not going to mention my mom or the other sibling. But the fact of the matter is he’s her first born son had done some pretty bad stuff and felonious things in his childhood that were clearly not within the limits of stealing candy or anything of that nature. Obviously the statue of limitations has run out and I’m not going to say specifically. I’m just going to say it had a HUGE impact and strain on my life. He’s gotten away with it and it, because at an older age he suddenly decided to become pious as ever, donates at least 6 figures to his congregation, she just doesn’t care because all she sees is money. dollar signs. I’ve only seen her maybe 10 times in my entire life and I’m approaching 30 now. When I have seen here they are called “duty visits” because it’s only done because it’s something that she feels she has to do. obligated to do, like a check list. Not because she truly wants to. She only spends time with the grandchildren with the most money. My mother denies this but it is completely true. true considering she even calls them “duty visits”. This one time I had cousins coming down from Chicago at the time and she chose to spend time with them over me. I have a older sister that has cut her out off of her life years ago because all she wants to do is gossip and then spread it around to other family members which is totally not right. Note toxic. As for me, I would prefer it to be that way or keep it on the most basic level. For now it’s not available. I’ve cut my mom out of every doctor appointment, labs, surgery, and as a an emergency contact. I have a ton of medical issues so and as much as I try to keep them private, my mom talks about me all the time even though I keep asking pleading with her not to. For example I was in a I grew up really bad car accident in May. No drugs drinking or speeding. I happened to have mature to begin with, from all of my rather “anomalous” family situations and with my medical conditions. I had really low blood pressure severe nerve damage when I was born that caused several problems I wouldn’t know about until several years later. The only thing I knew I had besides the nerve problem was gastroparesis. It is a stomach condition which caused me to not want to eat anything because I couldn’t digest it correctly. It started out as ARFID (DSM-5) of not wanting food because I would start getting physically sick but eventually evolved into full blown anorexia. I know I can’t blame anyone for it but it certainly didn’t help that the times I did see my grandmother, all of a sudden and my car hit a curb and suddenly it turned over. This was my first accident ever. In 16 she did was fat shame people in front of me. She even told another family member in front of me to not wear shorts anymore because they’re legs did not look good in them. I’ve had multiple treatments and I think it’s something I’m mostly over but the fat shaming is still a big part of my family. Ironically enough, I became a dietitian. My mom did eventually bring it up it up to her several years of driving. I was in my neighborhood and was able to call home on my car phone. Before paramedics arrived. Of course my mom told my grandmother. She didn’t ask if I was ok. Just that I was a really bad driver and don’t think about getting me another car. later and she still denies the correlation between her words and my condition. I feel really bad for saying this even, but I think about it all the time. Why did I lose the best grandparents and she is all I have left? I don’t care about the will whatsoever or anything because I don’t expect to be included. There is no amount of money that could justify anything. I just wish I had my loving grandparents still here.

My grandfather aka saba was literally the most immeasurable man I ever knew in my life and looked up to. We didn’t talk about it much but one of his brothers was shot to death right in front of him. I couldn’t even imagine how he had the courage to move forward and keep going but he did. To see what he overcame in his stories and lived on to have worked several jobs to support his family and kids despite what happened to him at such a young age is inconceivable. He also was a talented artist, he spoke several languages, and he just had a heart of gold. He unfortunately passed cancer when I was about 14. He could not be at my bat mitzvah since he was so sick so we streamed it to him and it literally made him light up. The irony is that these are the grandparents that I didn’t get to see very often because they lived in Israel and I live in the states. To this day I am still so angry at my mom for choosing where we had to live and so is my dad (he is Israeli and that is his homeland)
Now on maternal side, I never met my grandfather because he died 7 to 8 years before I was born. It was mentioned at some point he didn’t really have the patience for children anyway. My mom doesn’t talk about him too much except that he loved the piano. With that being said, I do have a grandmother who is still alive. She is 94 but looks 65 with all her work done. She actually has gotten mistaken for Joan Rivers at the airport before. The reason I don’t get along with her well is because nepotism. She has five grandchildren and now two new great grandchildren. All she cares about is the almighty dollar. Her first born golden boy son is a executive CEO of a multi million dollar company. I’m not going to mention my mom or the other sibling. But the fact of the matter is he’s done some pretty bad stuff and gotten away with it and she just doesn’t care because all she sees is money. I’ve only seen her maybe 10 times in my entire life and I’m approaching 30 now. When I have seen here they are called “duty visits” because it’s only done because it’s something that she feels she has to do. Not because she wants to. She only spends time with the grandchildren with the most money. My mother denies this but it is completely true. I have a sister that has cut her out off her life years ago because all she wants to do is gossip and then spread it around to other family members which is totally not right. Note for me, I have a ton of medical issues so my mom talks about me all the time even though I keep asking her not to. For example I was in a really bad car accident in May. No drugs drinking or speeding. I happened to have had really low blood pressure all of a sudden and my car hit a curb and suddenly it turned over. This was my first accident ever. In 16 years of driving. I was in my neighborhood and was able to call home on my car phone. Before paramedics arrived. Of course my mom told my grandmother. She didn’t ask if I was ok. Just that I was a really bad driver and don’t think about getting me another car. I feel really bad for saying this even, but I think about it all the time. Why did I lose the best grandparents and she is all I have left? I don’t care about the will whatsoever or anything because I don’t expect to be included. I just wish I had my loving grandparents still here.

After a certain time, no matter how many laxatives magnesium sitrate or enema you give yourself it’s simply will not work. The stool is simply just too hard from being up there from so long and and enema can’t even reach that far. It’s best that you go to the ER to see whether or not you have a bowel impaction. They can see how much fecal matter you have and based on that, treat that rather appropriately and quickly to relieve your discomfort.

My mother was born in the fifties her brother in 49, and the last sibling in in the fifties too. I know back in this time. Fathers really couldn’t go in the room or anything. As far as I know her mother had a nanny or nurse taken care of each child up into a certain age.

You know nothing about trauma or memory. I was 3 years old already having the brink of an eating disorder currently known by the DSM-5 as arfid, which led into full blown anorexia. I remember being at relatives house and my dad broke something, knowing about my college fund I begged them not to take it from there.

I too have had a unpleasant experience with a nurse or two. A was having neck spasms with extreme pain causing it too be completely stiff to one side. My neck was twisted to one side either completely left or right at the time and it would budge. It looked pretty odd not to mention the agony I was going through WITHOUT pain meds at the time. The nurse on my shift was literally treating me as if it was fake and that I could move my neck. She kept asking me, rudely, to move my neck to the proper position forward and this I could not do. I remember I got really thirsty and could barely reach what little water there was. When I did grasp the cup I was drinking sideways and I started aspirating, and she didn’t respond. Another nurse checked on me and helped. I literally counted the hours, actually minutes until the nurse changed shifts. I finally got a muscle relaxer that relieved the nerve pain and stiffness. I found out later that the neck condition was caused by an allergic reaction to medication causing a condition known as cervical dysontia. Anyways yes some nurses are just nasty and shouldn’t be nurses.

I understand it’s important to have everything to be cleaned out which is why they give you that big jug and peg solution however I was wondering if it was necessary to drink it all especially if you only weigh a certain weight and cannot tolerate a certain amount of food or fluids without being ill.
asking this question was because most of the time I don’t or I really can’t eat anything because of my Gastro situation. If I do eat it’s mainline liquid and that’s it or some thing really low caloric like fruit so grapes or cherries. Less than 1/4 cup, if that. I really can’t eat without getting violently sick. I feel better for my stomach when I don’t eat because there’s no vomiting or anything like that. I’m still very young towards my late 20s and my doctor hasn’t given me a reason why I need to have a colonoscopy albeit, I’ve done several endoscopy's. i’m struggling to find the urgency for this. Why is it so important if I’m so young. Yes I have a lot of G.I. issues but i’ve never heard of a colonoscopy being able to fix anything. I know I don’t have polyps or anything like that. I’m just mainly wondering what I can expect out of this.

Why am I not losing weight like I did previously? I’m a late 20s female. Nothing has changed. I’ve always been thin, petite, and been able to lose weight quickly. In addition, I have not been able to exercise in a few years because I have osteoporosis. I have severe GI problems that limits so many foods, that eating is just so unpleasant. Last year I went down from 98 to 85 in 2 1/2 months or less. I started at 96 this time a week or so ago and I’m only down to 92. It’s not a race I just want to know why I’m not losing when I’m not really eating anything.

What ingredients should we have in our toothpaste?
The most important ingredient in your toothpaste is called fluoride. It protects and builds enamel on your teeth. You will also find potassium nitrate, which helps reduce tooth sensitivity. Other important ingredients include pyrophosphates and triclosan. These reduce tartar, gingivitis, and bad breath. As your dentist will tell you, these ingredients are crucial to effective dental care. They will help you maintain healthy teeth between your dental exams and teeth cleanings.

I mean, I hid my meth addiction from my boyfriend who I lived with for 2 whole years before I finally broke down and told him.
He said he had no idea, but that he wasn’t exactly that surprised when he thinks back about how I was always so energetic, able to work 3 jobs without a complaint, and how little sleep I needed to function normally compared to most people… lol.
So, unless you’ve been smoking it around him or being blatantly and obviously tweaked out, maybe he just thinks you have a quirky personality 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have been trying to figure out why I am the way I am my entire life. Constantly trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Or if there even is anything actually wrong with me. Maybe I’m just more weak, less adequate, less worthy of a person than most.
I relate pretty heavily to every single one of these. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember so I was confused at first, because I just considered them my norm… even though my norm also consists of knowing that these traits make me feel the very opposite of “normal”.
Anyway. It was oddly comforting to read this list, written by someone else, when it feels like it could have come from my brain. Thank you for taking the time to write it.

It’s only been a week for me but I already feel like I have a huge weight lifted off my shoulders .. for some reason I keep thinking about him and blaming myself for the downfalls in our relationship although I know I tried my hardest to make him happy it was truely impossible to do … no appreciation for anything I ever did … just expected it and it still was never good enough

I am so sorry for what happened. Please seek an attorney to fight your rights over your child if you are fully fit to care for the minor.
When you finally get partial, or full custody, never take out your frustration on your kid, just give him all your love, respect, discipline, and support. Kids are smart, they will figure out where the dysfunction is at.
In regards to the heart ache, please find a way to improve your relationships, stay healthy, spiritual and grateful towards life. Let them deal with the karma of their decisions. But you keep showing up for yourself and your kid no matter what.
Best of luck 🙏

What are the most terrifying displays of intelligence by animals?
A lioness made a big kill but got remorseful. After realizing the antelope she had killed was pregnant, the lioness removed the unborn calf and tried to shake it back to life. Her behavior was unlikely for a lioness who made a huge kill and it seemed she was clearly disturbed by what she had done and kept on looking around as if to look for a way to bring back her kill to life. She made attempts to feed on her catch but suddenly stopped. She appeared to have lost her appetite. Overcome with grief she lay by the side of the dead antelope. It takes intelligence to be remorseful. The sequence of events was recorded by Gerry Van Der Walt who is a wildlife photographer. * Here is a space, Bizarre stories, where I share very strange real-life stories from around the world.

As the human brain is more complex than a supercomputer, why do we struggle to compute seemingly simple math problems in our heads?
Your brain handles many multi-variable partial differential equations in your head in real time, effortlessly. You can walk down the street on uneven pavement, toss a ball in the air, and catch it. To do this, you are computing balance, coordinating hundreds of muscles in a dynamic system to keep you upright and stable, while simultaneously solving vector momentum problems instantaneously— not only calculating the trajectory of the ball, but calculating the trajectory of your hand to intersect the trajectory of the ball. Your brain can solve problems that look like this, nearly instantly with no conscious effort: You just can’t solve those problems consciously when they’re written in abstract language, without effort.

What is the worst idea that mankind ever came up with?
My vote is landmines. Not because they aren’t effective. But because they get left behind. There are many thousands of landmines still sitting under the dirt, waiting to go off. And, contrary to what movies say, a landmine doesn’t click and then explode. It just explodes, taking you and anyone nearby with it. A buried landmine can remain active for more than 50 years after being placed. Many mines are still floating in the ocean, waiting to sink a ship. In Ukraine, they have been finding these: They are butterfly landmines and extremely dangerous. Russia placed them. So at this point, there needs to be some sort of agreement to stop using them in warfare. They kill people decades later. It’s a dirty weapon.

And let's not forget the time when they went through with her high school graduation party even though they'd been informed by school authorities that young Casey hadn't attended school for most of the year and she wasn't graduating. Yet she got her party, gifts and a free pass with absolutely no accountability for her actions. Casey is responsible for baby Caylee's senseless death but Casey's parents are responsible for paving the way for this disgusting monster. What did they get in the end? A daughter who hated them so much and felt so entitled that she stole money from her parents, friends and grandma,and murdered her own daughter just because she wanted to party, do drugs and screw around but she was too jealous of her own baby to give her up for others to raise. She “allegedly” lied about her father raping her since she was a minor to justify her reaction to her daughter's “disappearance”. Well, she's a nutjob and I could write a book describing all of her pathetic attitudes but this is a comment section. I feel so sad for baby Caylee. No justice was served for her although ALL the circumstantial evidence pointed clearly and directly towards this poor excuse of a mother. I'm sorry you got such an incompetent mom Caylee.

I see what you mean. Maybe something else a woman might find attractive in a mate who is into these kinds of sports is discipline too. She obviously had her issues because people who deceive are commonly insecure individuals. BUT a tool that helped me a lot in understanding what made me always end up in the losing side of a sad, mediocre “romantic"" story with each guy I chose was searching for the bug inside my OS. After grueling sessions of brutal honesty, I realized I was attracting flies because I hadn't cleaned my garbage. I seriously don't mean to say hurtful things to OP but it seems to me like he was also insecure but his issues made him fail to respect himself enough to set healthy boundaries. Maybe he already figured and sorted that out but if not, or if anyone else is wondering, you begin searching through your pain and follow that lead until you arrive the core issue. Follow the “stench"" within. LMAO

I‘m a freshman and my family is really poor. I get bullied because of it. A boy who bullies me (he’s a junior) wants to pay me $100 if I‘d be his punching bag for 30 minutes. Should I do it? That’s a lot of money.
The hospital bill and health repercussions might surpass that amount (not to mention you will lose your self respect and others won't respect you). It's cheaper to just not let their opinion matter to you. Study smart and hard, have the best personal hygiene possible, stay organized an minimalist; don't buy several cheap things, candy, chips and other non nutritional foods, instead save up your money to buy good quality products at reasonable prices (even wait for sales), be kind and courteous to all people and exercise; having these mindful practices will put you in a position of control and order where there is much chaos, then you can think about your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT assessment); having a clear view of your intrinsic components as well as the extrin…

Ladies and gentlemen allow me to present to you: TOXIC HUMAN BEHAVIOR. Being so entitled literally for existing in your condition, you believe you're automatically superior to other human beings of different innate condition. Brought to us by the same ego traps that brought us: Slavery of humans with more melanin, Colonization,The Holocaust, etc. Us women are capable of evil actions just like men and not holding us accountable is a despicable form of sexual discrimination some women have come up with to boost their ego and/or avoid accountability and it might seem convenient for us but in the end, people who aren't held accountable for their actions lose the opportunity to learn and grow, so… Always seeking paternal treatment? Ewww I'd rather just be an adult in the streets and an occasional brat (consensually and respectfully) with my partner. IDK man I just like gentlemen who can deal with it but I'm honest about it. :v

I think I understand your POV. Many men (usually with poor or none healthy masculine figure in their lives) misunderstand the components to a gentleman's character. TV shows have portrayed a very unhealthy “gentleman figure"" to appeal to the feminine audience by tickling the spoiled girl bone. But don't be fooled, a gentleman is not a rug if he honestly behaves like one and he'd know a lady when he talks to one. If a man is easily manipulated, paraded and screwed over he's not a gentleman, he's a simp.

I feel that weed has been super useful to me as far as curing my depression but only because along with it, I have been researching for years to figure out my blind spots. So it's not that weed by itself has cured me, but it helped take the weight off my head during the high and put me in a much more open state of mind so I could think with a different perspective and I know it sounds horrible if you're judging but when I had no reason to get out of bed, getting high was a pretty good shot; this is how I feel it became addictive to me but if I had something exciting to do, I could go without smoking it and not feel withdrawal. I just miss it when my sorroundings overwhelm me and I want to take off to the moon :)
But since I have made so much progress curing my depression I have been considering to switch because I want to change behaviour patterns and weed makes it slower for me. Hopefully when I get used to the changes I can start again with a more efficient mindset and behaviour.
Update Aug/30/2020: I haven’t smoked weed since Jan, decided to quit weed and alcohol because I realized our relatioship was keeping me stuck in a heodnistic loop lacking the level of self awareness I know I need to achieve my goals. Have been feeling low in energy and a bit neurotic but am sticking to my guns, trying to parent myself with discipline, patience and love am going through a rough patch but I know I’m strong and I’ll get through.

What’s troubling and horrifying about intrusive thoughts in people who struggle with a personality disorder is they have no chill. You might be with granny having a nice cup of tea in the porch and all of a sudden have mental images of jamming the butter knife in her eye, or you’re with your baby and picture smashing him or her against a wall. You don’t even have to be a violent person to have these thoughts and they are horrifying because they come without warning and you turn off your emotions to deal with how exausting it is to battle searching for evidence of how you’re not that monster and you’d rather cut your hands off before hurting others. But they lurk… And you secretly fear the next one. It’s like and anxious and fearful issue.

I feel that self deprication can be successful in conveying humour if used in situations where it is obviously a joke and a witty one, for instance a professor who is a good lecturer is an intelectual authority so that position plus the short punchline makes it funny. It wouldn't be the case if he had said something to convey he was feeling nervous about the event or unprepared. I don't think that gender has much to do with the result but rather the witiness and self confidence a person has to deliver humour. That's the key, humour has a sweet spot; it is actually a form of intellectual exercise.exercise. That's why when overconfident GTL ambassador Mike: “The Situation” roasted Trump on Comedy Central it was painful to watch and the audience was actually bullying his unaware soul to GTFO, it doesn't seem like the man reads a lot ya feel me?

After reading a fatal news from Brazil about the kidnapping of a 1 year old gone wrong (the halfwit kidnapper couldn't stand the baby crying so apparently, he thought it was best to dismember her and demand the rescue money in exchange of her remains.) I just woke up from a nightmare of my baby girl missing. I was not able to get back to sleep so, naturally I made a Quora search related to kidnappings. I was looking for tips to avoid/ respond to a situation like this, but your post was so beautiful to read that now I can go back to sleep. I'll for sure resume my research on how to become Liam Nison in the morning. But thankyou because your starlight starlit hammock-swung reflection has given me an unexpected sense of peace. I'm glad your experience was less horrifying than many others, I'm glad you got to hug your family again and I'm glad that you were able to hone the skill of reflecting on a bigger picture. You obviously learned your father's emotional wisdom, this inspires me to provide my daughter and son with tools to roll with the punches because we can't always avoid suffering. May you lead a prosperous life.

You have been so helpful, I feel like I have a mix of anxious and avoidant attachment. Reading your insights has given peace to me because now I know it was all my responsibility so it is all under my control. I have a lot of digging and reprogramming to do. Especially for my two babies this last dysfunctional relationship gave me. <3
Btw, THANKYOU!

To answer the initial question, yes; to an extent I do feel like and outsider most of the time… As an observer, you tend to be (I'm not complaining). Then comes the part where I know I'm no different from everything than two grains of sand from each other; to this extent, I feel like part of a vast whole. Integrated but still individual. Perfect.
To answer your question… I have no idea. I get a lot of good attention from romantics but I have never had a long term peaceful relationship. People find it interesting and new at first and then expect you to change. Morons… Maybe I am the moron… I don't yet understand love to an intuitive level so a very important piece of data is missing from my report. Your wife is very smart to have found someone who gets her.

Great advice! I have been working on my mindset and a huge part of it has to do with treating my Ego the way she needs to be treated, with respect but without giving it power over my whole “us”. Lately, some stuff has happened that I didn't know how to handle and I felt Ego take over… Now I notice the difference and the damage. I have to get back on track because Ego is like a spoilt 5yr old brat driving an 18 wheeler. You'll crash your whole self. I had a panic attack yesterday while driving and almost passed out. Dear Ego, you're going back to your rightful place.

How come at the Zen center I go to they have me, and other newer members, face the wall and count our breaths up to 10 and then start over while other members get koans, is this because we are new?
Hi! I'm no expert but I'll take a shot at it… I see it this way: When I practice yoga, I have a hard time keeping the right breath pace, throughout the day I notice sometimes how my stomach urges an abrupt signal through my chest, up to my nostrils to squeeze in as much air as possible to fill the lack of oxygen my brain craves. The average human tends to be a “shallow breather”. This means we take slow soft breaths with our confortably flaccid muscles. In return, our body is not getting the full dosage of oxigen each tissue needs to live therefore, shallow breathing can stress your systems. Since breathing awareness and mastery is a vital part of meditation (which is a huge part of Zen), they are probably expecting you to do it like you would any other training, as proficient as possible. So…

N. I can see you feel angry, frustrated, scared, guilty… I empathize with you.
Now, let's focus on avoiding unnecessary suffering; “When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.”
Question each limiting belief you have. Is it true? How is it true? How could it not be true? How can it be both? Could the fittest-in-every-way man in the world rewire his thought patterns to fix it? How would he do it? What kind of thoughts does he need to train his mind to have in order to be the one who can?
It's really a matter of who you want to be, once you choose, forget all doubt and keep going ALWAYS towards the You →you want to be. Be mindful and present in your feelings and how you filter your thoughts.
I try not to see it as good or bad; what will make your life better in the long run?
One interesting idea that came to my mind is: “We still don't have enough information about anything to make up our minds; everything changes with time and we discover new intel. I know you all love her so much, in an ideal world you picture her fulfilling her life how we see happy “normal” women do. It hurts to know she will probably never be able to take care of herself or fall in love, have sex, be a mother, etc. BUT maybe she doesn't even think about those things” .
You know your life so you feel her situation is unbearable, you feel she suffers the way you would… The thing is, her experience of your type of life is probably just as unknown to her as hers is to you.
THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
Picture you living with your family, except they all act like your sis. You can't seem to comunicate your needs, wants and thoughts easily… Your joy is all in your mind and so is your pain because your mind is an isolated patch of uncharted territory and with no one to help you understand because maybe you have a code but no one can speak it's language.
*****
Maybe it would be a little more bearable by the day if you start making little tweaks each time you can in your perspective of who your sister is, who she wants to be and who you want to be to her. If you want to just forget about it all because you feel that will make your life better, then do it and make sure you find peace and happiness in your own path without looking back. If you feel there is something new you can try each time and you feel you have the need to keep exploring this way that involves your sister, then try to understand her mind -whichever her level of consciousness might be- , talk to the staff that takes care of her and pick their brains, be kind to them and grateful, tell them things that will help them love her, approach her with curiosity and no expectations. Don't feel bad or embarrassed if she throws a tantrum, people's opinions will always be outside your control and usually uninformed. Shake it off, she is no ordinary person so if you visit her, don't expect an ordinary exchange. Don't expect verbal language, observe her interact with the world available to her and offer a smile. You don't have to have it all figured out, let people help as much as you need and is available and you focus on gathering intel and process it like scientists process data. There are no two same experiences of life, we all see it from within, so look.
Look at those beautiful green eyes alive. Smile always. “Smeyes” are kind of universal signs for friendliness and good vibes (unless it's the “I'm gonna eat you alive” kind of smile, yikes!).
Anyways, I hope your life is awesome. Believe in yourself, whatever your choice is, “be brave, stay wild”.
Best wishes!

We're mostly grumpy when sorrounded by “idiots” with no sense of formal logic or when people invade disrespectfuly our mental space/projects; confronted by the fact that deeeeeeeeeep down, we love humanity.
Bonus: if you're a victimist, a manipulator, belief driven or abusive, stay away from INTPs… People with predominant irrational behaviors and no openness to improve make us cringe and we'd never fuck you willingly.

I feel that weed has been super useful to me as far as curing my depression but only because along with it, I have been researching for years to figure out my blind spots. So it's not that weed by itself has cured me, but it helped take the weight off my head during the high and put me in a much more open state of mind so I could think with a different perspective and I know it sounds horrible if you're judging but when I had no reason to get out of bed, getting high was a pretty good shot; this is how I feel it became addictive to me but if I had something exciting to do, I could go without smoking it and not feel withdrawal. I just miss it when my sorroundings overwhelm me and I want to take off to the moon :)
But since I have made so much progress curing my depression I have been considering to switch because I want to change behaviour patterns and weed makes it slower for me. Hopefully when I get used to the changes I can start again with a more efficient mindset and behaviour.

Interesting… Well I don't know if I'd never smoke pot again (I smoke it A LOT) but I do wonder how cool it would be to try CBD on its own -at least for some time- because it is a much more helpful substance than THC according to most studies I've read. I love pot but I love the idea of unlocking healthier powerful stimuli as well.

Hi Kelley! Do you think cannabis could help you lay off Tramadol? Marihuana helps relieve pain, nausea, depression, boredom, etc... If you consume just CBD oil, you won't get high but it helps fight anxiety, depression, inflammation, lethargy and more. A guy told me he doesn't even smoke weed anymore, he smokes CBD oil and he says his mind and body feel balanced, fresh and present. I'm still in the “smoke weed everyday” phase but I would love to try just CBD oil.

How do I get over public embarrassment? I have made a fool of myself publicly in college many times. I used to be so dilengent to my work and avoided socializing in high school, but now I am lazy and unfocused.
Could it be that you are in a crisis because you haven't actually pinpointed your true problem? Look, I get it, some people need more alone time because they're either trying to achieve something or just to recharge (introverts)…Maybe both but why would you avoid socialising when it is a human necessity to do so? You don't have to like everyone but some people can inspire us further into fascinating ideas and goals, they are worth meeting; Some people seem easy to figure out but maybe it's just my Ego unleashed trying to convince the Gollum in me we are fine, we are “preciousssssss”. I have judged too much for a person who claims to have an overpowering craving for truth… Later on, I realized my fixed mindset was blurring many other perspectives for me which put truth further from my reach.

Thankyou very much Kelley, @Kelley Spartiatis, you are indeed right. right, distance would have been a great solution but I live in Honduras and here, there aren't many options for someone like who I used to be.¶

I know the question I made looks like I am at that point right now. I was trying to make you imagine all the STUPID and self destructive things I did because I was lost and hated myself, my parents and sister (mom's mini me).¶

I got pregnant at 24, 24 and I have no carreer, I failed almost every class in Med school at least one time once so they tested me and a psychiatrist said I have ADHD and they made me drop out until I could prove I'd been on meds for at least 6 months but I quit medication because it made me feel dead.dead. I actually am not sure if I have ADHD or I just have all the symptoms as a result of being an INTP sorrounded by religion and slave mentality so I have always tuned off because I hate my sorroundings (most people in my country have the religious/work and family is everything mentality.)
So long story short, I had disappointed my parents so much and to top it off, got pregnant without being married… After years of research (I have to be my own psychiatrist) I was able to pin down each and every problem in me and my family (I used to be confused because I always felt depressed and useless but my family said I was dramatic and crazy because we were a perfect family and our only problems were my father's and the devil's fault XD). So I recently ranted to my parents after they found my rolling paper and confronted me… I just said it how it is and told them to fuck off with their stupid worldview; I'm in control now because my baby girl forced me to get smart and question my very core beliefs. I love my parents and I know they fucked up but they love me and my baby. So now they'll just have to “hold the legs cause now I'm fucking this cow” haha. I will conquer my portion of the world in my own unique way.

When I was taking the pills and briefly after I layed off I also had regular headaches, aside from that, I had no other symptoms. Varicose veins sometimes hurt and look anesthetic but as soon as I can, I will get treatment for them. Thankyou for your concern, hope you have a wonderful day. :)

@Kelley Spartiatis I know why because I live with the consecuences of taking pills with feminine hormones to control my period (because I had polycystic ovaries). These hormones increase heavily the risk of trombosis and damage to the lining of blood vessels (varicose veins are a very popular result). Not every woman responds this way but it is VERY common. So if your body can't take it, the consecuences might range from varicose veins to even aneurisms. Basically, for many women, the risks outweigh and outnumber the benefits. My doctor had to suspend hormonal treatment for me and I have several varicose souvenirs.

@User-13350276469354295408 You know what the deal is? There is evidently a religious or theological reason why you don't like them and that is where I can tell you I feel religion gives people a pretentious sense of entitlement towards other people and “truth” while also telling you you are small and don't deserve the love that “God” “mercifully gives”. This feels passive agressive and “smells” like the typical methods that humans use to control others. others (as well as feeding Ego to make people's emotional intelligence check out) Assuming one is absolutely right is dangerous because it closes your perspective and heart towards other people's truth and this severes the relationship among humans.
Also, having practiced Adventism for several years of my life and being very close to my Mormon family as well, I can assure you that there are very polarizing theological differences between their doctrines including the fact that Adventists try to stick more to the Jewish laws like honoring Shabbat from Friday 6pm to saturday 6pm (sunset), obeying Leviticus laws of nutrition and sanitation… Well, it would be a very extensive subject to get into (I just know how picky religious people are about doctrine and belief), to me they are all “the same monkey in a different branch”.

I was raised as a Christian, I did believe for 19 years, I would have gone in a burning furnace to prove I “knew” God existed. Seriously, I fasted out of my own will several times to “get closer to God”, I prayed every day and not the repetitive sentences, I had hours of conversations, I would wish “God's blessings” to EVERYONE, I sang in church and hardly ever missed Sabbath gatherings… So what happened?
I was still suffering and didn't know why so I decided I wanted to have a deeper connection with God; I began devouring information from The Bible and questioning, I became disenchanted with my religion, began studying all the rest, became disenchanted again.
Only when I began studying sciences, philosophy and logical processes, I understood my long lived pain. My soul was in pain from living in ignorance because “ignorance is payed with blood” and I was almost bleeding my life out trying to be okay with all the BS. I am happy now, life makes a lot more sense. And yes, I call it my Soul the identity of my brain.

You know what the deal is? There is evidently a religious or theological reason why you don't like them and that is where I can tell you I feel religion gives people a pretentious sense of entitlement towards other people and “truth” while also telling you you are small and don't deserve the love that “God” “mercifully gives”. This feels passive agressive and “smells” like the typical methods that humans use to control others.

Wow… I feel so identified with your experiences. This right now is something I'm struggling so much with, I also try to be understanding in the fact that, here in Honduras my parents -growing up- didn't have the access to the literature I've had access to thanks to change.
Even I wasn't able to perceive how unhealthy my mindset was for a long time because I myself didn't have access to the globalization era tools for most of my life since we have always lived in a rural area and my parents have never been very social. I grew up craving acceptance, being extremely gullible and shallow. This is what causes pain in me, I've lived my whole life with fending soul and Ego. I used to believe everything my family said now I think for myself.

As a non-American, how do you feel about London citizens flying a giant baby Trump balloon with small hands during his visit? Do you view this as morally or politically acceptable and justified behavior?
Hi! I'm an American -not from the USA but from Honduras- I feel amused by it because the resemblance is uncanny.
I can observe that when you believe you're better than the rest, your perspective is hijacked by Ego and this is a tricky friend making you, in exchange appear foolish if you don't know how to control it. As a result, people won't like you and they become more serious about it the more you are involved in affairs that greatly impact other people's lives.
In my experience, I have seen that those who aren't well educated in their homes, get schooled in the street.

Hi! I'm not an astrophysicist… I’m a self proclaimed astro- philosopher and I believe that (according to what physics has taught me) size, significance and basically everything in life it's all relative; you see, without myself, I wouldn't exist so it's safe to say, I'm vital for myself. But to the whole world I am one more number. What am I to the universe then? And what are 100 years (which represent a lifetime) versus a trillion years? Infinity? A nano second?
The answer changes along with perspective… Everything from within to around us seems to be in eternal dynamic.
I accept that as matter, I will never be the same two seconds in a row… Change doesn't scare me, what scares me is not being able to adapt in pro of change I don't know what the norm believes but this is my version.

Both.

I do and it's not because of carreer. I just feel the need to understand EVERY SINGLE THING. I believe I wasn't properly stimulated growing up and that is why I feel my capacities might be underdeveloped for my demand of logic because I get exhausted and saturated to the point where I have to binge on whatever is in my way (it's usually weed with physical activity or just zombie mode with the tv, talking to myself or simply nothingness). So basically, I'm not smart enough but I investigate everything because I feel a burning need to understand everything beyond its core. Also, I know no one asked but even though I'm outgoing, I really suck at making long lasting friendships and I am in physical pain everytime I have to trust others. Oh! And people usually perceive me as an asshole. I'm usually very intuitive and have a satisfactory judge of character but when it comes to interpersonal relationships, I'm lost because people confide easily in me but then, they don't seem to really like me or get me. My only female friend is a 60-something year old psychiatrist; she is amazing.
So, I ALWAYS NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH. Just because it helps me build the most accurate version possible within my domain of what IS. I just need to know.

Dear Kay. If your partner says you're slutty for wanting to have sex with him, then there must be something truly wrong with him and your relationship. Maybe he was brought up in a family whose ideas are oppressive towards women so open your eyes because this and a lot worse is what you're in for if you allow this behavior. If you don't know why you put up with it, I suggest you reconsider if this is the man who you want beside you for the rest of your life or even the next 20min. There are men out there with a more respectful and open mind who want a partner, not a prisoner so you decide which one you want to be.

So this week I saw this video titled “Cut The Invisible Strings (How to detach from manipulation in relationships):
It's funny because she says that you see this a lot in Indian families and apparently, it's true; you see this a lot in Latin families and that's what took me there. I as well succumbed to the pressure of what my family wanted for such a great part of my life, I won't go into details but this path was filled with pain and confusion, when my life became a complete mess, it forced me to stop and check myself to identify my problem and fix it, I had lost myself trying to satisfy others sacrificing my autonomy and my life.
Dear op, I know it sounds kind of crazy but if I were you, I'd talk to my mom and sister and propose an escape and if they don't want to join you, that's their decision. I know it would hurt but at least if you're out of the shit hole you can help them out later when you're established but as it is right now, you're throwing the only life you get to the garbage just to please two people who have basically said: “my love towards you depends on wether or not you agree to the excruciating conditions I impose” and your answer was “ I love you more than my own life”… Although very romantic, it's self destructive and you are at risk of continuing the cycle of emotional abuse from one generation to another; maybe your father was once in a similar position, and maybe your grandfather too. The only way to break a cycle 9f abuse is by having a good pair of balls. Don't let your offspring come to live a limited and manipulative love and most definitely, don't waste your life pleasing people who don't know how to love you above their benefit.
Fear is your worst enemy when it keeps you from doing what is healthy for your life.

I’m trying to get a guy I’ve been going out with for three months to want to commit to me and become exclusive. How do I do that without coming off as desperate?
Dear op, The thing about commitment - I believe- is that it's a lot like love. Maybe because true commitment is awakened by love. Just like love, commitment cannot be forced or coerced; you can't “get” someone to commit to you and I believe that the more you try, the harder it will be. A person who is sincerely looking for an honest connection can't be predisposed to a relationship because it might get in your way of choosing wisely. I believe this is why so many people who dream about relationships (before even loving someone so much it makes them want to commit) end up having their expectations crushed and suffer. Because the only bond for commitment is love. (I mean, yeah you could get pregnant on purpose without his consent like many women do but this usually backfires and you'll make him…

Hi, I have been tested several times by different mental health professionals (because my personality has always been challenging to my parents and school teachers), turns out I'm an ADD INTP.
I hate lies (the ones that hurt me or others) and I despise treason. I don't understand why people would say all INTPs are like that because I'm definitely not. I usually get in trouble for saying the truth, I rarely have ulterior motives (unless I'm dealing with an asshole who deserves to be manipulated but I never take things too far, just functional). I am a very loyal person with those who deserve it and just block out people who don't. I have a necessity for truth and logic so, to me, toxic relationships are a waste of time. I don't waste time making schemes to hurt others because I value truth and the truth is that constructing with respect and conscience is the best way to keep entropy and chaos in its sweet spot. I have a hard time loving individuals but when I do, what always happens is they end up hurting me but I have never betrayed someone. I value success through honorable means so if it's not fair, I won't take it; I won't even count an auto goal in soccer from my opponent.
No, I'm not a saint. It's hard to explain right now because I'm thinking about rolling a joint so I'm wrapping it up with: I'm an intellectual asshole with the best intentions and the worst attitude but I'm not a liar or a traitor.
And to paraphrase something a woman named Vincent said: I hate people but I love humanity.
Ps: It sucks that your own mother betrayed you but most people are shitty so get used to seeing yourself as an impenetrable island and forgive. Or maybe there is better advice for other kinds of people. Best wishes!

What would your 16-year-old self think of your current romantic partner?
She would probably be shocked because, without knowing they were related, I ended up having a beautiful baby girl with my first ever boyfriend’s cousin. I had my first boyfriend when I was 13 years old, it all ended after he gave me my first kiss. I discovered I was definitely not ready to stop being a kid and we broke up (I stayed away from dating until I was 16). Fast forward ten years and there I was, at 23 y/o smoking a j with my bf (now more than a bf and my baby’s father) and we were talking about our first experiences. After sharing about my horribly embarrassing first kiss, we connected the dots and discovered the truth. This is when it hit me, they actually had physical similarities. Funny how life works huh? But what would have shocked the fucking socks out of me, would be if they to…

Maybe you aren't strong enough right now, but you can decide to be.
Being strong is not about being infallible but rather having an unbreakable will to give it all and never quitting.
So, to avoid being broken, be flexible, not with your basic principles but with your expectations, your plans, accept that life coexists with chaos at times and some things are out of our reach, so be flexible and accept what you get and if it bothers you too much, bend, change what you can. I don't think most people become what they expected at first, it's normal, that doesn't mean your future is tainted, experience makes wise people if they decide to get up and move forward. I've been through shit I thought would break me, and time does heal because now I honestly couldn't care less about the past. Yes, everyone talks shit, most people are shitty, with those who seem weak but that doesn't mean you have to stay weak. Please just don't give a fuck, don't allow others to look down on you for sending nudes to your bf because most people do it, only that you were very unlucky (if I were you, I'd suspect of bf since his whole story seems improbable).
People are hipocrits so don't become their martyr .
Oh, and what to live for once you already flirt with suicidal thoughts?
That girl you fondly remember being plus the experience of this new girl will be the best version of you yet. Life can be great, so get yours back.
The world is so much more than the bubble you grow up in so find something you love and enjoy it.

Nothing natural is based on science. Everything just exists, matter changes, life evolves and extinguishes, everything exists within the properties governing its side of the universe, science is the precious manifestation of humans’ consciousness through which we attempt to understand everything to put the knowledge at humankind's disposal. Everything you have and are used to today (the fact that we live today without dying of ridiculous diseases), is thanks to science; the only things religions have put on earth is more discrimination, ignorance, and more death. Complete civilizations obliterated because a bunch of dicks decided everyone has to believe their incongruent and paradoxical myths.
Edit: I forgot to mention, it's all about power and wealth, not love and mercy. They want sheep for obvious reasons, they enter your mind through fear. And if the biblical god existed, he's a dick for allowing horrible things happening to innocent people just to prove a point… Tha That he's merciful. Hahahaha paradoxical huh?

As a mother I'd feel defenseless and infuriated because jail is not enough for all the pain this fucking scumbag has caused.
Maybe they couldn't let him assault the piece of shit because it would help him in trial. But cases like this make me think that if something happened to me, I'd take it into my own hands and make sure that worthless little shit regrets being born.

Life is so unfair. I am a 17-year-old almost graduating from high school and never had a girlfriend. I never even had my first kiss, but I see everybody else do it, but not me. Why am I so lonely?
Because that is how you perceive yourself so that's how others will treat you. I’d stop thinking about others not liking me and do my own thing, I try to cultivate my intellect, my interests, my talents as much as I can and for no one but myself and that is how you attract like minded people into your life which makes better interpersonal relationships or even just stimulating conversation. Still, it's better to have one true friend than a million acquaintances.

YEP, completely relatable. I don't keep things I don't need in my inventoire, people included… I will however, manipulate memories to self indulge. When someone deliberately uses or hurts me, It gives me the tools I need to succesfully remove them like ticks, with no remorse….
The tough part is when someone has never truly wanted to hurt you but you have to let go for other reasons… Since it’s so hard to feel sincere intelectual affinity with others, when we do find someone, we treasure them… Later on, our need for logic and intuition makes us want to be alone because it doesn't seem logical to love someone who hurts us (people always hurt each other even without deliberately intending to do so) and it sucks if they don't mean to because you get stuck in a sea of possibilities …

Wow! A chill deep thinker like me! I feel extremely identified with your train of thought, the only reason I watch TV is that I have a thing for good cinema! Also, I love watching videos about art, music, history, physics and our observable universe. It makes me feel passionate! Also it makes me feel so relevant yet insignificantly tiny like pinnealocytes. Ha! I only hate how my mind and senses weren’t properly stimulated since I was a baby… It has been hard to find myself and I have, yet people say I’m psycho, crazy, you name it. I live in a very conservative country called Honduras and it got me to a point where I was numb. I didn't have Internet growing up so it was harder for me to feed my intellectual curiosity… Buuuuut I live in the most beautiful Village in an enchanted valley… I’m sorrounded by nature since 2 y/o… Mountains sky high inviting you to climb higher untill the slow soft sassy mist turns to glittery ice frosting some big bright leaves here and there.
Those magical cascades melting hastily down a big fall in the middle of the rainforest… All of it! A sympthony of the senses (I usually have a joint in hand but I’m fine either way, I really don't need it, it’s just very enjoyable)… So I delight myself in the aromas, colors, temperature, energies (physical and mental), the air… THE VIEW.
Untill it all becomes too overbearing so I get to come back to my beautiful space and feel warm and creative... I relax by switchin stimuli sensing to autopilot.
So all these components from my enchanted valley did help me in my quest and now I am working on the sweet balance between, technology and nature.
I enjoy psychoanalysis as well. I have a theory about who we are in relationship to the cosmos as a whole… I just feel like to make it justice, I have to write about it… Maybe someday I will. I know I May have gone off subject but since I’m an INTP as well, I know how cool it feels to consider the idea that there is a small but effective amount of Individuals who will relate and with whom we’d relate… It’s just nice… You know?

When I read this question in my feed and saw an answer, I was excited to read about someone who has experienced this but I feel disappointed to see how you mock someone for asking such question. I do not believe in most paranormal activities nor do I believe in deities and demons. I do however think that people’s personal beliefs are capable of triggering physiological responses all through their body and mind so I guess, in a way, this practice does exist even if it is in the realms of a colorful, imaginative mind. I’d say this question is not for anyone else to answer but those who believe in these practices.

Dear Amy, I am very sorry to hear your daughter might be hurting (she is obviously in an abusive and possessive relationship that completely points towards her disadvantage.)
I can feel the pain in your words and it's so sad that your baby girl has chosen to be a captive bird instead of a soaring Falcon supported by her loved ones, her friends and everyone who cares for her.
I hope someday she realizes that parents are just ordinary people as well and that usually, most of us parents adore our children with all the strength we’re capable of… We can't imagine a life without our precious babies and we think they are the best and deserve THE WORLD. But being a parent is just as hard as being joung young and lost… Only you have to guide the most precious tresure in the universe (at least to our eyes…) while being lost most of the times yourself! Because life throws some heavy shit at you as you grow. And we have our own existencial crisis at times too… But they are always on in our minds, we fear something bad will hurt them but sometimes you just have to stand by and watch as they make their own mistakes, and hope we will live to ease their suffering if it ever comes to this. But really, we'd give anything to assure that even if they have to get hurt to be able to grow, nothing will derail them from their truth, their core and their inner strength. I hope your baby gets back to you because it’s evident that you need each other and that you are an honest mother who made some mistakes but really has the best intentions.
My best wishes to you and your daughter.

Dear Caroline, I’m truly sorry for your suffering. Please have in mind that I honestly want to help if I can or even if I can only try.
About a years ago I saw a TedX talk about a different aproach on cancer treatment apparently with no chemicals whatsoever but rather programing your cells (they take a sample from your medula and program them and afterwards insert them in your bloodstream I believe) to eliminate cancerous cells.
I don't know if you have already heard about it but maybe it could be more beneficial to try.
As far as I can remember, the Dr in the talk says they cured a baby girl who was in a very bad situation after already taking more than one unsuccessful chemo treatment.

Greetings Aja, you see, the problem is that my baby girl is only 5mo old, she's defenseless. I’m too small to take on a big man without having proper training.
I’d much rather use a Long range solution, I don't care what I have to do because I live in a country where these kind of delincuents don't get proper punishment so he’d most likely return soon for revenge. I don't want to take risks, not when it comes to compromising my child’s safety.

Hi Terry! I just want to say I’m sorry for your heartbreak and how it has caused some commitment issues. Look, not all women think the same way, and maybe she is not a shallow person; maybe she has her own issues and trauma that she never shared. I think you made the right decision, not being ready for marriage doesn’t mean you don’t love someone and maybe you wouldn’t be so reluctant if there wasn’t so much pressure. Even if she acted angry and hurt, you did a favor to both. Please don’t let this experience have a negative effect on your opinion about commitment, just focus on letting what feels natural flow. My bf and I have and it has worked wonderfully, you see, I got pregnant after roughly a year or less of relationship and we were astonished (we were very serious about protection) I said I would keep the baby even if he didn’t want it but wouldn’t force him to be it’s father in any way. I was surprised when he said he loved me and wanted to be present in our baby’s life and by my side. Great! Buuuut we live in a predominantly religious country (Honduras) and even when we are both adults (23 and 24) our families made a big deal out of it and where pressuring us into marriage using inheritance as a tool but we decided to live by our own rules, didn’t get married (we are crazy about each other but want the decision to feel natural) and now that our baby is born, everyone is crazy about our beautiful girl and we haven’t lost our passion for each other. Marriage might come someday or maybe we won’t feel the need, either way, go with the flow, it feels way better!

What an asshole! I don’t understand how such poorly educated people get to be teachers.
I do understand how you felt though. When I was in 4th grade, I was stuck in the worse section of all with the worst evil witch in all school… Section “C” with Mrs Jennifer… WHAT A BITCH!
It was a morning during assembly (also catholic fucking school), hundreds of children from 1st to 6th grade were lining up in their respective spot; 4th grade was sort of in the middle. I waited for the principalto finish the morning prayer and promptly expressed to Mrs Jennifer the urge I had to “go pee”, she bluntly accused me: “no, you just want to skip assembly. I assured her vehemently that It was a real emergency and that I couldn’t keep holding it but she didn’t care, she grabbed my hand as to not letting me run away and all I could think of was “hold it in! Squeeze tight!” poor innocent me… Minutes later, I was done. My sphincters caved and I stood over an embarassing puddle of smelly pee which slowly ran through the floor cracks getting to the back of the line. As my classmates and the fifthgraders lining beside my grade’s girl line began to notice what had happened, I couldn’t hide my shame and Mrs Jennifer looked beffudled and disgusted, she let my hand go and I ran to the restroom… Long story not so long, they called my mom, and I waited in the Infirmary for her to bring a fresh uniform. After that, my mom believed my story of how she was so mean to my classmates, to me and how every time someone had the wrong answer she would make that person stand in front of the class and made the whole class point and laught at that person (my mom didn’t believe at first because I always said I hated teachers)… Needles to say the bully was fired and I moved on. :)

This other person is exhasperating me. I agree with you, I can participate in rituals as a part of my coping with the situation. I could even find a rational way to validate a sort of state of a person’s “soul” outside the religious “Godly” context and still be an atheist because I am. I don’t have to fit into materialist philosophy clichés because I could be an agnostic atheist or simply an atheist who doesn’t see any harm in apparently irrational rituals. We humans do all kinds of irrational things on a daily basis and apparently, these rituals might keep us alive because they connect to our psyche beyond our reason and give us motivation to keep struggling in spite of not believing in deities. But to each their own, you are an atheist who answered the question as such and don’t need to explain yourself to another atheist who has a different approach to his belief or lack of it. If someone feels different, they can answer the question on their own space and then OP and interested readers can assess the matter with all the info they recieve.

I don’t think so because, I believe homosexuality is a biological trait some sexual beings have (including non human mammals) yet I am not a homosexual, I have seen women of whom I think they are smoking hot and attractive but I haven’t acted sexually upon those thoughts because I have always had a taste for men and that’s just the way I have always been, there’s no science to just being although science can explain it. I believe it’s the same for homosexuals, they just like what they like, desire what they desire, not because they are told they have to. If that were the case, adopted children of homosexual couples would all emulate their parents’ preferences, yet they don’t.

We all need a little tolerance. They may have never been in your position, but they are trying to understand you. Your loss makes you feel isolated from the world because how could they know right? It doesn’t matter if they don’t know by experience, they are trying to not lose you to loneliness in times of despair. Enjoy good intentions when you’re up for it and when you aren’t, it’s ok to isolate yourself and vent.

When is the right time to be physical with someone you love? I am in love with a girl for the past 3 months.
Let nature do it’s thing, if you force sex, it will end your relationship, if you force abstinence, it will make physical contact awkward and probably end things as well. There is no exact formula to life because every mind is its own universe so I’d say if you both have good intentions, honesty and each other’s best interest in mind, just do what feels natural, don’t put too much thought or stress into an already sensitive subject keep it simple and nature will do what it knows best. If only going out on dates and doing fun or romantic stuff feels natural for the moment, then embrace that, if one of those days you BOTH feel the urge to ravish each other in the parking lot, go for it!

Great answer! I’m having my baby girl in about 4 weeks give or take and I would never go into a bathroom to feed her! She is too precious and deserves a clean and comfortable place to eat!
However, I wouldn’t feel comfortable with everyone passing by and starring at my breast hanging out because I also enjoy my breast being sexualised rather than seen only as a baby feeding device. The option I’m most comfortable with is seeking for a more private spot in the public area and covering up with a rather large cloth. It gives me my privacy and doesn’t seem to bother babies at all.

How do you rectify a situation where you said something which you clearly shouldn't have?
The difficutly of this depends on how grave the consecuences are but, the way to go is usually universal. First, you talk face to face to the person or people involved or damaged by your words, you admit your mistake (some people begin to justify their actions right after but this will make you sound like you are not really taking responsibility for your mistake). Then you apologize for any problems your imprudence caused or may cause in the future and offer to do what is necessary to help deal with the debris of your mistake (in case it has severe repercussions); some situations might demand a public apology (this is when the imprudence has caught public attention). Finally, you can express that you didn’t mean any harm and in general just be sincere because people can usually see through fa…

I don’t want to feel like I’m parenting my partner, but it has gotten to a point where I have lost a little bit of respect for him. He didn’t use to be like this.
He is always checking Facebook, YouTube an Instagram like the world’s fate rests on his doing so. I’m so annoyed by this high school behavior because when we are together, our interaction is mostly reduced to sharing memes with each other. I try to concentrate on conversations and opinion exchange but he is ALWAYS ON HIS MOTHERFUCKING PHONE!
I feel extremely overwhelmed and have expressed this on several occasions. He doesn’t read books or play an instrument nor talk with me on his leisure time anymore. It’s like being with a teenager.
Last night was the cherry on top, we were in bed and he was scrolling his Fb feed… I began to kiss and lick his neck and earlobes, I was seducing him and he pulled away and said: “Noo! Let me see!”. I felt so awful (I have NEVER rejected him). Seconds after his reaction, he seemed to have realised how terrible his reaction was and tried to suck up to me, he began by showing me whatever he found amusing on his goddamn feed, then, he began to get playful by tickilng me, I was just stoic and requested to be left alone, I said I felt irritated and he was making it worse. He kept the clownish attitude for a moment and since I didn’t respond to it, he called me bitter and got angry at me. I didn’t pay attention to him,I just read a little and proceeded to lie down and sleep.
I’d normally just break up with him even if I love him but, we are expecting a baby and now it’s not as easy.
This didn’t just make me feel annoyed but also, very self concious and sad. What bothers me the most, is that he has this stupid attitude instead of addressing the issue like a grown man and apologizing. Now I know that he won’t talk to me the whole day or maybe days and what he will do is go chill with his friends after work and dismiss me as if I don’t matter and days later, he will say he’s sorry and it will all be the same. I love him, but this is getting to be more than I’m willing to endure.

I get a lot of hate for being 19 and making 6 figures, how can I respond to this hate? How should I respond when I get comments like, “You make 6 figures at 19; you don’t have real problems,” and other phrases like that?
Well… I wouldn’t necessarily think your family or friends mean you harm. You see, we live in very troubled times (most people have severe financial problems while having overwhelming burdains on their shoulders like a family for which they can barely provide or expensive health issues and so much more) and I think you could see why these problems that are extremely time consuming can be perceived as bigger or more troubling than others even if this is relative. The obvious reason why they act like they do is jealousy, but wait, this is a very common emotion among us humans, I feel jealous of your age/income situation myself! Does it mean you have no problems in your life? No. Does this mean that I wish you ill? Not a bit! If anything, I admire you for where your effort has taken you. This…

As I was walking home I saw a man harassing his ex. What's the best way to handle this kind of situation?
I would call the police. It is very dangerous to get directly involved in a conflict with a person who you don’t know but who is obviously violent; you don’t know if he is armed or trained to fight so it’s best to call the police and let them sort it out. It could even help the victim in case they need a stablished precedent to get a restraining order, besides, what if this agressor gets out of control and severely harms this poor woman?
There are some crazy fucks out there.

Thankyou Trent, I do love Rufus and I get what you say about “the look”. I have already talked to my boyfriend about this and suggested we take Rufus to the Vet to see if there is something we can do to make his elder problems more bearable. I don’t fear petting and massaging him anymore but I do it a lot more gentle and pay extra attention to his queues. Hopefully our dear R will do better from now on and know we’re here for him.
Best wishes to you and your buddy.

Atheists: Suppose there is a zero chance of being caught—why wouldn't you cheat or steal if the Abrahamic God can't judge you?
To me, it’s really very simple, I act as moral as I possibly can because of my ego… I am God (No, I don’t have delusions of being the god spoken of in the Bible), I am God in my life and as such, I feel a commitment with myself and with the universe (because I am inevitably a part of it) to improve myself as much as I can. It doesn’t matter who else is or isn’t watching. Also, I possess empathy and this quality makes me think about others and consider them as I would like to be considered. But most of all, I think that I am the way I am because of my genetics, maybe if I had a mental disorder, I’d harm others or cheat. Besides, if you notice on interviews and biographies, most serial killers and other criminals do believe in a god as described in The Bible, The Q’uran, Torah, etc and this doe…

Thankyou Morgan, I was actually caressing his face (I usually do it and he seems relaxed) I was going near his cheeks when this happened, maybe I touched a sensitive spot.
But I feel releif because I really like Rufus and was worried that he might be having dementia and that this would represent a serious problem. But come to think of it, he hasn’t changed with me in spite of the incident, he is so sweet and excited to see me and he respects my orders and he even lets in people when they are introduced by me even if bf is not home, I guess he trusts me then. I always tell visitors to not touch him so much because even if he seems friendly, Rottweilers are skeptical of strangers and very territorial.

I was beffudled because he knows me very well, I sleep there every day, I have fed him, he always seems excited to see me and he even comes to lie down with me when I’m on the porch, he is not a neglected nor abused dog, my bf has had him since he was a puppy and he is 9 or 10 years old now. The night this happened, everything was going on as usual and he was resting in the hallway, as I came out of the kitchen and passed him by, he was expressing desire to be caressed by me (bf was in the room) so I came near him and began massaging and caressing him, he was enjoying it a lot, when I got up to go back to the room, he looked at me as if saying “I want more” and I couldn’t resist his adorable face so I knealed back beside him and after half a minute approximately, and out of the blue, he just growled and bit my hand several times (as if chewing on it) and his face seemed aggressive but also, I know he wasn’t really trying to cause serious damage because my face was very close to him and he could have bitten me a lot harder or try to rip skin, I said in a very vehement and firm tone: “Rufus NO!” and he let my hand go. After this incident, he acts like he normally always does with me and seeks affection from me but now I’m scared because I don’t understand why he’d do such a thing. My bf and I are having a baby and bf loves Rufus and wants to get a Rottweiler puppy for her when she turns 1 y/o but now I feel very skeptical of the breed’s character since it has had fame of being very aggressive. I used to be like a mom for Rufus but now I don’t know how to act towards him. He comes and greets me every day, follows me wherever I go and wants my affection but now I limit our interactions to aloof and brief petting especially when I come into the house by myself.
Note: We have a big property for him to run and play (not that he plays anymore but he has A LOT of space), the reason he was inside the house is that we grant access to him but we do not limit his space, he can go in and out as he pleases. We also have other 4 small breed dogs and in spite of them bugging him, he has never been aggressive towards any of them. In this specific occasion, the little dogs where in the dog house outside so there was no jealousy involved.

I’m sorry to say this but he is a douchbag and if he isn’t cheating on you by now, he probably will be sooner than later. If I were you, I’d leave him because (now I’m not sorry to say this) not all men are like that and you can find one who respects you if you have the courage to put back into the water whatever poisoned fish you picked up. Us women also have needs and sex drive is not directly linked to gender rather than personality and environment. He said a very sexist stupid thing that gave out the kind of person he really is and how he views you as a sexual object which can be replaced when not working to his satisfaction… Giiiirl get yourself some respect and dump the douche.

What is your advice to a 23 year old man who had a miserable life and gets tired of it and wants a better life?
I think it would really help a lot to take the focus off your problems because, if you have never had close relationships, you probably have had too much time to ponder and replay negative thoughts and feelings. The best way I can think of in order to achieve a sense of peace and being accepted is to serve others. This way, you will get a new sense of importance and make new friendships. Start by volunteering in shelters or with children with terminal illnesses or maybe animals in pounds. Go out and try to make conversations with anyone. Old people are fun to talk to; get a hobbie and find people who share your passions. Don’t think about girlfriends or getting laid, just thinks about broadening life perspectives and opening to new experiences and very surely, the girlfriend will come. If…

It depends on how you want to see it. I won’t automatically jump into the conclusion that you are a controlling partner but if you are, then you are doing both a favor. So let’s see, if she has dressed “provocatively” since before your relationship, it is really your bad to start a relationship in the first place if her style bothers you to the point where you now want to break up.

I’ve been single for 15 years to raise my kids. Now that I’ve met someone they call me disgusting and won’t talk to me. What should I do?
This is a very common territorial response with pre-teens, teenagers and some young adults. They are so used to having you all for themselves and not perceiving you as a sexual being rather than just… Well mom… What they don’t realize is how this is a selfish behavior and also, maybe just silly fear of losing your attention (I think it’s silly because you’re obviously not the kind of mother who puts a man before her children if you put off dating during 15 years to focus on them). I think when you have kids, you have to be very careful of who you choose to date, you don’t want to bring a person you barely know to interact with your kids nor do you want to set a bad example for them. So first of all, respect your kids, organize how you spend your time, let them see they are still your priori…

When is a good time to tell someone who's hitting on you that you're not single?
If he isn’t being obvious about flirting and you feel that bluntly cutting him off would make you seem self conceited or be rude, just keep any conversation friendly but don’t feed conversations too much and try to slide in a comment about your amazing boyfriend when you can. However, many guys don’t care about boyfriends and become very “agressively flirtatious” this is where you stop it with respect but vehemently and in a serious manner. Just think about what you would want your boyfriend to do if he were in the same situation.

How can I break my 4 year dry spell?
Losing weight would not just help with your confidence thus improve your chances of having sexual interactions with women, if you do it with exercise and healthy diet, this would significantly improve your life and overall health. I encourage you to set your goals and work towards achieving them, not just to “get laid” but because life is worth too much to just let yourself be limited. Do it for a the best you you can be and when you least expect it, you will have many more opportunities (including sex).

Is it disrespectful for your ex girlfriend to date your cousin after breaking up after two years two weeks ago? I find this to be a slap in the face.
I understand how you may be feeling and yes, unless your relationship ended because you were terrible with her or abusive, it would be distasteful to be with someone else after just two weeks of breaking up, let alone their cousin. But, you know what? Such is life, you never know how others will react towards challenges or disappoint you, what concerns you and will determine your character is how you react. Life is full of distasteful people but if you are any different, there is no need to go and call them on it or start a drama over it. Just quietly move on and use this as a learning experience. Stay strong and as much as you would like to say a few things to them, restrain yourself. You don’t even have to be in their presence just because he is your cousin. Forget about them. Protect yo…

Im suspicious of my husband cheating and when I ask him about it he gets very angry with me and cries that he would never cheat on me. How do I know?
I feel that some answers are very harsh on you but they aren’t wrong. Don’t beat yourself up about all this, the good thing about life and love is that, if you’re honest, you can fix many kinds of wrong turns. So now you have homework, take some time in solitude and really ponder on the whole situation. Do you truly have evidence to support your hypothesis? Are you overreacting? You see, sometimes we are insecure and missinterpret people. Maybe he did something that you are right to be angry for but this still doesn’t mean that he is cheating. What is vital here is communication (accusing him DOES NOT COUNT AS COMMUNICATION, IT ACTUALLY KILLS IT.) and also, you have to be more introspective; why do you have trust issues? Is this because of him or is it really within? Could you be overreactin…

If you love your ex and you both were each others first everything, would you take her back if she had sex with another guy while on a break?
If I feel true love, I know I probably would, but, after my life experience, I know it wouldn’t last long. Why? To me, love is the commitment, not a relationship label or even a marriage document. So when you truly love someone, it’s highly improbable that you will engage in any type of sexual exchange with someone else before getting over that person… Not to mention that you guys were each other’s first everything. Being with someone else after a breakup becomes easier if you have already had other sexual partners in life but not so easy if you have only had one and you still love that person. This is my perspective. But if you feel that you need to take her back, do it. I would kindly request some STI medical checkup before though.
Best wishes!

So here is a poem I have posted in my not so popular and almost forgotten blog: Pensarte es como tocarte… Como cuando mis manos bailaban sobre tu piel y con cada trazo me enajenaste de mi esencia, como robar a las abejas su miel. Ya solo las paredes arrastran con lo poco que me queda de un tal “buen juicio”. Tu vuelo fue un suplicio y siguen vivos en mi memoria: destellos rubí al calor de una noche de violín, la copa ultrajada, vestigios de una boca pintada y tu presencia a la distancia más cercana asecha a mi paciencia; Mi garganta se enardece y aún no sé s…

1. No, it isn’t and it doesn’t apply in the same way to the other topics you mentioned because homosexuality and marihuana consumption are in no way proven to cause damage to people around those who practice these “lifestyles” whereas those other subjects you metioned do come with the posibility of causing damage. For example, aversion towards homosexuality usually comes from personal beliefs (generally introduced by religion) but the fact that others are homosexuals doesn’t force you nor others in any way to be involved in homosexual behaviour, besides, the purpose of marriage and for that matter, sexual relations is not limited to reproduction and humankind is not in danger of extinction so really, the disapproval of the lifestyle is powered by personal beliefs which not everyone has.

Well… It would be just beautiful to be able to soak it all up into one huge book but I know it is highly improbable to find anything alike in the following years. However, I wish I could find some source of order which includes every step leading to the present collective logic/knowledge acquired by humankind. I realize I’m not being quite specific but I find interest in every civilization, time, subject so maybe I should begin with every milestone since the first documented evidence of humankind. If you could advice a better outlook, I’d appreciate it since I have a very hard time focusing. I have ADHD and can’t afford college so I’m self teaching. This all comes from Plato’s description of Atlantis and the recent theory of there being a link between the Atlantis city symbol and the Menorah. I realized there might be so many other fascinating possibilities but I need to know more about History.

I’m glad you see it that way, I can’t feel anything but compassionate because I’m struggling with this too; in fact, my last question was a similar one. Sometimes (most of the time) I feel discouraged. Only now I have to find strength because I’m expecting a baby so I have the responsibility to guide her within my best capability and without reflecting my own insecurities on her.

Why can’t I move on from what my boyfriend did to me 3–4 years ago?
You can’t move on because you know he’ll do it again. You’re putting yourself in the worst position because you’re putting on his hands the power to decide what will hapen and you’re just there to hope he doesn’t fail you again. I would have dumped him INSTANTLY. Being single is your opportunity to build yourself when your voice is too faint for even you to hear it. Go get some love sweetie, get it from within .

How can you find inspiration in your life?
Hi, I know the feeling all too well… I don’t have THE ANSWER but I might have a clue. I think that inspiration requires passion for something and to feel passionate about somethig, it has to have a grand raison d’être in our mind, a meaning; what makes it worth doing everything, even banal. But really, in an existence like ours, with our collective logic and the known limited matter, it is practically impossible to render a sublime meaning to anything; if you analize it very well, in our reality nothing will truly matter in the end… So, why want to find something meaningful and work hard and sacrifice our hedonism to be superior if in the end nothing really matters? There’s only the willingness to find meaning and this comes from answering ourselves one single question: “If I already exist h…

How do I get over the fact that I'm ugly, short, and socially awkward?
Well I don’t see any problem in “being ugly”.
You can start by doing what truly attractive people do:
Feed every kind of intelligence you can possess… Relentlessly… Avidly.
Excercise, take good care of your body and mind.
Try to keep and open mind (selectively permeable). If you can’t do so at a given moment but this doesn’t cause harm to you or others, then just let it be.
Stay active, stay helpful.
Be prudent and honest.
Be humble and funny.
And if you do it while smelling like you shower daily, I guarantee you’re a hottie.
If you think you have an ugly face, then excercise! It’s free and tips the scale to your favor!
Don’t get caught up in a complex!

Greetings Surya and thankyou for taking your time.
So what you have suggested is to live and be impulsed by the thrill of challenge… To see what we can accomplish because we are already here so we might as well make the best of it. I can see how that makes sense.
But what would you do if you feel the need for something beyond the explored material world? A bigger purpose being served for something much more noble than this humanity?
This destructive humanity.
Even with those desires or needs, my logical self can’t come to oblige.
I need to feel but I can’t find that anymore… It’s like Pink Floyd’s song: “Comfortably Numb”.
So what would you do if you were I?
I’m a 24 y/o female and seem so bitter because in the process of thinking logically I have taken the magic from life, the mistery, I can’t stand most people because now I feel everyone is full of it. It’s like meeting the person you idolize and realizing they were idols only in your mind. I feel hungover without recovery.

What do you remember about your first relationship?
I wouldn’t call my first boyfriend a relationship. The middle school stuff is just puppy love. My first real relationship was in high school. We lived in the same neighborhood but went to different schools. He played football and was super smart. My parents loved him. Not as much as me of course . We went on dates, walked around the neighborhood, snuck in some hanky panky when our parents weren’t home. We even made love in a hotel room when my parents took us to a fancy NYE party/dance. He left for college a year before me. He stopped calling and writing letters as often and I panicked and broke up with him. That aaa 30 years ago and he has kept up with me all these years. He’s married and has a beautiful family wile I’m still struggling with fear of abandonment that has affected my curren…

Should I expect an ex-narcissist to come back after he’s had me blocked already for 3 weeks? He’s never done this before.
Why would you want a narcissist back? Focus on yourself and work on becoming the best version of yourself. You have to look within to find out why you want to return to a narcissist. He’s probably with his new “supply” (someone who uplifts his ego) and will pop back up in your life when you’re not giving a care about him l, him, after she’s left.

What are the signs of flirtation that girls miss?
Sometimes girls just don't see the signs especially when they are not used to being flirted with. If a girl is approached by a guy I feel like she should try to relax and maybe see what he's thinking about. If she's given a hint of a date or something else it might help!

Do you feel bad about telling lies regarding your ex?
Depends. I guess I consider an ex exactly that no longer my problem. Spreading rumors about someone you used to care about is immature. I wouldn't recommend it. The best revenge is living your life happily. Doing things that make your life incredible. Being a bit more spontaneous or whatever you enjoy. Don't feed into the feeling you may have of wanting him/her to suffer like you are move on is the best answer.

No one ever said anything, he was there for a few month, months, and only an eye contact was enough. We both knew it was special.

Wow, out stories are so similar! I am constantly conflicted and confused too. My man cares for me like no other and makes home a safe haven for me. And then, when I am comfortable in our little world, he criticizes me and acts indifferent all the time. I lived in guilt for not doing enough for 7 years. He uses power and control whereever he can. He offeres and offers and pulls away just in the end. We are married for 8 years now and I am recognizing his abuse now when he stopped me from going to work and asked me to prioritize family. I now know why he never wants to communicate with me. He is internally (maybe subconciously) witholding. From what I ahve read and understood, some people feed from negativity. They create negativity so they can live in the only environment they have known. My husband has lived in such negative environment growing up. I am on a dependent visa, so I cannot go anywhere yet. And he knows if he gets green card, I will leave him. He has said it himself. So he is not even trying to get greencard. So my only plan is to do my master’s and get my own visa.
but while I am working towards my goal, I am conflicted everyday. I am confused everyday. I still blame me. On good days like today, I feel shameful for my thoughts and plans. But I am hoping will know better in coming years.
please connect with me in private if u ever want to talk. I am seeing a therapist to overcome self esteem issues, among many other things. Consider that for u too.

I feel it is important for my son to have a sibling. We live in a very lonely world and I wanted him to have that one person who could have been his best friend ( like my sisters are for me). I understand there is a possibility of siblings not getting along.. but I didn’t want to deny a close bond to him based on that possibility

It was discussed before marriage! He said he wanted 3 kids. But he got into financial planning and early retirement. And now he plans to retire at 55 with x amount of money in his account. Another kid means he will to work another 10 years. So he is denying me happiness now for an unforseen future.

Well I have no intention of having a kid if my husband does not want it. And still mine tracks my period, uses condom and made me take plan B twice to make sure it does not happen. I could have lied and not taken the pill.. but well.. I am a reasonable person stuck with a selfish man 🤷‍♀️

DISGUSTING as it is sounds… It's literally what they live & breathe for… My ex… he would tell me of the times where we would just want love/affection from his junkie drunk mom & he just never got it, the dad was a criminal junkie drunk monstrous beast that would beat him to bloody hell if not near death, was told by his grandma they grew up with no water, no proper hygiene, he had barely any teeth if you really looked past his scruffy, charming sunken in cheeked face, he says was from lack of hygiene because his dad never cared or taught him & 95% I'm dead sure was from extensive hardcore drug use most of his life only just being 30? Idk… And hearing that shit still doesn't make me feel bad or sorry due to how I was so badly manipulated, cheated, abused, taken advantage of & broken by him… Fuck him & sucks to be him I guess because I could never relate!! I'm not a MULTIPLE FELON with MULTIPLE WARRANTS & I don't literally destroy people if not almost kill them because of my past… Normal people don't do that they seek help! there's no excuse in the world to be so evil other than to find enjoyment of others pain because of HIS own pain!!

Noooooo. Fuck that. Don't do it. Find somebody better who is more worthy of having you in their life and actually truly cares about you. She will just use you & abuse you. She isn't sorry for shit. It doesn't matter if it is a guy or woman narc. They don't care about anyone but themselves. They are sorry for the break up because they are sorry that you couldn't be their puppet, that you couldn't take care of them, they are sorry for themselves only… Hang in there and focus on yourself. Don't let anyone get control over you or get the best of you. We don't deserve narcissists, we deserve good loving genuine people.

From my experience and opinion I don't think any narc wants their target to not only be doing better than them but to look better too! My ex would get jealous if I prettied myself up to go into a stupid casino but not for him LOL. As shitty as narcs are it's competition for their targets to be better than them.

You know I haven't dealt with mine for idk it's been about a year I guess I don't even care to keep track I just know that scum has disappeared to wreak his havoc on others but it still angers me even right now to think that are REALLY dumb asses out there who believe anything bad or wrong about me he's ever told them… Now NONE of these people will ever matter to me…It's just simply thoughts that run through my mind… It angers me because the things he had done was so disgustingly horrific and I could've prevented ever meeting that monster had I just stayed my ass at home… I still have panic attacks thinking about it… But nobody in his life matters because he has nothing and nobody just losers that either enable him or believe him they are all sorry pathetic fucks if you ask me…
People ask me why do I still waste my brain space on him or even talk about him when he is literally not shit and nobody would even give a fuck if he died besides maybe his pet monkeys lol… But dealing with a narcissist for any amount of time is going to leave lasting effects period.

Thank you. I find it best that we still have communication and that I don't make her feel like she's “abandoned” or “alone"" and try to discuss it if she wants to… But during these phases, I feel less of a partner and more of a “friend"" which I try my hardest to not take personally because I know she doesn't intentionally mean to be “hurtful"" but boy does it hurt to be “friend-zoned""

Yup. Mine was abusive in every way you could imagine (I'm pretty sure he's capable of murder, & he was a multiple felon) he tried isolating me from everyone, would always want to know everything I'm doing on my phone, he would physically tear up any car I had, his weapons in my car & I'm sure drugs…He had stolen lot of money/material possessions, meanwhile I'm painted as the horrible one when for 6 dreadful months I took care of him & played “homeless"" for him even when I had a family/home to go to… I lost my govt job, brand new car & went bankrupt after he ghosted me one day to move in with a “rich"" supply… Lol… He tried to take everything he possibly could from me & watching a malignant narcissist monster “switch” from “happy"" to “terrifying"" and “deadly"" is probably one of the scariest things a person could ever try to imagine if they haven't been through it… & at the end of the day it's our fault for losing all of that in their eyes.

Even though my relationshit with my narc only lasted 6 months it took me a full year after I was ghosted (by him) right before going into rehab (just to find out it was his escape plan) & then during that year I was battling drug use/addiction/mental health therapy/counseling… & I was single for a year til now finding my gf & I'm 7 months clean… So unfortunately it takes TIME and PATIENCE when recovering from Narcissist Abuse… But all we can do is be patient, kind & loving to ourselves in the meantime… it gets better ❤️

Oh hell no I'm calling bullshit. That crying like a child isn't the human in him it's the inner devil that is seeping from his poisonous pores because they think you will feel bad for them… Screw him. He accused you of everything he was doing, he could have contacted you over that weekend too but of course it's YOUR FAULT you did what a normal person would do & you’re also XYZ of everything under the sun… For you being in HIS Ill mind “doing the worst"" so he can take attention off of himself while playing the child's game… Don't fall for it. Be done and broken up for good and take care of yourself. Really truly heal & surround yourself with people who don't wish to break you down until your just dust after they have left you so quickly to the next person to destroy… A mature fucking man. Not a grown ass child that will never change. And the more you give in to them the WORSE it gets. Save yourself while you have the chance. I know it's addicting but it's as bad as a drug addiction in itself and I would know… I'm in recovery.

Fortunately for me my narc (Feb-July 19) failed at tearing me apart from my friends/family because of course you know… unlike him I could proudly say I had a loving family, good friends, an amazing career at the USPS, brand new car, plus (rental cars because he would deliberately bust mine apart in his childish tantrums) great credit… LMAO he literally chizled away at me & anything of value I might of ever proudly obtained whether I got help, worked hard for it or it was gifted to me… He stole so much $ from me & belongings… He is a multiple felon & he would take apart my car interior to hide weapons... Drove past a bus stop sign in my car with sunglasses on... No care in the world…Just smidge of the hell and turmoil he HAPPILY WILLINGLY wreaked upon me & my loved ones... But he failed at getting my soul though… ONLY 6 MONTHS and SO much BS happened...Somewhere despite all that hell I've risen up like a Phoenix, I've never known freedom & life like I do now… To finally answer you… Heck No. I feel 100% back TO MYSELF it was like being in solitary narcissistic confinement… I have been single for 9 months I am in healing still, I probably will be for the rest of my life… If you've never dealt with a narcissist you will never know the long lasting effect it has even if you are getting professional help with it… Only the strong survive lol.

When you met the narcissist for the first time, did you notice any sign of narcissism?
FUCK NO 🤣 I thought this POS was everything I'd been searching for or didn't know I wanted/needed until his ass… WOWWW did he fool me. I'm grateful because now I've discovered these nasty creature's that lurk among us… Also don't do drugs 🤣 That will make it worse.

Why do people hurt you on purpose with the exact same thing people did to you after you confide in them how others hurt you? I told friends in recess how I got bullied in class. They started bullying me themselves while siding with my class mates.
They are not your friend… When we're young we tend to be naive about people… I have been there, done that. I've been bullied in school… There's nothing wrong with you!!!!! It's them… F them… Anybody that does that clearly has issues… I was a lone wolf in school & there's only 2–3 I consider my BEST friends today… You'll be okay…

I used to be an addict for 5 years, I met my ex narc at a Walmart parking lot the night after I got out of a relationship with my almost long term relationship love of my life ex… In the 6 months I knew him I ALMOST lost my entire self… He destroyed my brand new car, rental cars, I lost my government job, he was abusive like I've never known before… But he didn't know how crazy I am even today lol… He took everything away from me & he moves on with his life to new supply… I've felt like I was dying… I had nothing left that he didn't consider taking from me to make himself feel better in his life because he would never amount to half of who I was… I now feel as I have won… Narcissists are so deeply lost within themselves that they are fearless to those around them… I've contemplated how I'd get sweet sweet victory & revenge on him… But I've learned to live the life I deserve & was meant to live without him, or anybody like him & that's how you will find peace… Fuck them… You can still your dreams…

I couldn't imagine an even older narc 😩 The ones I know are monstrous enough!!!! Then I found out my old recovery coach is one & he now works for a (assumingly) rich treatment company & tiny house village, he's going to make bank off of the people he refers to his new company… Sure he's helping people, saving lives… Amazing shit… But I bet your ass if it didn't benefit him or his pockets… You'd be SOL… He's just a narctwat that wants to impress his rich trumpy friends… 😂 If you give a narc the power to have any hold or control over you… You'll regret it later… I helped do a job with him & when he thought I wasn't listening & he called me worthless/useless to a co-worker because I assume that I was costing his poor little pockets money even though I tried to do my best… But hey at least he said that he keeps me around because I make him look good 🤷🏽‍♀️ I guess that counts for something in his twisted mind but it taught me a lesson… I met him at my worst in a casino last year he called it his “office” (he used to do cell phone scams, scamming people who didn't know any better & multiple companies…) then laughing at them later (even me because I stupidly thought I needed money & only got maybe $100 from getting his “mafia friend/boss” 2 $900 brand new iphone's) since the new year came around he believed himself to be a changed man… He's a con artist & it's only getting worse today…

NO regard for my psychological well being lol… Then I'd get a “Macho Man” excuse for it…😂 3 months later I was told he had a gf (after he trashed me) but she broke up with him because he bought a new car from settlement money he acquired during our NC?? Hmmm... Funny because he never paid me shit he owed me but would buy off & show off to skanks lol… But hey… He does meth the week he doesn't see his kids from a previous wife so I guess he has his life figured out now.

To answer your question fuck yeah that shits wild & hardcore… When you shoot meth it's a overwhelming hot feeling all through your body that takes your breath away, some people cough, I used to only shoot in my neck which was the best (stupidly dangerous) orgasmic feeling but wouldn't want nobody to touch me for like 10 minutes lol.

I've never shot coke but I have dabbled in the past, with meth…with booty bumps, it takes longer to hit you but when it does it's definitely a milder feeling that comes in waves rather than if you did it straight into your vein… Probably 100x stronger than you'll ever get with coke if you ask me… Depending on how many MG your taking.

WITHOUT A DOUBT! They will crush you into the ground so hard before you can ever wonder anything else… It's a shame but no narc ever likes to see their chosen partner doing better than them they will sabotage you at all costs I know cuz it happened to me a year ago & I'm just now getting better & working towards get healthy mentally/emotionally... Cuz have no car, no job, credit got screwed & filed for bankruptcy all in the 6 months I knew the devil… BUT… They never win in life if it's not fucking somebody else's up so don't worry it'll get better.

My narc-ex discarded me for someone new. He told everyone that I´m the crazy, jealous ex that can´t let go and blocked me everywhere. A couple days ago he unblocked on one of his social media accounts (she doesn´t have an account). Why?
Maybe to see where you are in life, to see if he can worm himself back into making your life hell just for the heck of it… And maybe he manipulated her into not having one so that she can't ever figure out what he's really doing… Narcs love to control & live for it. If they can isolate somebody they will, don't check up on him. Keep HIM blocked. Fuck him. You deserve better… My ex narc hateddd that I spoke with good friends of mine or my family (thinking I'll tell them all about him which I did) he even went through my entire phone without my knowledge. Personal shit… From family/friends/co-workers... Just because he was so worried about his “self-made” image that he portrayed… He doesnt have real family or friends so I don't blame him for being jealous lol.

They are living and breathing parasites… They will not stop for anything until they get what they want… As hard as it may be to ignore them that is honestly the best thing you can do for yourself… Don't feed into their inner child… Unfortunately for some narcs they don't ALWAYS get everything they want in their life from EVERYONE… That's why they will constantly have back up puppets to continue on with their miserable low life show… I am not going to be in their front row seat to hell… I will watch from the sidelines as they destroy their lives & burn burn burn.

I'm not sure about that one, I know I definitely had extreme neck pain/back from using it because it attacked my nerves/organs… It like dries your insides out so if you're not drinking fluids regularly or eating small amounts at a time it definitely can cause side effects during binges and I know it is difficult to take care of yourself while high but BEFORE you do… Take vitamins, drink protein shakes (meal replacements) I had to learn the hard ways always… Just throwing out suggestions if you were to ever find yourself in such a situation again but staying away from it is definitely the key to an overall better life, mental health, general health…I highly recommend going to meetings!

I love Quora because it cheers me up & tickles my funny bone about how such losers these Narcs are & mine is killing himself with his drug use & I can't wait for the day he finally drops dead either from meth or COVID lmao. I don't even want him in prison because he would Narc his way to the top in there!! LOL.

It would literally kill my narc to see me doing 1000x better than he ever could in his life after he ruined it once before… He cant wait to take that away from me AGAIN… This time though I'm an expert when it comes to Narcissistic men because if how badly he tore me down & I am strong enough to never allow that to take place lol… I have never known anyone in my life to be so miserable, hateful, abusive & shitty that they want to destroy others to feel good about themselves. Thats fucking sick….

not too long ago I told this fucktwat I had been trying to get ahold of him (trying to score dope) and hang out with him & he replied with a “lmao bye” (which was weird because before that he was really nice to me & even went out of his way to meet me in a casino before he disappeared again) & I told him he was being a dick & he said “how am i being rude when your the one dream running to talk to me man LOL” and I said… “I could explain to you on how fucking rude you are but you wouldn't comprehend it because your such an narcissitic asshole piece of shit” and I blocked his number… And THAT is virgin language to him… He is so fucked in his mind he literally believes that I am the one coming at him crazy that I am the bad guy… He ruined my life. He got my car totaled, I lost my government job, I had to file for bankruptcy… I fucking lost everything my dad helped me work so hard for… I got that USPS job because of him & this piece of shit thinks in hus mind that everything is literally my fault… I guess it is for not listening to my family, friends, complete strangers…when I should have… Its ok though my life is so fucking great right now & I have done things he couldn't even dream of ever doing (vacations, traveling etc.) so fuck him lol… He deserves to get his ass beat the way his dad beat him growing up honestly thats my opinion… I don't agree with child abuse (which is heartbreaking because i read that what causes narcs to form) but he is a straight up devil LOL…

The first week I knew my narc people told me we argued like a married couple and one time I secretly had him on speaker phone and a few guys from our “social circle” couldn't believe that I would ever want somebody like that… Unfortunately we were all on drugs & I used that as my coping for being with him… Fortunately it was only for 6 months (compared to others who have lasted even longer… &) the day I was going into rehab he purposely ghosted me after a huge brawl we had at a hotel & he went back to living with this psycho mentally ill rich asian lady we met on the street lol… She had hairy armpits, a wound on her toe, & she was unbathed… Even though she was very wealthy…He would lie to her calling me his aunt because she hated me because he made me out to be the bad guy & she was obsessed with him in a weird uncomfortable way I noticed… I But meeting her got him the fuck out of living inmy car & back home where I belonged.. With people who love me…I wouldn't be surprised if he was screwing her too… (when I got out of rehab he had a nissan z she got him) ANYTHING for drugs he would do… Obviously that lifestyle never lasted for him though but even today he is still friends with her on Facebook (keeping her for future supply I assume) He hit the jackpot huh? Hahahhaa.

I could get revenge if I wanted to legally… Especially since he has multiple felonies but I think life in general will do just fine… I hope he burns alive in his own hell. There's no way a narc doesn't stop to think for a second about how much they hate themselves and their life no matter how good of a manipulative con artist they are getting a luxurious lifestyle out of ppl they take for granted and then discard them as if they were the ones who were damaged… Well good normal people dont live their lives stealing from the world & getting off on treating ppl like shit.

thank you… even though it happened last year and it lasted 6 months I still find myself having PTSD symptoms of it & finding myself angry that he could think that he never did anything wrong despite the horror he caused upon me & my family… its crazy… he would be in prison right now had I successfully testified against him in court but he purposely kept on the move living with different “supply” getting more destroyed by his constant meth use… I hear he is getting a lot more ugly, hardly has teeth as it is and it's only a matter of time before his insides turn “inside out” which is a pretty horrific sight :) I love that his life will go down the drain as time flies by his mere existence in this world… Abused or not during childhood… Its not an excuse to destroy everyone you come across… & think there won't be a price to pay… Such a loser lmao.

Yes meth is water soluble but you won't like waste it or anything if anything… you would be able to break the water down & smoke the residue that's left over… I used to microwave the water on a plate & scrape the meth up… but I quit recently and I take Naltrexone now… I suggest that also… Meth will ruin you before you know it & it turned my uncles wife into a walking dead zombie

Mine stole $800 from me & had a great elaborated story about how my money went missing, I think because he knew he wasn't on camera he got away with it... He also stole my wallet during a fight he started lol… Among so much more… They don't give a fuuuuuuuuck what they do to anyone they are so fucked in the head they will do anything at any cost to support their drug habit too… Mine I truly believe was low enough to even do gay shit with guys.

Hahaha dude seriously!!!! My narc HATED any time I would ever (caringly) tell him how people were talking badly of him & how upsetting it is to (finally know now that he was everything they said he was…) LOL his deep rooted insecurities would come to light & he would just go ape shit & get defensive & angry at me because how dare I tell him about his true self which is speaking a foreign language as it is because narcs literally have no acknowledgement for anything they have ever done & If I couldn't be the dumb weak girl he can manipulate (he would talk down about MY family just because they knew the real him & other people hated him too & wouldn't fall for his schemes…) If you aren't a little toy who he can make into his little puppet he will despise & destroy you just to take everything you have just because… It's YOUR fault… (that you allowed it & brought his wrath upon yourself) & (that he is such a piece of shit & will never have or be shit)

How do I explain that meth helps me to function in everyday task, cause I'm going on 3 yrs, active use?
I have been an addict for 5 years since 2015… Sooner or later it gets to the point to where you mentally believe you need it just to feel normal or function… I was sober for 2 months from April 24th to June 29th… Relapsed… And I can say for myself that I felt a lot more “able” to actually live my life and have the energy to get things done then I have felt lately being on it… Nobody ever stops to really consider the damage we are doing to ourselves and your brain will literally be too overwhelmed to ever let you know it's in danger but your body will show you in more ways you could probably ever imagine because meth just shuts you off completely… Your 5 times more likely to get a fatal stroke, heart attack or aneurysm while doing meth… We think we are invincible or that nothing bad will ha…

Will a narcissist say that their loved one is the one doing all the things that they are really doing?
ln my experience I noticed that my narc would project his BS onto me like he was so insecure it was hilarious, he was obvlious to the fact that he had flaws within his many personalities, he hated that I talked with anyone, even my best friend one time I tried to have a private convo with her and he started a fight over him feeling insecure about me talking bad about him, which was really me venting about the truth and his abuse, and tried to control or accuse me of doing things or making assumptions meanwhile he would have his phone encrypted & who knows what he was really doing but I never doubted it, he was an addict, criminal, con artist, master manipulater, and I was just one of his many victims… His own brother told me since he was 8 years old hes basically been a monster in the maki…

Thank you for sharing, you seem very intelligent and bright and like a good person… For me growing up with a brother who has autism is definitely different for me because i had to explain to my friends what it was & why he did the things he did & learn to grow & adapt. ..He didn't have any friends either, but he definitely has his family… and I think family is important, and honestly the best friend you can have is yourself at the end of the day because you will always be with YOU. But not everybody will be a friend or can be trusted in life… & maybe you too should reconnect with your family… I was told once that i had characteristics of Aspergers but i cant really make sense of it lol.

Among RENTAL CARS that had to be fixed that my dad paid for because I couldn't afford all that…) One of my brothers passsed away last year & I couldn't go to his funeral BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT THIS LOWLIFE ACCIDENTAL BIRTH OF A MONSTER be homeless on the streets… I lost my federal job of 2 years with the USPS, I had to file for bankruptcy & I left my wallet which I stupidly had 1700 in, he stole 800 & came up with a master excuse of what he says happened, & how dare I ever accuse him or call him out on his fucking insane bullshit because he will get abusive & violent (I had great credit at the time & decided to take out loans, never paid one bill, it all went to gambling, drugs, shopping etc. Taking care of his worthless ass) & living in my car, when I had my home & bed to sleep in, an actual loving family (because his was broken most of them on drugs, he was physically abused most of his childhood from his dad, & his mom was never around, strung out) Nobody liked him & many who knew of him had nothing good to say about him, he steals from anybody and everybody he was a con artist… My mom asked him what he loved about me & he said nothing… A family member asked him why he was with me & he said he would do anything or use anyone for drugs… (I'm still heartbroken by how good he was at living such a lie & playing his many acts) Anyone could sense the evil spewing from his soul-less dark presence… We currently have a no contact order (which has been broken on his part…) claiming to be happy for me LOL.

Reading comprehension is the ability to read an understand a text. The article you linked points out that for something to meet the definition of ‘inspiration porn’ it has to be inspiring and also disempowering. I have asked you to point out where the disempowering part is in Oprah’s story. We agree that there is inspiration, but I’m struggling to see how Oprah disempowers people in the example above.
I’ve asked you in good faith to point out the disempowering part, and you’ve regressed to childish insults, calling me illiterate.
Quora actually has a policy against disparaging and adversarial behaviour like this called the “Be Nice, Be Respectful” policy. What is Quora's ""Be Nice, Be Respectful"" policy? The policy specifically mentions “unfounded or absurd accusations,” insults as well as bullying.
Have you ever heard about a book called Don Quixote, or the phrase “tilting at windmills”?

ALL CAPS is shouting/screaming on the internet, always has been, always will be. Italic text is italics. SHOUTING LIKE THIS is different to italics like this. You might evoke different responses if you ease up on the screaming.
And I'm afraid that your questionable anti-Oprah behaviour is 100% in question.

You’re drawing a false equivalency, he is responding directly to you, a person wildly making desperate excuses, screaming in ALL CAPS at people talking in their indoor voices, and reaching a very long way to be offended. He’s not generalising about any of the groups that you invoke in your response, he’s addressing your behaviour.
Claiming that the vast majority of people who encounter trauma cannot recover is a horrifically stigmatising and hateful attitude to be promoting. People recover all the time. And nobody besides you has mentioned mental illness at all, so how can you possibly say that Ayus Hoel has “contempt” for people with lived experience of mental illness? Just by describing people with a lived experience of mental illness as “the mentally ill”, you are dehumanising them and demonstrating that you are in fact the prejudiced one.

I think you might be the one who misunderstood the original post. It’s a positive post about Oprah, and you hallucinated that it’s saying something negative about anyone who isn’t Oprah. The original post doesn’t say anything about non-Oprah’s being “inferior, or worthy of scorn,” in any way, shape or form. Can you please explain what Manish Sharma did wrong here, when he answered the question Can you tell me something inspiring? with something objectively inspiring?

This is really warped. People are resourceful and resilient in the face of adversity and they recover all the time. You are bending over backwards to try and find something that Oprah did wrong. Refusing to seek perpetual victimhood and making your way in the world regardless of what has happened in the past is not immoral behaviour. Wanting Oprah and anyone else who has been abused to give up their dreams, and lie down and die in order to be fair to those seeking victimhood is really sick, even for you.

It’s called alchemy, the “forbidden science” of lateral thinking condemned by the church. It lead to the founding of psychology and psychiatry and you could say the ‘big think’ film-makers like Kubric and Nolan are alchemists too. Still forbidden in mathematics as you need to “show your working” and have the right kind of proof.

Being genuine is about being genuine. What you are proposing is that they pretend to be genuine, which is counter-intuitive to actually being genuine. You rely on the presumption that the person is an attention seeker, or something else similarly negative.

Yes absolutely get help! I cannot stress this enough, unless you are on of the lucky few who are so mentally resilient they can deal with these things. I am not one of those and from the sounds of it you aren’t either. The thing is you’ll never know if you need the help if you don’t actually go and get help. Stuff like this, especially from a young age, can damage you without you even realising. So yes, go get help!
I am so so sorry this happened to you. You’ve made the first step by asking a question on here. Just remember that you are the victim, do not feel shame or guilt about it, as it was something out of your control. Believe in yourself and be strong.
Wishing all the best.

I completely understand where you’re coming from - but all of the negatives you have described can be applied to any form of entertainment, literature, TV, music they can all cause the negatives that you describe.
So yes you are right people can use them for escapist reasons (even though I actually believe a level of escapism is normal and necessary) and other negative reasons but I wouldn’t blame video games or any media, it’s more of a human thing.

Actually you couldn’t be more wrong. I can understand that a lot of people hate hip hop because it’s different - and has a bad reputation, however to say that Kanye has no musical ability, even if you don’t like his music is absurd.
I can appreciate that the topics that Kanye deals with can on the surface appear meaningless and money orientated but that is just the nature of his life. He is a strange, unstable individual who has made various odd life decisions, but to dismiss his music on those grounds just doesn’t seem like anything other than you don’t like his music.
Also Kanye was originally known for actually being a producer, so you know, he actually made his own music. Obviously as time has gone on he has involved many other people to help him make his more recent work - so I can understand questioning his musical ability based on how his recent music has been created, but originally he did fully produce his own music - and I just can’t see how you can claim he has no musical ability when lyrics and voice aside, he actually produced the rest of the music which to me actually demonstrates that he has at least some level of musical ability.

Although I understand how evil narcissists can be - I wouldn’t really suggest doing any of the above. Move on, be the better person, be blunt and honest. You made a mistake in being with them (even though it really isn’t your fault, I detest victim blaming but you do need to accept that you were part of the relationship).
Narcissists aren’t healthy, mentally stable people - and should be treated as such!
EDIT: I am young and unfamiliar with being in such a relationship so please accept my comment as a purely personal perspective.

How do you prove to your ex that you are not a narcissist, without looking like your hovering? I was a drunk and drug user, sober since our breakup. It's been well over a year without her and I've never experienced this type of pain and emptiness.
Simple answer unfortunately, you don’t. it doesn’t matter that you are sober now - because that isn’t the you that she knows. The best thing you can try and do is move on and accept your mistakes. I’d suggest looking at getting some therapy or at least visiting a doctor and describing your feelings of emptiness. I can only speak from experience and offer you my perspective, maybe she would like to reconnect, maybe she doesn’t, I really can’t tell you what to do. Personally I would go no further than sending her a message and apologising. Do not expect anything - the more you think about her the worse it will get and unfortunately this was just part of your development as a person. I apologise if I sound negative in any way - but honestly I believe that the past is the past and you can’t change…

What can I do in the next half-hour to make myself less depressed?
Grab a drink, preferably non-caffeinated with no sugar. Put some nostalgic music on. Sit outside. Dress comfortably. Focus on your breathing. Think of everything you do have - not what you don’t have. Think of your family, your pet or your friends (if you are blessed enough to have any of those things). If you feel like crying, let it out. Let your emotions out, just release everything and be in the moment. Of course none of these things will fix your depression and I truly understand from personal experience that when you are depressed it is incredibly hard to make yourself less depressed and just by thinking about it can make it worse. I find reflecting upon my life, my experiences, the good and the bad can help. Understand that you are who you are, there is no easy fix, and if you didn’t…

Whenever I think about a particular thing my heart tighten and I feel a pain in my heart . Even if my mind is diverted, I just cannot shake that feeling off . Plzz can someone tell me what is my problem?
It depends on what that specific thing is. If it is something negative, which I strongly presume it is, then it could definitely be to do with anxiety or event to an extent some level of PTSD. Speaking for myself, I know that I have very similar feelings when my mind thinks back to negative memories that I’ve had in the past, and just by thinking of them it triggers the exact feeling that I got when the event actually happens. Past traumatic memories in particular, but I’ve found that whenever that happens I force myself to understand that the past is the past and that i need to be in the present - coupled with some breathing excercises. If whatever it is not very nice to think about, I can only suggest that you try and think about it objectively, without blame and guilt just accept it and…

5-hydroxytryptophan and similar compounds are naturally found in foods such as milk and turkey meat. This is a fairly low dose, so unless you have an underlying condition or take certain medications it is unlikely to cause any serious harm.
If you are taking another medication to improve your mood, adding this could increase your risk for a potentially life threatening condition known as seotonin syndrome. Some other OTC supplements may also increase this risk; so always discuss with your doctor to be sure it is safe for you.

methamphetamine is an ADHD medication, in treatment resistant cases as Desoxyn

ADHD medications are designed not to instantly produce euphoria, but to continually help reduce symptoms throughout the day.

It depends with regards to the nature of your reaction.
For example, constipation is fairly common and the I would try the following, going down the list and adding if one therapy does not suffice.
Eat enough fibre, both insoluble and soluble & drink water throughout the day
Exercise daily (eg 20 min brisk walk)
Use a stool softener every few days and/or magnesium
Increase to the maximum recommend amount of magnesium per day, best if taken with dinner.
Change your current stool softener if you haven’t already been taking it — to PEG3350 ie restoralax
Use peg3350 daily

Why do so some people say they function well on “5 or 6 hours of sleep” when research says we need 7-9 hours?
Some individuals actually need less sleep to feel well-rested.
There are also some that actually need 7 hrs but have never let themselves have more than 5 hours.
I believe 7hrs is a general middle to start off of, but you can only determine through experience, the amount that most benefits you. It could be 4 to 12 for the vast majority but this is a wide range as our knowledge is rather rudimentary is when it comes to individual differences in function of the brain.

Is it true that more people miss work for mental health issues than physical health?
It depends which statistics you are looking at, but from what I have seen, this is a definite yes .
Often times, those whom report that they cannot make it into work have been known to not disclose a mental health issue due to fear of stigmatization.
It is also important to note that physical health and mental health are connected, both literally and figuratively. So a stomach issue (enteric nervous system for the gut) is in communication with the central nervous system (the brain).

How did taking Prozac change your life?
Prozac alone does not necessarily change one’s life, assuming there are no profound side effects. I have taken prozac and it has been the most subtle behavioural health medication thus far. I noticed a slight reduction in feelings of social anxiety and feelings of rage and/or being trapped in crowds. For the first 7 weeks, it had increased such feelings slightly though.
Every brain is different so it is important to speak with your mental health professional to determine if there is a medication, such as prozac that can help you.
I hope that this helps.

Are psychotics born or made?
Well, a more accurate answer would be neither, or it’s complicated combination of the two.
A propensity for psychotic behaviour, or genetic vulnerability exists. It does not, however necessarily mean that environmental, social, psychological, and developmental advantages cannot ‘nullify’ this innate tendency.
A warm environment; with consistent parenting, social support, and unconditional positive regard may be enough to ward off psychosis.
Conversely, extremely abusive and inescapable childhood experiences tend to provoke dissociation - breaking from the present self (let’s assume they do not have an underlying predisposition). In this case, it can help that person survive such hardships and is actually a very adaptive behaviour.

What is the best way for one to implement natural supplements for ADD while still on Adderall 30 mg?
Augmenting with 200-300mg of magnesium (Lisa vangderhan is a good one in my opinion). This is assuming you are not taking any other medications etc. It acts as an NMDA antagonist, which basically means that you should take it at night.
It is thought to prevent excessive calcium efflux; and ward off tolerance to the Adderal.
Most of the American population is deficient in this mineral, plus it can be helpful for constipation.

How long does it take to feel the effects of a bad sleep schedule?
Good question :) I often hear people describing how they needed to ‘catch up’ on sleep on the weekend; when the best thing they can do is establish a regular wake up time. Once you do this, your body should naturally tell you when it is ready to head off to bed. Physically, you might not notice your sporadic schedule affecting you. Mentally, though, the effects are usually immediate. We have a circadian rhythm that the body really likes to follow…and it is actually slightly longer than 24 hours. This is recognized by your hypothalamus, which regulates things like energy levels, stress, appetite, metabolism, temperature regulation etc. and ‘talks’ to higher brain centers that govern things like executive function. This is why if you pull an all nighter, you will spontaneously feel much more en…

Does everyone feel rush from caffeine off the first sip of coffee?
No, technically the caffeine is going to take time to absorb and get into your blood stream for you to feel a ‘rush’. eg. 40 min However, there is often a placebo-like effect that comes to many individuals with the first sip of coffee. The ‘rush’ and the coffee have been paired enough times for you in the past; so they are associated with each other and an expectation of ‘rush’ exists. When we expect something, we often perceive it actually occurring! That is, much of what we take for granted as ‘real’ is actually a highly subjective reconstruction of that. A good example of this simplified expectation concept is phantom limb syndrome (check out research by Ramachandran if interested) .

Given that a direct correlation has been found between being hard of hearing and developing Alzheimer’s dementia, will wearing hearing aids reduce or eliminate that relationship?
In my opinion, I believe that there is more likely a common underlying factor such as something that causes a decreased sensitivity of certain aspects of our attention circuitry — that is largely responsible for the correlation. It seems unlikely to me that better hearing aids will decrease the incidence of AD.
That being said, better hearing aids should reduce the total proportion of individuals with hearing problems. So, this would also disproportionately have the effect of improving hearing abilities in the AD population if they make up a greater percentage of individuals who are ‘hard of hearing’.
This is assuming that the entire population has access to hearing aids. Perhaps some groups may be unable to afford them, or for some other reason not receive this aid. Why do you ask?

What is the difference between anti-psychotic medications and anti- anxiety medications?
There are many differences. This is no means a discussion of all of them; but here are a few basic differences….. In general, anti-psychotics decrease delusions (false beliefs) by decreasing activity in the meso-limbo-cortical dopamine brain circuit. This tends to decrease symptoms such as ‘hearing things’ (by decreasing activity in the auditory cortex/brain region). However, it also tends to decrease activity in the prefrontal cortex, or central executive center. So they tend to increase the negative (eg. lack of motivation and working memory) symptoms that are also a core feature of schizophrenia. Over time and/or in high doses, this class of medications can also lead to some motor issues, some of which may become permanent. The first-line anti-anxiety medications tend to increase levels o…

Is CBD a better option for treating mental health issues than mainstream medications like Zoloft, Lexapro, etc.?
In most cases, no CBD will not work for individuals. I have read literature and had a client case whose migranes responded extremely well, however. The best option is considering the information we know about how the brain works, and how different characteristics of an individual predict treatment outcome, then making an informed recommendation(s) to the patient. I am opposed to the typical treatment plan which almost inevitably starts with the hypothetical doctor presenting a big colourful chart of SSRIs and saying, choose one!

Does Adderall make BPD worse?
Generally, adderall is never given for bipolar depression as it tends to increase the propensity to have a hypomanic or experience full out manic symptoms. That being said, much of depressive episodes tend to correlate with disruptions in the executive functioning network, the ‘head’ being in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), that relies heavily on dopamine. This is increased with adderall and similar psychostimulant drugs. So, it really depends on your unique constellation of symptoms, predispositions, comorbidies, concurrent meds, etc. It is possible that the benefits could far outweigh potential risks.

Can excessive caffeine consumption cause Cushing’s syndrome?
The answer isn’t quite a simple yes or no. Caffeine increases cortisol, but so does candy.
Cushing’s is caused by excessive stress to the HPA or hypothalamopituitaryadrenal axis. In essence, we have way too much of a stress hormone called cortisol. Normally the body knows when there is too much around and takes a break.
In Cushing’s the body never gets a break. Caffeine is one aspect of the modern lifestyle that contributes to excessive Cortisol levels but rarely does so single handedly. The person would likely have a very stressful job, home life, financial situation etc. in addition to consuming excessive amounts of stimulants. This also tends to be a chronic condition, meaning that it takes time to develop.

Why has testosterone been steadily declining on average? Do you think it matters?
I believe the major reason is due to the obesity epidemic. Fat cells actually secrete hormones, and one of these is a kind of estrogen (female hormone).
The fact that our water is being polluted with birth control bills etc. Is in some cases, feminizing fish populations. It is thought that this could play a role.
We also live in a build environment and undergo fight or flight physiological processes too often. For example, driving to work Or even watching the news.
Bottom line is it’s complicated lol. It matters but there are many societal issues today that need immediate attention.

What pharmaceutical, behavioral, or electromagnetic methods are available to reduce or eliminate intrusive memories from traumatic or embarrassing events, and which work best in combination with others?
Currently, reduction of severity and frequency of symptoms is the realistically ideal situation. Behavioural methods are often used first, which if successful, aim to have the patient reprocess the trauma in a safe environment. Doing so should theoretically allow the hyperactive emotional circuits to calm down. Certain pharmaceuticals have been successfully employed in the therapeutic setting to help this process. Methamphetamine was used decades ago, removed by the FDA; but is now making a comeback. Other drugs that act as NMDA antagonists, such as propranolol are more common to minimize possible drug abuse. There is also an eye movement strategy that has made a difference in some very severe cases. It is important to keep in mind that we evolved this ability to increase vigilance in respons…

What is considered ""hyperactive"" regarding adult Onset ADHD?
Great question. Short version= talk to your doctor helpful info…Sometimes it can be hard to discern with adults because of traditional criteria developed for children in a classroom setting. This is improving in the industry though and among adults hyperactivity can manifest itself both in psycho and motor avenues. For example, a hyperactive adult might always be ‘on the go’ as if ‘driven by a motor’. My mother in law is a busy body. She is up and about switching around from one task to another as she pleases, and is described as very energetic, which I always envision as an ‘energizer bunny’. This is more motor, and generally this is what is emphasized in the latest DSM criteria and most behavioural tests I have come across for ADHD in research and reading. Now, some may argue that the mind…

What makes getting off Effexor difficult?
This drug has a relatively short half life in the body, which basically means that it is required to take doses with an increased frequency. So when the drug is discontinued abruptly, the body ‘runs out’ of effexor much more quickly than similar drugs, and the patient may be at an increased risk of side effects.
When we contrast this to something such as Paxil, which has a very long half life and thus stays around in the body for much longer, a missed dose tends to have the lower incidence of discontinuation syndrome… ie. scary side effects because there is still some in the blood to continue working somewhat.
Hope this helps clear it up!

Does caffeine intake affect people more as they get older, such as increased trouble sleeping?
Caffeine is metabolized by special enzymes in the liver known as the cytochrome P450 enzymes. They can convert an inactive drug to an active version, or such as in the case of caffeine, act as a deactivator of it rendering it not having the same effect that it normally would. Older people tend to have ‘lazier’ versions, meaning that it takes more time to degrade the same quantity of caffeine. Since it takes a 25 years old roughly 5 hours to degrade half of the dose, an older adult may have sleep difficulties because of the extra accumulation in their bodies associated with daily consumption. Sometimes side effects exacerbate preexisting sensitivities or conditions. As older adults also have trouble sleeping because of decreases in things like melatonin in the body, caffeine may be sufficient…

Do you lose calcium when you drink coffee?
Caffeine can have the above mentioned effect. The upsides could include the motivation to do some bone building load bearing exercise, and increasing the absorption of calcium from your digestive tract.
Ultimately it is important to understand that calcium balance in the body is very intricately regulated by many different systems. We always need some in our body fluids in order for our nervous systems to function, for instance. Generally, parathyroid hormone is one of the key ‘signals’ that tells the body to free some from our reserve, such as bone. At the same time, when ample calcium is available and the correct signals are present (eg. calcitonin), calcium can be stored into bone. We still do not completely understand the physiology of how this operates.

Is Clonidine the same as Klonopin?
No, it isn’t. Klonopin interferes with your deep sleep, and your body gets used to it quite quickly so it generally isn’t recommended until other viable options are ruled out. It is in the benzodiazepine class of anxiolytics; quite addictive too.
Clonidine is a completely different class of drug, which can be prescribed for many indications; and yes, sometimes for anxiety.

Is caffeine the best non prescription self-medication for ADHD?
First of all I would encourage you to get diagnosed and prescribed medication. Unfortunately, modern psychiatry is not a viable option for some individuals so they have turned to things such as Modafinil, ephedrine, and natural health products commonly marketed as pre-workout supplements. Keep in mind that these are not regulated, so may contain contaminants such as heavy metals. In my opinion, proper medications are often under-prescribed, which ultimately makes life even more difficult to go through for those afflicted with the condition. Caffeine has a long half life and essentially blocks adenosine receptors in your brain, which normally function to tell you to get sleepy. Since caffeine can quickly accumulate in the body, I would generally not recommend it as it can interfere with sleep…

How do caffeine and Prozac react with each other?
taken literally, there is minimal interaction as to how the drugs are absorbed and processed by the body.
However caffeine may increase side effects associated with stimulants. This varies greatly individually, and the combination is not generally recommended. The increase in excitatory activity could, for instance, lower one’s seizure threshold— making it easier to get one.

From my Personal Opinion North Korea’s aware of the danger of their acts towards South Korea and USA, but it’s only a matter of time to get more benefits from the coming agreement.

What do you think when people say ADHD is caused by the food we eat?
Since ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder present from birth, foods cannot directly cause ADHD. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that certain foods or food additives may affect certain individuals that have ADHD, causing symptoms to worsen. If this happens to someone with milder symptoms or undiagnosed ADHD, it might appear that the foods or additives may have caused it. One of the ways to find out if something is affecting you is an elimination diet. Keep a good journal, several times a day, charting your symptoms and how you feel. Then eliminate an item from your diet each week, or longer, and keep journaling remembering to enter the food that you have eliminated. Go all the way through your diet, or at least as far as you are willing to go, keeping the detailed journal the entire ti…

DJI drones are much more expensive than the one pictured! They’re great for longer-range reconnaissance but not easily disposable from an economic standpoint.
The one in the picture is perfectly capable (if it has a half-decent camera) for popping-up over a hill or grouping of trees or around a corner or to the top of a building to give a brief view and still make it back to base. Not all reconnaissance has to be long range, especially in urban combat.

Multiple rounds of antibiotics from the doctor, but the antibiotics would only knock it down for a short while, then it would be back. We’ve been assuming that part of the issue has been due to the fact I've had to be on a catheter for a few months and that it was a major contributor to the issue. About two, two and a half weeks ago I had an accident that caused some bleeding through the catheter. I didn’t immediately connect it to the accident, but I started running up to a 102 degree (F) temperature with terrible chills within a couple of hours.

Time and distance (space) are invariant, but SR claims that perceptions of time (time dilation) and space (length contraction) can be observer dependent? Are time dilation and length contraction real or just perceptions of observers? Can time dilate?
The effects of time dilation and length contraction are not “observer dependent”, it is frame-of-reference dependent. The frame-of-reference is the totality of the physical characteristics that a potential observer inhabits in relation to the totality if the physical characteristics of the space being observed. A quick, non-relativistic example may be made of the solar system. From the frame-of-reference on the surface of the Earth, the Sun appears to trace a moving arc through the sky that varies a little day-to-day throughout the year while the Earth appears to hold still. From the frame-of-reference above one of earth’s poles, the Earth can be seen to rotate around it’s axis and the Sun appears to make a figure eight-type path through the sky due to the Earth’s orbital position during the…

Everyone is a unique person, pretty much by definition. I think it should go without saying I have no actionable say on any other person’s situation. I do reserve the right to speak to a larger audience and try to explain my positions.
I’m a mostly healthy 60 year old male who had the misfortune to have had an invasive strep infection in my legs and the muscles, after enduring successive breaks first in my left kneecap and then my tight ankle. I have lost a lot of muscle and I exercise several times a day so I can walk out of here. Being in bed is a temporary thing, but bears directly on the subject of medical professionals and the human body.
I am a very modest person, I typically turned my back on my fiancé when both dressing and undressing even though we were both quite familiar with each other’s bodies. She thought it was the height of comedy, but I am who I am. I didn’t change in front of others in the gym, I was too body conscious. Even when I must be changed in physical rehabilitation, I make very sure my 2 roomies can’t see me and I require the door to the hall to be closed.
With medical personnel it has to be different if they are going be able to do their job. They’re like body mechanics, some of which open you up and work on the insides and others that change the fluids and oil, as it were, and keep it clean. Modesty in such circumstances between one and one’s medical personnel themselves is a stress factor on one’s self that is best dispensed with for physical and psychological comfort, as well as basic efficiency in care.
This applies only to medical personnel. I otherwise reserve the right to assert my own dignity as I see fit, quite tightly in most cases, as you assert yours.
A private though experiment for those who my read this: If one should have some great misfortune and end up in a hospital tomorrow with a catheter, for instance, what would you do? Stress out over the invasion of one’s person? Attempt to unplug oneself and try to leave? Decry the violations? Any other potential reactions that haven't occurred to me? All these are solely for a persons consideration, they’re not challenges I’m asking anyone to answer. I have no power or right to tell someone what is right or wrong, but I am definitely suggesting that a single invariable set of rules might not best serve anyone who happens to read this. Sometimes circumstances really do matter.
P.S. I see that I left out the matter of trust of one’s medical personnel. I’ll let people reflect on that as they see fit.

An American here, I respect your personal feelings, but I don’t understand why on earth does it matter? I’m in a nursing home, short-term thankfully, temporarily unable to get out of bed, thus necessarily in diapers for the time being. This morning I was just changed by a female who took the time to clean Mr. Happy and surrounding areas. I appreciated it very much because I like to stay clean down there. I have no problem with it, she’s seen a lot more than mine, and is just trying to get through her day, We talked briefly about how she came to her profession. Zero humiliation, or embarrassment.

A reduction in the number of immigration court judges during the previous president’s administration, along with the chronic underfunding of the immigration courts, plus congress’ refusal to increase either the number of immigration court judges or their funding in any way are the primary reasons why immigrants and asylum seekers have their first court dates that are already backed up by 2 or more years into the future.
Attending to that backlog in the immigration courts, along with (as Nelson Chen pointed out) the requirement for first safe country application rejections before allowing applications for asylum here in the U.S. would go a long way towards easing the immigration log jam at the southern border.
The filters that are supposed to be in place for asylum requests at the southern border in the U.S. are, i order, the first safe nation applications and rejections along the route of travel, the application process itself for asylum here in the U.S., and third, and most authoritatively our immigration courts where various factors may be weighed as needed.
Fixing the current regular immigration process, which once again requires congressional approval, should be given a much higher priority than it is currently given. Giving asylum seekers automatic representation before the immigration courts would be a nice addition, the system as currently instituted has many applicants before the courts required to represent themselves, which is patently unfair in the case of unaccompanied minors and such.

How do you avoid the overwhelm and subsequent procrastination if you have ADHD?
The way I am usually able to avoid the overwhelm and procrastinate cycle is by breaking down a large task into a series of subtasks, and if a subtask is still too big, I break it down too. Once you do that, then try and make a plan as to what subtask to do when. Make it as optimized as you wish, but don’t get too wrapped up in that part. My ideal length for a subtask is about 15 to 20 minutes. It works pretty well, though procrastination can still be an issue. I’m particularly bad about that.

A really good answer, answer from Hisfsa Mushtaq, but I have a serious bit of advice to pass along to the OP as well.
Please don’t rely on just your native intelligence to roll on through middle and high school. Make sure to learn how to learn while it’s still easy for you. Note taking, highlighting, discussions with teachers and fellow students, asking good questions in class, doing all of one’s homework even if it’s easy and seems pointless, reviewing notes even if you already know what they say. All of this is to learn good study habits while you’re still young enough to internalize them.
I blew through primary and secondary schools without taking notes, doing much homework unless it was for credit, or any of the things I mentioned above. It was an easy ride. Then I went to college and encountered difficult subjects and I had no clue how to go about studying for them. I didn’t even know how to take proper notes. The result was panic, academic pain, academic probation within my first year. It was ugly and one of the major contributing factors in my failing to complete college.

What would your IQ be if you got every question right on an IQ test?
If all questions on an IQ test are answered correctly, the test is invalidated. The test administrator would go up to the next educational level’s test and restart the test. The reason why is that the tests measure on a statistical distribution and if a person gets all of them right the result would be outside the part of the distribution that the test is designed for. The same goes if someone misses all of the questions. The test’s difficultly is usually designed to fit a certain educational achievement level. . I don’t know which test the test was, none of us really knew that there were different types of tests. According to a friend of mine, way back in 9th grade, he was concerned that he might be stupid.

Caffeine appears, at least on the surface, to have a small but useful effect overall on my ADHD. The caffeine does help my ADHD, but it’s not a pronounced effect, it’s more of a longer-term supporting effect. I can easily take 200mg of caffeine an hour or two before bed and then sleep decently, without interruption. I’m fairly sure it didn’t have a major effect on my sleep because I’ve been 100% off caffeine for about 4 months now and I see no real change in my sleep quality with he exception of having to take a few daytime and evening naps.
The rest of my ADHD medications have little effect on my sleep as well. I take a whopping 200mg of Provigil in the morning and typically take a 2 hour nap after I get up to take said medication. I’m not immune to stimulants at all, I’m just resistant to some of the effects as far as sleep is concerned.

Does ADHD cause overeating? I’m not sure if I have ADHD, but does this sound like it? I eat to be stimulated, causing me to eat when I am bored and eat unhealthy.
Over-eating while bored is one of the behaviors often associated with ADHD. The eating part isn’t necessarily part a of it, but the continual grazing part really can be. It’s generally an absent-minded action, it’s very easy to not keep up with how much you eat, it’s the absent-mindedly continuing a process you intentionally started when you decided to get whatever you’re snacking on. Another dimension that may or may not be true in your particular case is that grazing behavior can be a self-soothing behavior or even a form of stimming. I find myself grazing a bag of chips or some such activity at times, particularly when I’m focused on something else. It’s nearly an automatic behavior. I have also come to realize that I personally have an eating disorder centered around over-eating, and th…

There is a large difference between taking a prescription, overseen by a medical professional and heavy drinking. Medications used for ADHD are performance-enhancing and serve a medical purpose. Alcohol is performance-dehancing, it is a depressant and does not help much of anything.

I was ahead of my class in all respects, but no matter how hard I tried, I kept getting in trouble, often major trouble. I even got in fights, often over minor stuff. I tried so hard to behave, but my impulsivity always got ahead of me. At home I always got into things that I should have known better than to get into, but that was no barrier to me, I did them anyway. Often it was driven by curiosity, other times I had temporarily forgotten that I wasn’t allowed to do something. That didn’t matter to my father, he had decided that corporal punishment was the way to correct my behavior, but of co…

I asked because I have had many different encounters with several different individuals, nearly all who have mutually exclusive interpretations of “woke”, so I felt it necessary to determine exactly what you meant.
Having had you and Campbell clear this up for me, I consider myself better informed on the subject than I had been. I’m soon off to look into some of these other ideas.
If I understand both of you correctly, we are talking about the specific strain of woke currently infesting many of the higher academic institutions, which brooks no dissent, and fights back against any new knowledge that is contrafactual to their established ideology. Is that too narrow a definition or is that close enough?
I do have to ask, are there really any people of significant stature that actually believe in the “Blank Slate”? Believing in it seems very counter-intuitive to me and seems to fly in the face of much of what we have learned about the brain, and how it grows and operates.

No, that won’t work. Think of them as fuzzy clouds that don't have an absolute position but are somewhere in that area. But even “that area” is a bit misleading because there is a tiny, but mathematically valid chance that it will actually be at some distance from that general cloud. It’s all probability and higher mathematics.
I am pretty good at calculus so i got a book that explains quantum physics all the way through, without pulling any punches. I opened it up, and on the first equation I discovered that I could recognize a symbol here and there that I knew. I just put the book back on the shelf and left it there. It’s that kind of math.

I think that Thom Hartman has a point, up to a point. I first read that idea from him a very long time time ago, late 90’s or early 00’s maybe, and I initially took to that idea. Good ideas were scarce at the time, many of the resources that people depend on today didn’t exists yet, or were in an early phase. Much less was known about our condition, and I don’t think that even the professionals had a clue as to how varied the ADHD experience is. Over time, as I learned more and more about ADHD, I eventually came to the conclusion that those types of roles are due more to the natural fit of some varieties of ADHD than a cause of the symptoms.
While having severe ADHD, combined type, I would make an absolutely terrible hunter because I spend too much time in my head, oblivious to my surroundings. Thom Hartman, especially the early stuff, had a lot to say about how he experienced his ADHD, and still mentions it from time to time, the last I heard. He has a lot of good ideas, but not all of them have turned out to be correct over time. But I’m still interested in hearing what he says about ADHD, he has some really good insights.

A cold object doesn’t radiate cold! It absorbs the heat that encounters the cold object. Insulation, wind barriers (as simple as a plastic sheet over the shielding regolith) helps keep the super thin atmosphere from conducting the heat away. Since the atmosphere is so thin, it doesn’t carry heat away the way it does on Earth, it the atmosphere in contact with the greenhouse at any particular moment can carry only a small fraction of the heat of an enclosed and insulated space. An object will always lose some heat due to radiation from the exterior surface, but that's what insulation is for, not to forget the fact that regolith, especially when a few meters thick, is a good insulator. And a polished coating can do a lot to keep the heat in from loss by radiation, think emergency thermal blankets. They’re amazingly effective.
About glass domes, quadruple-paned argon-filled sheets or blocks of glass would do just fine, there is no reason that we couldn't make them tomorrow. It wouldn't surprise me if someone is already making it for some exotic use already.

How does ADHD in adults affect emotional intelligence?
As someone who actually has ADHD, unlike the other three answers at this time, I am able to answer this question from experience. In severe cases, ADHD can be very damaging to your emotional intelligence. The inattention and distractability both can make it less likely to catch some those interpersonal signals that help cue you in to another's reactions to the current encounter. Sometimes that will end up looking uninterested or uncaring, and that can really irritate the neurotypicals. Missing those cues when young can cause the child to have problems connecting the dots between signals and feelings or intentions. When I was growing up, and still to this day, I was quite sensitive to someone else's pain. Physical or emotional, if I could sense it, I felt it too. But, and it's a big but, I ne…

Since this is a very low power application, likely just above a trickle charge level, don't worry so much about which charge balancer you get, it would be a low power application and ahouldnt present a high load at all..
BTW, have you considered measuring the solar cell output in bright sunlight, and the draw of the LEDs? It has occurred to me just now that it's possible that the battery capacity might not be the issue, it could be that the solar cell’s output might not be good enough to power the lights all night.

A charge balancer is a small circuit board that you could get for a few dollars on eBay. However they require soldering to install, and the connection of an extra two wires, one for each battery so the balancer can monitor the charge on each cell, and charge each cell to its full state.
If you're not familiar with soldering, or don't have space inside the light for the balancer, this idea should probably be filed under nice idea, too much trouble.
The size of a two cell balancer is usually about as long as an index finger and about as high and as wide as the width of a thumb. But there can be a fairly wide variance between manufacturers. I've not seen a small charge balancer larger than 18650 cell.

Due to differences in the actual capacity of the individual cells, if they are both charged at the same time, one is going to be chronically overcharged. Overcharging a lithium battery is a really bad idea, that's how they can get damaged and become a fire hazard. It takes a special circuit called a cell balancer to charge two lithium cells at the same time.
Long story short, the answer is that it's not safe to do that.

Maybe if his wife had just popped the bully the first time it might have been covered up by the bully out of humiliation. But once her face was pulverized by repeated smashing on the curb, it couldn't have been covered up, not even as an accident. At that point it's obvious to all that bully had the crap beaten out of her.
In the USA, schools nationwide have what ate called “zero tolerance policies”, which do not allow acts of violence of any kind, and that includes self defense, and in many places one can be punished just for passively being the recipient of bullying or an attack. After all, they were involved in the violence, so the school administration thinks. Punish them.
I'm definitely not saying that his wife shouldn't have retaliated! I might have done similar if I were in the same situation.

I'm a combined type and I've had trouble getting some people to understand that the wide variation in my apparent symptoms are not proof I'm lying about ADHD.

How do people with ADHD deal with the fact that normal people don't really like them?
I take issue with this question. I have been diagnosed with ADHD for 50 years now, a fairly severe case. Even with medication I have a number of difficulties, even as an adult. If anything the difficulties have gotten worse because I now have adult responsibilities. Stuff like forgetting court dates, things like that. I’ve very rarely had anyone dislike me just because I have ADHD. Most people don’t know I have ADHD, I don’t have a sign or anything advertising it. People I interact closely with frequently notice that I have certain behaviors that may annoy them, but they almost never know that they’re ADHD unless I tell them. If we have enough of a problem, they tell me about it and I either try to fix it or tell them tough. We settle it like adults. This has changed a bit in the past 15–20…

Where do you rank on the IQ scale from 0 to 180?
Without getting into the exact number, I’ve been formally evaluated 3 different timed with proper multi-part tests. My IQ has ranged over a 15 point range, so I have major questions that the numbers are very specific, more likely are general indicators as to range.
I tend to think of IQ in terms of Standard Deviations. I.e. if you’re out at the edge of one standard deviation you’re doing pretty decent, 2 standard deviations you’re edging on gifted, 3 standard deviations bordering on genius.

Here's a mind-blowing question about science: What if our current understanding of the universe is only a fraction of a much more complex reality, and there are dimensions and phenomena that we can't comprehend with our existing scientific framework?
That doesn’t seem particularly mind-blowing to me. It might be exactly what is going on! I’ve always had a very strong interest in science since a very early age, I would like to think I have a fair understanding of the philosophy behind it (science used to be called “natural philosophy” after all), how it operates and it’s capabilities and limitations. Science, by definition, will always be incomplete. Science is all about the observation of the world around us and then working to come up with coherent explanations of why we observe what we observe and then using that to try and extend our knowledge. Without getting into the scientific method, if we can’t yet detect something, or something is currently completely unknown, we really can’t analyze it yet, can we? Only when some part of somet…

Fellow people with ADHD would you want to not have it or get rid of it? Do you think you would still be you? Do you think it's apart of what makes you, you?
While I’m sure I would have been more successful in my chosen career track if I did not have ADHD, I would not be the person I am without it. Confusion, procrastination, hyperfocus and all.
As a direct answer, I would not want to get rid of it, I would not be myself without it, it is definitely part of what makes me who I am.

Is it possible to just buy single electronic components (specific transistors, resistors), like lego?
Generally yes, but that’s the most expensive way you can buy electronic components! When I’m at one of the online retailers, I look for the quantity at the first price break. Often you can get 10 of something for just a bit more than you’d pay for 1 of something. When you’re buying resistors, you can get great prices on 100 or so at a whack. I have several of each major type. Not all by any means because my space is limited, but maybe 20 different resistances. Don’t forget about shipping. With most companies you can buy $10 worth of parts and pay the exact same shipping as $250 worth of parts! And often you can get free shipping if you buy enough, but that can break a hobbyist budget very quickly. One inexpensive source of parts is older electronics that you can harvest parts from before recy…

Why do people with ADHD have trouble remembering their childhood?
I’m not sure at all that is a symptom of ADHD. Speaking personally, I remember most of my childhood extremely well, all the way down to smells, colors, who was standing where when they said something. There are quite a few instances that I wish I didn’t remember, too. Things that didn’t bother me at the time but these days I look back and marvel at my sheer ignorance. Not all my memories are this fully detailed, but many of them are, and my childhood ended long ago. There certainly are a few holes here and there, I would be surprised if there weren’t.

What is the correlation between addiction and ADHD?
Speaking in general terms, there is definite positive correlation between addiction disorder and ADHD. I don’t really know why, but from what I’ve gathered it’s closely related to dopamine and it’s distribution in the brain. Way too many people, seeking easy answers, hear “dopamine” and start looking for ways to increase their dopamine. This doesn’t work, other than the placebo effect, because it’s not the total amount of it in your brain that’s the problem, it’s the distribution that’s the problem. People with ADHD have a “hitch” in their stimulus-reward circuitry, which in large part is where our propensity for procrastination comes from. We don’t get the same boost from completing a project or making good progress on one, so there’s less incentive to do so. I can remember an awful lot of…

Even though I was much younger I had been working on trying to convince her that she absolutely didn’t look it.. When we went into the liquor store I hung back for a moment and told the clerk it was her birthday, and tried to slip him a couple bucks if he would card her. Her turned it down and when she took her stuff up front, he rather dramatically swept what she had put down on the counter back out of her reach and told her that they’d been having issues with underage people attempting to purchase beverages, and asked for her ID. She was a little surprised and complied. He looked at it and said “Really?” She agreed that was really her age. I gave him a quick thumbs up behind my back on the way out and she was smiling after we got back to her place. Mission accomplished!

Can you explain what it means to have attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to someone who doesn't have it and wants to know more about it?
I’ll take a stab at …
Next, symptom two. Is imagine you can almost never tell what time it is without actually looking at a clock. If you look away from the clock you forget the time. If you are doing something, often it takes much longer than you anticipate and then you’re low on time for everything else. else.¶

Automatically knowing the date is rare, it’s very easy to miss appointments unless you have them on a calendar and check it, sometimes multiple times a day. Laying out tasks for the day is difficult because you have no idea how long they will take to perform, and if you do have any ideas, they’re frequently wrong. That’s Time Blindness.¶

Oh geez, what else. Imagine, if you can, having your common sense on the slow track. You are able to think of, plan, and often execute actions before it occurs to you that it they may or may not be a good idea. Other times an idea seems so good, so golden, that you immediately execute it without realizing how hazardous it might be to you or others around you. Many times long-term consequences don’t occur to you without a lot of time and thought. It’s not that you can’t think, far from it, but the details just don’t come to mind without active thought and analysis. Okay, that basically covers Impulsiveness.¶

On the flip side of Inattention is Hyperattention. Most everyone has the experience of getting so into a sports or video game or a book or some other form of activity that you’re not aware of time passing and sometimes someone might have to call your name a couple of times to get your attention. With hyperattention, turn that up to 11. You, seemingly randomly, will get so engrossed in doing something that you become totally unaware of the passage of time. And I don’t mean a couple of hours. It can be a really, really long time. time.¶

For someone to break your attention, they often will have to either touch you, shake your shoulder, or get in between you and what you’re doing. You don’t become aware of extraneous sounds. To break on it’s own often requires discomfort or pain, though running out of task can do it too. It’s easy to keep doing something until a bathroom break becomes an emergency. You can get desperately hungry before you notice, you can sit in a painful position until you actually get cramps from it. it.¶

Many times I’ve become aware that I can’t concentrate anymore, and when I check my blood sugar I’m down in the 50s (bad!). I’ve been known to blow most of an entire day and have no concept of how long I’ve been at it. I think my record is somewhere around 11 to 12 hours or so, and that time I barely made it to the bathroom and while I was on the way I wasn’t sure I’d make it there in time! In some ways it’s great, glorious even, like a payback for all the time you couldn’t concentrate on something. But it’s something.¶

The hyperattention is like lightening. You can’t make it strike when you want or need it. It just happens. Sometimes I’ll be reading. Other time working on a project. Other times I’ll be looking out the window and noticed something that draws my attention and I can sit like that for a LONG time, apparently doing nothing, while I’m actually analyzing leaf patterns of a tree or something else useless. Hyperattention. It’s a love/hate type thing.¶

Then there is the constant lack of attention to detail. No matter how hard you try, something, sometimes many somethings, can slip your attention while you’re on a task of some sort. The details are pretty much task dependent, so it’s hard to give examples, but not thinking ahead to plan for problems is common. Not bringing enough paper to write on, not having something to write with, bringing the wrong equipment for the task, and so on. You on.¶

For some examples, you might go out on a job site and forget something important, like extension cords for your tools. Forget drop cloths if your a painter. It varies massively by task. My big problem is studying something and getting so into it that I forget to take notes, which means I’ll often have to go over something again. Other again.¶

Some times the hyperattention seems to misfire. I can read for a bit, then realize I have no idea what I’ve read, and when I check it’s been several pages since I recall what I’ve read. I’m not sure about that one, but I think that somehow we process the writing, but mechanically, not thinking about it, so there isn’t much to remember. So, you have to back up and re-read the appropriate sections.¶

Take the above paragraphs and apply all of it to relationships. Not just romantic relationships, but with anyone. You had an appointment with someone? Forget it, or sometimes think that today is a different day of the week. Something else grabs your attention when you’re talking with someone and what they see is a lack of interest in the conversation. You can try hard, so hard, to stay focused on a conversation, but sometimes you just can’t. That’s really bad when talking with your date or your significant other, or your boss. Forget your anniversary? Check. Check.¶

During any sort of conversation it is so very hard not to immediately begin talking about your idea you just had even though someone else is speaking. It’s a battle not to interrupt, almost always in conversations. It’s also hard to listen when you’re trying not to interrupt. It goes on and on like this, many different permutations of these.¶

I feel like I’ve just barely touched the top of what’s going on inside our heads pretty much all the time. Its natural for us, it is just the way we are. We’re actually built this way, that’s why it’s called neurodivergent, neurodivergence, our brains are really different actually wired a bit differently from yours. Many times it seems very unfair to us to have this constant societal insistence on punctuality, on minor details, sometimes even manners. manners¶

We usually live in the now, not the soon or a little later or a lot later. When we want pizza, we don’t plan for pizza night later in the week, we pick up the phone or hit the website for the favored source of pizza. It’s a problem that people think we should stay on task for a long time, sometimes time. Sometimes it’s really important to us to follow the “obvious” (to us) chain of associations that seem really important, and even for us it can be hard to explain why camera lenses are related to cheese toast, but it seems important some how. That’s a real example from my life, by the way.

As a person with ADHD, how was your first experience when you started taking an effective medication?
It’s been a REALLY long time ago now, but I remember finishing schoolwork that I’d never been able to do before. I would always get really bored with it and often get up and go around the room and help other people with their schoolwork. The catch being that I never finished my own. I didn’t see the problem with that because I obviously knew what I was doing, but of course the teacher didn’t see it that way. I tried and tried to finish, but I just couldn’t, I would get agitated, have to move, move, move.
The first time they put me on Ritalin I was so proud I could actually finish my worksheets and I couldn’t understand why everyone else was just “uh-huh” and didn’t think it remarkable at all. I was still heavily distractible and impulsive, but it was a lot better and I could read longer.

I started taking Ritalin a few days ago and noticed that I struggle to find words and or completely say another word when on rebound effect, should this concern me? I have a high langauge IQ but have always struggled with forgetting words or them coming out wrong- I am bilingual too though I speak both languages fluently. But after the Ritalin wears off it is much worse than normal. I also can't express myself or communicate as well as before.
I can’t do anything but give you a bit of advice. When you get a dramatic side effect like that kind of language problem, immediately stop taking the medicine and contact the provider who prescribed it! Sudden language problems hint at a cortical issue of some sort. It might be a rare known side effect that goes away after a bit, or it might be a sign of a major complication that could have dire effects. The person most equipped to know this are your provider and Doctors of Pharmacy, whose job it is to specifically deal with various pharmaceutical effects. I don’t think you’re going to find a PhD Pharm around here, though I suppose you might be lucky, but I would do your best to contact your provider ASAP, as in tomorrow morning.

How do you really push through physical pain?
The way I’ve learned to lessen my perceive pain is in two parts. First things first. My general level of pain is about a 5 of 10, peaking up to around a 7 if I have to stand up or move. I can move a rough maximum of 30 feet per attempt. Doing what I describe following this, I keep my perceived pain at about a 3 when I’m doing something, and it still peaks at about a 7 when I move, but I do my thing and have a different attitude about it now. The first thing is do is a psychological angle.

I read a story somewhere, I wish I could remember where, where the intra-solar system ships had a bunch of ice held in a net around the ships, and tapped into the ice for reaction mass for nuclear drives. The ice did double duty by intercepting dust and such before it hit the hull. They refilled the ice at various stations around the system located at natural sources of ice, plentiful in the outer system.

That would depend on how it’s produced. If it’s done by imitating mass, a much smaller mass closer to the “floor” would work as well, but even then that would be a large pseudo-mass. The way it’s generally handled in the general way is called “grav plates”, which are part of/underneath the regular flooring plates and have a gravitational attraction to things close to them. I would guess it’s a field of some sort that imitates gravities attractive effects, not actually generating real gravity. I’ve seen sci-fi every now and then talk about the strange effects that the multiple levels of grav-fields have in various ships, having zones with unpredictable behaviors and null zones and such, making it a matter of engineering to get all the fields to play nice. I seem to recall something of that nature in one of the newer Star Trek movies where it showed someone sitting on the ceiling because in that area the gravity was inverted.

One dentist even had a record that played a hypnosis session to relax patients and reduce their level of pain.

What is the 'fight or flight' response? Does everyone experience it in stressful situations?
The basic “fight or flight” response is exactly that. When in not just a stressful situation but one that feel very dangerous to an individual, their more basic wiring for survival kicks in automatically. The level of danger or stress varies greatly between people, so I can’t really say what defines dangerous, it’s different for most people. But when flight or flight kicks in, you either tend to go for a fighting type mode to fight against what is happening (even if that reaction won’t help in the situation), or you may go into a semi-paralysis where, way back in our evolution, an individual would freeze in place and hope to not draw the attention of the danger, usually a predator, or you may go into full flight mode, which is to escape the threat.

Why do I learn so slow with ADHD? Brain exercises don't work as they should. It looks like my neuroplasticity is impaired. How does ADHD impair my brain's ability to change? Are there ways to improve learning rate at least similar to other people?
I don’t think that ADHD inhibits neuroplasticity much if at all. Learning physical tasks still works normally for people with ADHD, so there’s that data point. I learn very well and I have rather severe ADHD that requires medication with more than one medication. The problem I have with learning is (drum roll please) a lack of attention. If I can’t get something into my head in the first place, I can’t learn it. Much of what I’ve learned about my ADHD is how to get something into my head in the first place.

I’m in Georgia and I don’t know what the law is, but I know of two people that had allowed their vehicles to be searched, in both cases they were left with the contents of their car dumped by the side of the road and the police just drove off and left them after they were done. The woman I know that had it happen even had some of her door panels removed, though she was lucky enough they didn’t break anything much, just some fasteners. The officers dumped her ashtray on the floor of her car to sort through the ashes for any roaches or such, dumped out the glove box, the trunk, her purse, her backpack, everything that might hold something in it. Including the box of car supplies in the trunk. Everything. They even fiddled around up under the dashboard, in the engine compartment, and of course the trunk as mentioned. After they found nothing of interest at all, they just left her on the side of the road in the late evening with everything in a couple of piles. Her dad had to have it towed to the shop to have the doors put back together, the rear seat put back in and so on. He Was Not Pleased but was not able to get so much as an apology from the police department.
Don’t volunteer to let them search the car and if you can, get pictures of what it looked like beforehand and afterwards so you have some sort of documentation.
Don’t be nasty with the police or excessively confrontational or anything like that to piss them off, just politely refuse the request. Keep in mind that they’re asking because if they had probable cause to search your car, they wouldn’t be asking your permission. If they bring a dog to search, pay close attention to the commands and motions the office makes, does he keep tapping an area of the car, does he give any commands that sound like he’s telling the dog to indicate, anything like that.

I think I have ADHD but I’m too scared to ask my parents to get me a test. I have all the symptoms. What should I do?
I know that not everyone has supportive parents, and as I was lucky enough way back when in the stone age to have parents who, thought they didn’t understand it, worked really hard to help me. I’m not very qualified to address why you’re scared to ask your parents about a test, but if possible, address that in some way, try to figure out if your just feel shy or maybe intimidated about it, or are they just difficult to approach in general. If they’re actively the non-helpful type you would have to get very indirect to try and deal with that. Have you ever mentioned ADHD to them? Do they think it’s a bogus diagnosis, or do they think that there’s no way their child could have it? I don’t know why you are scared to ask them, I’m just throwing out some ideas here. The best way to get help, by f…

They used a physical medium to determine when to switch the channels, sort of like a player piano would use (no idea if it was paper or what), modern microprocessors go about the channel hopping in a different manner, but it’s the same most basic idea.

What do you do when people make you feel that you're meddling with their business, when the truth is you just want to help them?
What do you do in that situation? Stop meddling! Some people don’t want outside interference for starters, and butting into a situation because you want to help is ultimately a selfish act, you’re doing something because You want to, not necessarily because they need you to. If you get the urge to get into someone else’s business, ask if you can help, and if they say no, don’t do it. You can explore being supportive from the outside, try to make things you do more amenable to what they’re trying to do, i.e. work at not being an impediment, but a person’s business is strictly their business unless it already involves you, in which case it’s already your business. I get wanting to help people, by nature I’m a very helpful type, but many time people absolutely don’t appreciate someone else invo…

How do people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) feel when they are told ""you're so smart""?
I feel flattered.
ADHD has no effect on your intelligence at all, it can strike anywhere on the intelligence spectrum. l People of below average, average, and above average intelligence might have ADHD, it’s equal opportunity.
What ADHD does is act as a hinderance in almost all areas that require sustained attention, be it studying, staying alert on watch, doing any sort of repetitive task really. It causes difficulty with the ability to manage time. I certainly have trouble with impulse control. But it does not affect my intelligence, it just means that I have to work harder in certain ways to achieve the ends that I desire.

You couldn't be more wrong if you made the effort to be so. Please don’t insert your misunderstandings and prejudices of a valid and continuously improving branch of medical treatment into a serious question on a medical issue. You might not be a personal fan of psychiatric treatments, but please don’t actively spread conspiracy theories.
I’ve seen many people with bipolar, it can vary from fairly mild and be able to be managed with minimal medication to bipolar issues where the manic phase approaches psychotic behaviors and the lows approach catatonia. Most sufferers of bipolar disorder are in between and many can manage a normal(ish) life with medications of various sorts.
Some of the biochemical and structural basis of bipolar and related disorders has been uncovered in the past few years, it is a very active field for neurologists, the people who actually study the brain and it’s functions. In particular some connectome issues have been exposed in the past year that are involved with an entire group of issues.
A psychiatrist treats Behavior, not the brain. Much as a computer administrator doesn’t deal with the underlaying hardware but work with altering the behavior of the machine, so psychiatrists, and to a lesser extent psychologists work with the behaviors and such of the patients, who definitely exhibit classes of symptoms that are diagnosable and treatable.

Are severe sustained procrastination and crippling fear of failure possible symptoms of ADHD?
Procrastination is surely a symptom of ADHD. In particular, time blindness can result in significant procrastination simply because they aren’t away of that passage of time and that their deadline is soon or already passed. It’s also really difficult to self-motivate sometimes, particularly when they task isn’t interesting or in an uninteresting phase. The crippling fear of possible failure isn’t in itself, as far as I know, a symptom of ADHD itself, but could well be a reaction to the behavior of those in authority when they encounter repeated procrastination. My father was not understanding of the procrastination that went along with with my ADHD and he put a lot of pressure on me anytime that I was “failing to get things done” as he put it.

I noticed a common trait of high IQ people is the ability to learn quickly. Does the fact that I don’t learn quickly mean I’m low IQ?
Not necessarily. While people with high IQs do tend to pick up things faster, when it comes to learning they have a head start, but what really makes the difference isn’t IQ, it’s knowing how to learn.
Learning takes many different forms, but all of them involve repetition and practice, and learning how to do that isn’t necessarily as easy as they sound. There are a lot of online resources on how to learn, usually categorized as how to study. Look them up if you are interested in knowing more.

I just did some research.
There is a TicToc joke video going around where someone pretends to be just such a person.
There have been some people, known as “Furries”, that since the late eighties or so have taken to some sort of fantasy play that they are actually cats. I knew a couple way back when, I have no doubt that they would jump at the chance to claim they identified as cats, but I guarantee that they don’t use litter boxes, lay in the sun 16 hours a day, or as long as there is sun at least, eat cat food, and so on, all of which is more or less necessary to “identify” as a cat.
There is much more to identifying as something that just saying so, you need to do so to at least some degree. If someone just says they identify as something, they might or might not, the devil is in the details.

Can fiber powder help decrease a person's appetite?
Yes, it can be quite helpful, but you have to have a decent amount of fiber and a good bit of water to go with it. They go together, fiber without much water can choke you pretty badly in your upper system, especially when you swallow, and it can give you rather drastic constipation as it gets to your stomach and absorbs the liquids in there and makes a dense mass. Just don’t do it, its dangerous and unpleasant. It’s best to make it at least a full cup (8oz, or around 225ml) of water. More water than that won’t hurt or dilute it or anything. As for dosage, either follow the product’s recommendation, or aim for between 5g and 10g of fiber in a dose. Much more than that can be a really moving experience! If you’ve never taken fiber before, take 5g or so. If you’re used to taking fiber or eati…

I have ADHD diagnosed by a doctor. I feel like I never do anything right and it’s hard to control urges and pay attention to things I’m not interested in. Am I just lazy or is it my ADHD?
Yes, much of it is very likely your ADHD making you feel as if you might be lazy. Everything you mention in your question is something that we ADHD-ers live with every day. I’ve often been overly harsh with myself when I compare myself with my friends, they seemingly do so many things without effort that I have felt really bad about my motivation and abilities in the past. It took me a long time to learn that in many cases, comparing myself, a non-neurotypical, with the neurotypical friends of mine is an apples to oranges comparison. Letting myself make that comparison just stressed me a good bit and accomplished nothing useful. That doesn’t give us a free pass, though. We have a much harder time with organization, completing projects or plans on time or even at all for that matter, directing our attention, time-blindness, and impulse control. But we’re not incapable of these things, they’re just harder to varying degrees, meaning that we have to work harder at them to get the results we usually want. The time-blindness in particular can make us look lazy to others because when we are doing something other that what we should be concentrating on, or even just taking a break from the task, it’s difficult to be aware of the lapsed time, making it look like we’re just goofing around rather than performing our task. Repeated attention failures while working and then having to bring ourselves back to task takes time, resulting in the task taking longer to perform that it strictly requires. The neurotypicals usually don’t understand that without explanation and even then it’s not intuitive to them. It really appears to them as being lazy. In my opinion, if they realized the gargantuan efforts of will it takes to get some things done they wouldn’t be so critical. There are some things you can do to help this. Without turning into a how-to, you can try things suck as task reminders, be they on your phone, on your computer, or on post-it notes can be very helpful. Timers of various sorts can help you regulate your time. I frequently use a timer when I take a break so I won’t wander off into the mental grass somewhere and get lost for a time. If someone is reasonably close to you and you feel comfortable opening up to them, you can try and educate them on how ADHD works in the hopes that they won’t be as critical of minor lapses. I’ve found that the people who really accept and understand what ADHD is don’t give me so much trouble as they generally will assist in bringing me back on task and understand some lapses. Many times such a person will actively assist you, but that’s not something you can count on with others. So, long story made short, you’re not being lazy, you’re afflicted with ADHD, which makes these things you ask about more likely. Please don’t spend too much time questioning yourself, spend that time figuring out how you can implement ways to help you adapt. Best of Luck!

If you have iron hard skin and enhance strength, what third power would you choose to complement and enhance the two powers?
Personally, enhanced endurance would be my first choice. Being very strong without having the endurance to keep going would seem to be a waste. If the enhanced endurance comes along with the enhanced strength, I would go for either enhanced speed or rapid healing, depending on the general circumstances. If I had to pick without knowing the circumstances, I would tend in the direction of the rapid healing. If someone is super strong and has hardened skin, I would think that they might get into a lot of situations where they could be injured, perhaps quite severely. While enhanced speed might help avoid getting hurt at times, it wont do to help anything once you are injured. If I were designing a character, the choices would be made either because of character concept or made for survivability…

I have severe ADHD. I’ve definitely had it all my life.
My mother was aware even before I was born that there was something different about me, I was extremely active towards the end of her pregnancy, she said it was like having a jumping bean inside her.
After I was born I was reportedly a hyperactive nightmare. I didn’t have a schedule like most babies do, I was just randomly and rather intensely active.
Initially while growing up she had trouble keeping up with me, anything could, and would, catch my attention and I could get into things at a moments notice. She’s said if I was quiet she knew I was into something.
ADHD is definitely from birth, it’s just that many times it’s not really noticed until later, such as you mentioned about often not being noticed until at school.

I have been thinking about that for a bit now and I have a suggestion as to what it might be, though it’s really not much more than a SWAG.
I think it’s hyperattention on something without the active engagement we normally get when we hyperfocus on something more material. Like it’s sort of a hyperfocus misfire maybe. When I “snap out of it”, I often feel like I’m coming out of hyperfocus, but that’s just a sensation, nothing definitive. Often a sensation of having sat too long in one position without moving, sort of stiff.
I do remember a specific incident from many years ago, back when I was in college. I was vaguely aware that I had been staring out of a window in the cafeteria, off into the trees, for quite some time. A woman, no details noticed, sat very close to my line of sight while I was looking out the window, vaguely annoying because she eclipsed part of my view. After some unknown period of time I half-noticed she seemed agitated, many short abrupt movements, no idea at the time why, I was still just staring out the window. Eventually she abruptly moved and sat down elsewhere, out of my line of sight. I came out of it a bit later and looked over at her, she was rather pointedly ignoring me. I think what happened is that when she sat down in my line of sight and then noticed my stare, she thought I was staring at her, and she got angry and eventually abruptly moved off to the side. When she saw I was still staring out the window in the same place I guess she decided I was just daydreaming or maybe on something and ignored me after that. I have zero memory of her hair color, how she might have been dressed, or anything else. Just the shape and some movements that I later interpreted.
If anyone else has any ideas on zoning out, I’d like to hear them.

How long can a person with ADHD space out?
A really long time. The longest that I know for sure that I’ve tuned out for is about 20 minutes straight. A friend noticed that I had started staring into the distance and noted the time on the clock. I resumed normal concentration roughly 20 minutes later. I’ve had time rather inexplicably vanish on me before, I presume that I’ve spaced out for more extended time in the past, but I don’t know for how long. Certainly less than an hour but likely more than 30 minutes.

Do people with ADHD learn better by writing things down?
In short, yes. Nearly everyone remembers better by writing things down. To be ADHD-specific for a moment, I find that doing that can help focus my attention on the task at hand. Learning information is easier when using multiple different ways of getting data into your brain. If you just see it, like in a book, or just hear it, that’s only a start. The brain appears to prioritize remembering data that it encounters more than once. You can take advantage of this by multiplying the different avenues of input for the same data. When reading something from a book, read it out loud (doesn’t need to be very loud, just vocalize a tiny bit) to yourself while writing it down. That’s 3 avenues right there. A bit later you can go back over your notes and read them out loud to yourself again. Depending o…

Zinc and fish oil are a good basic start towards helping your ADHD medications work better. Some of the most effective ways you can get the most out of your medications are entirely natural, but if you’re not already doing them they can be difficult for some. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, and eating a well-balanced diet can go quite a long way towards helping them work better. I’m trying not to be a racetam evangelist, but the racetam class of substances can do absolute wonders for ADHD.

My memories of that kid who just wanted to be able to participate in daily life with the “the normal people” are apparently still so raw that to my surprise I immediately started leaking tears. It’s extremely unusual for anything I read to have this kind of effect on me at all, especially before I have even finished reading it. I had thought all this was long in the past, but apparently not, it was just buried.
I’ve never been able to adequately convey to anyone else what being a child with ADHD was like, especially back in the 70’s before there was an accepted treatment other than Ritalin and no effective counseling was available to help with developing coping skills. Being stuck outside the candy store encapsulates that experience very well and in a way to which I think non-ADHD people might be able to relate.
I have debated for over than hour over whether I should delete this next paragraph or not, I’ve finally decided to leave it, minus all the lengthy and unnecessary verbiage.
The pain of wanting to be able to be normal, at least a little accepted, was so sharp at that time that I remember a 10 year old boy, sitting down in the woods next to the neighborhood creek, genuinely wishing he were dead. At age 10. Luckily for him it never occurred to him that he might be able to do something about that.
I could go on and on but I don’t have anything that I could add to your awesome post. Thank you, Renee'.

Can ADHD make someone yell more and not realize their loudness, and how can it affect others? Can ADHD makes someone very impatient?
I’m not sure about the yelling, unless it’s when you’re impatient or something, but ADHD can make you very, very impatient, and often, too.
One of the harder things that I do is waiting my turn in a conversation. Many times I feel as if I have to get my idea out NOW, before I lose the thread of thought. Other times I’m just eager to contribute to the conversation and I find it very nard to wait. I want to do it now! Not in 30 seconds or 2 minutes, now!
When my medication is wearing off or when I’m not on it, I even have problems waiting for the end of songs, I drive people a bit nuts in cars because I continually switch stations.
Chronic impatience, especially when it causes you internal distress, is on of the main symptoms of ADHD. It’s next of kin with Impulsiveness.

Why would someone go through a period of buying duplicates of things because they don’t remember buying them? I have ADHD, which may explain it. Can this be normal for ADHD or is this something I should worry about?
I have done this most of my life, sometimes much more than once for the same item. It wasn’t that much of a problem until electronics got really small (i.e. easy to misplace and easy to overlook during a search) and expensive. I have several sets of wireless earbuds that are pretty nice and duplicates of some of my music CDs (giving away my age a bit here). I can’t count how many duplicate USB cables I have, not to mention specialty USB adapters. Ditto for SATA cables and such. Small boxes of various medications seem to multiply when I’m not looking. It’s entirely normal for someone with ADHD to have such a lousy organizational system that they can’t find something that they already have and to be unsure enough about having it that they buy another one, generally thinking that they don’t ha…

I’m sure you honestly believe that you have never committed a felony, and you likely make efforts to make sure you obey all the laws that you know about. It’s the “know about” portion that is the issue. A great or federal that are not common sense on a fairly frequent basis and never know that you have done so unless you happen to cross someone’s radar in law enforcement and they happen to follow up on you for whatever reason.
In addition, many laws are so poorly written that they criminalize everyday actions undertaken by many people, and these laws can vary from state to state, and even city to city. Many are not felonies, but quite a few are. In particular, f you live in an area that’s over-policed, you can definitely get in a lot of trouble for what most would consider normal behavior.
As a simple example, assume that you take a controlled substance by legal prescription but only on an as-needed basis. You might well keep two or three doses of this medication in a small pillbox in your purse should you need it while out of the house. Depending on the precise chemical involved, crossing a state line without that medication being in its prescription bottle can be a drug trafficking felony.
Say you have a couple of Xanax (a benzodiazepine), or a hydrocodone or two (a narcotic) with you because you have a panic disorder or just had oral surgery, that’s all it would take in the wrong circumstance to become a federal felon. You might avoid conviction by showing up in court with a proper prescription dated before the incident in question, but you would still have an arrest on your record.
In my state, just having certain drugs not in the proper prescription bottle while not in your primary dwelling is simple possession of a controlled substance. I’ve been warned about this from officers being nice to me about some controlled substances I often have to carry with me, so now I have to tote entire bottles of certain prescriptions with me if I want to have them available when not at home.

I’m sorry you had to go through that, being accused of wanting attention and such. Like we’re after all that negative attention! Just having people realize that you are dealing with an innate issue really can help with some of the stress, I hope that the people around you know are more understanding.
I’m very lucky in this regard. I was officially diagnosed when I was 9, way back when it was just called hyperactivity (1972). I was put on ritalin, which helped a lot but not nearly enough. My family, especially my parents, really tried to help me with it, but they didn’t have any real resources to learn from, so they just winged it. Overall I think they did okay, I managed to graduate high school and get some college in under my belt before life intervened. The only family member that never understood was my grandfather, and I think he was ADHD himself, medium severity, go figure.
I’ve had friends refuse to accept that I have ADHD, but that’s usually due to their misconceptions about what ADHD is. They seem to think that if I can pay attention at all that I don’t have it. I’ve rarely bothered to explain, they can believe as they please.
Another facet of ADHD is the impulsiveness, and I have the childhood injuries, and some as an adult, to show for it. No telling how many concussions I must have had with all of the bicycle wrecks and falls I had. I’ve had so many that I’m actually concerned about ongoing damage from it. I guess I’ll find out as I get older.

Adult ADHD. How does it affect YOU personally in your day to day life?
Adult ADHD affects me every day in almost every way. I am intensely time-blind. I don’t know what time it is without a clock, I have very little sense of time passing and I can never tell you how much if it’s over 2 or 3 minutes. I don’t have a long-term sense of time either. Many times, you can ask me about an event which I remember quite well, could tell you what happened in a fair amount of detail, who was there, etc., but I couldn’t even tell you what year it happened unless the year was an explicit part of the memory, such as graduation or something along those lines.

The first thing that occurs to me that would give that general result is a crankcase explosion. PCV valves on the older cars, Positive Crankcase Ventilation, used engine vacuum to meter air drawn through the crankcase to scavenge the “blow-by” gasses, fuel-air mixture that leaked in small amounts around the compression rings and into the crankcase during compression. During combustion, burning gases in small amounts would also leak around the rings and could ignite the blow-by gases that were in the crankcase if they were at just the right concentration. The older the engine and the poorer the maintenance, the worse blow-by could be. It was easy enough to diagnose PCV issues, simply sniffing the back of the oil cap would allow you to smell the gasoline if it was happening much.
Fuel-air explosions depend on the overall ratio of fuel to air. There is a Lower Explosion Limit (LEL) where there isn’t enough fuel to power an explosion, and an Upper Explosion Limit (UEL) where there isn’t enough air to power an explosion. The overall fuel-air mixture had to be between these two limits to explode at all, and that’s part of what makes crankcase explosions rare. Given the volume of the particular crankcase involved, it would take quite a bit of accumulated blow-by to reach the LEL.
Older cars with PCV (thinking 60s, 70s and 80s where I have most of my experience) could have the PCV valves get clogged from dirty oil and general crud that inhabits the crankcase of most older cars, resulting in decreased or absent ventilation, thus allowing gasses to build up in the engines internal spaces. It was common enough that PCV valves were usually replaced as part of routine maintenance. Starting in the 90s the engineering in engines started calling for much tighter tolerances, reducing any blow-by and modern engines with their very tight tolerances probably have little if any significant blow-by.
In older V-8 engines, the crankcase explosion could, in the worst-case scenario, blow through the top of the engine, right through the valley cover, taking the intake manifold and carburetor with it with the intake manifold full of fuel-air mixture on it’s own and the carburetor full of gasoline which I imagine would add to the problem. I would presume that the over-pressure in the crankcase would also take out the valve covers, adding a bit more debris to the party.
I’ve never actually seen it happen or directly dealt with the aftermath, they were a thing mostly of the past by the time I started working on cars. With the explosion mostly contained in the crankcase and then under the hood, I can see how the explosion itself might sound very muffled.

What would constitute the chemistry of physics and the physics of chemistry? I thought of it while sitting on my porch eating and drinking breakfast and I'm wondering who else did too?
The Physics of Chemistry definitely has meaning. At the lowest levels, chemistry IS physics. The bonding of atoms, which makes up a great deal of chemistry, is described by quantum physics. The length of atomic bonds, their strength, the angles between atoms, how crystals form, what element reacts with what element to form a particular compound and it’s properties, all are determined by these physics. Quantum chemistry is a field of study on it’s own. Thermodynamics, also part of physics, constitutes much of the rest of chemistry. Even at the larger scale there is significant overlap between the two.
So, chemistry and physics are different facets of the same physical and statistical phenomena.

You’re correct, it’s the shape and especially the weight of the bottom of the craft that is the real trick here.
The bottom of the craft is extra-thick to absorb heat before it gets to the crew, and in most cases it’s solid or close to solid metal and includes a ablative ceramic or similar coating that takes the brunt of the the heat and slowly burns away during re-entry. The heat shield, which includes the heavy base of the craft, moves the center of mass very close to it because of it’s sheer mass, and the crew compartment weighs much less since it’s largely hollow with thinner sides and it tapers to the top, giving it much more surface area than weight. So, strange as it may seem, with the heaviest part going first, the center of pressure for the entire craft is located a bit behind the heat shield, well behind the center of mass so that the craft will stay in that orientation during the re-entry.
The small side thrusters are used before re-entry to aim the heat shield forward. I suppose it would tend to automatically self-orient during the beginning of re-entry, but it would be a very violent reorientation and probably an extremely violent wobble until it stabilizes, and the top and sides of the craft might take a fair amount of damage in the process. I’m sure the crew would not appreciate the experience, assuming they survived it.
If the craft starts to tilt during re-entry the top and sides are exposed to more pressure from the blast of atmosphere coming around the heat shield and the sides are pushed back towards the center. I don’t see how a properly designed craft would wobble enough off-center to have the blast damage the upper part, it would be pushed back towards the center well before it was directly exposed to the super-heated flow. As rough as the re-entry is, it’s not a super-stable arrangement, so the craft wobbles a small but significant amount, and not particularly gently either. When added to all the extra experienced gravities from the deceleration, it’s a really bumpy ride down.
Everything I mentioned above is a major simplification of all that goes on during re-entry. I can visualize the forces fairly well but I’m not good enough at describing the interplay among them, especially in a short post, for which I apologize. I find the whole subject to be very interesting, and my hat is really off to those engineers that came up with these ideas and make them work so reliably.

I remember from my model rocketry days that having the center of pressure behind the center of mass of a vehicle literally forces the vehicle to stay pointed forward. If it starts tilting away, the pressure on the back increases on the side that is moving away from the centerline of the vehicle and forces everything back in line. Sort of like a weather vane.vane or a dart. Most of the mass on one end and the center of pressure (the fins) much further back.
Interestingly, the farther apart the center of mass and the center of pressure are, the more stable a vehicle is, but the less maneuverable it becomes because it takes more control surface action to overcome that stabilizing pressure to remain pointed forward. In fact, when building a model rocket you didn’t want too much separation between the center of mass and the center of pressure because it became more and more sensitive to variations in the direction of the wind, and in extreme cases it would do what was called “weather cocking” and the rocket would promptly head into the wind and happily fly into the wind instead of going up as planned!
Conversely, the closer the centers of mass and pressure are together, the more potentially unstable the combination becomes, and the maneuverability increases because much less aerodynamic forces need to be imparted by the control surfaces to perform the maneuver.
If the center of pressure leads the center of mass the vehicle is inherently unstable and will tumble uncontrollably unless the control surfaces can react fast enough (much faster than a human can) to stabilized the flight.
The first stealth fighter (I can’t say about any of the later ones) actually had it’s center of pressure before it’s center of mass, making it inherently aerodynamically unstable. That’s why it was so “wobbly” and only computer controlled controlled surfaces allowed it to fly at all. I seem to remember that the computer made corrections many dozes of times per second.
The way this applies to the capsule’s reentry is that the heaviest part of the capsule goes first, putting the center of mass in front. The exact construction of the capsule will affect where the center of pressure is and exactly how stable the capsule is, but in any event aerobraking is a very dynamic affair and from everything I’ve heard an unguided reentry is a rough ride.

Hi My ADHD friends. Between Adderall and Ritalin which one works better for silencing internal thoughts?
Until recently (last decade or so), I would have said that they’re interchangeable in that respect, but a while back I tried out ritalin for a while to change up from my regular adderall and when I came back to adderall I found that my mind was remarkably quieter in regards to that little voice that is always trying to get my to notice everything else except what I’m trying to pay attention to, and that noxious impulse to just do something to see what happens is definitely quieter.

Do people with ADHD avoid eye contact?
I sometimes do tend avoid eye contact with some people because on occasion I’ll be off in my head somewhere and forget to break my gaze from time to time, which makes people think I’m trying to stare them down. Other times I’m being hyperattentive to the conversation and I’ll hold eye contact to the point where a friend told me it seems nearly maniacal. Its not a very good solution though because sometimes they think I’m not paying attention to them when I avoid much eye contact.
Often I have to stay conscious of my eye contact and measure it out appropriately. It can get very annoying for me at times.

That doesn’t automatically mean that you have ADHD, though it is certainly a possibility. Motivational problems can have their roots in a rather large number of different places. Anything from depression to boredom to ADHD. As far as studying better, the best short answer I can give you is to adopt a certain level of discipline. Set up a certain time to study. Make sure you plan ahead so that you will have everything you need to study. Make sure you have a snack to hand and something to drink.

Why would someone with ADD get aggressive from ADHD meds?
The first thing I would think about someone who get aggressive from their ADHD meds is that they are over-prescribed, followed closely by that they might be having a adverse reaction to them. Most people with ADHD will respond at least somewhat to stimulant medications, but not all people respond well. As an example, they might have anxiety as well, and a stimulant medication might accentuate that as well. There is also the possibility that they are not taking the medication as directed, getting too much of a dose that way.
Another explanation is a lack of tolerance for that type of medication. Not all ADHD medications are stimulants, perhaps they should speak with their prescriber and try one of the alternatives.

How can I cope with exhausting ADHD without medication?
I have a short personal list of things that help me get by with my ADHD with and without prescription medications. * Eat well, exercise at least 3 times a week, particularly in the morning. In the past I did not find extreme workouts to be of any more help that just a basic stay-in-shape routine. A mixture of aerobic exercise and mild weight training seems to work best for me. I’ve been told by any number of people that a Mediterranean Diet is probably best. * Make liberal use of notes (of various sorts), alarms to remind you when to do things, and timers as needed. I like to set timers for when I’m boiling water, when I’m washing or drying clothes, when I’m doing tasks where I might hyper-focus by accident, and so on. My Amazon Alexa is indispensable to me for timing, reminders, and alarms, I can set recurring or one-time alarms, I can create named timers and I can change anything on the fly. My Alexa doesn’t forget the way I do. It’s a very useful reminder to have. * I use nootropics when I must focus. My current stack is: 800mg L-Glutamine, 500mg of L-Tyrosine, 650mg of Choline Bitartrate (seems to be the real force behind this stack), 200mg of L-Theanine, and 200mg of Caffeine, which can be substituted by a similar amount of coffee. Some of these are the real boosters (the Choline and the Glutamine), others help take the sharp edge off of the boosters (the Tyrosine and Theanine (the active ingredient in green tea). I have had very good results with this stack, but I try not to use it too often because it seems to lose some effectiveness after a bit. Most I can really use it and get the full effect is about 3 or 4 times week. You can dose twice in one day if you must have an all-day boost but it might interfere with your sleep. For me it’s good for about 6 hours or so of good focus. I do take prescription medication as well, most of the time, (Adderall), and when I combine the Adderall and the nootropics, if someone doesn’t know it’s me they’re communicating with, sometimes they’re not sure it’s me. I get comments from various people about how plugged-in I seem to be at those times. The nootropics seem to open my mind so I think more clearly as well as helping with my concentration. Keep in mind that this stack may need to be changed a bit for your best effect and it’s possible that it might not do much for you. YMMV. * Make sure to take a decent multi-vitamin that covers your basic minerals as well. You don’t need to go vitamin packing, most vitamins, other than the fat soluble ones, tend to get any excess over what your body needs urinated out pretty quickly anyway. Fat soluble vitamins can be dangerous if taken in large amounts because they build up in the body over time. Unless you know you have any deficiencies, which you shouldn’t if you eat well, you really won’t need much in the way of vitamins. If you seem to have some odd problems, it might be worth going through a screening with your doctor. I finally did and discovered I was deficient to the point of requiring supplementation of both magnesium and Vitamin D. Who knew? * Keeping as best you cant to a strict schedule helps a lot. I make constant use of timers, alarms, and various notes (popups on my computer, sticky notes in certain places, a small notebook I carry in a pocket). The better I keep to a strict wake time and sleep time, the less exhausted I find myself and better able to work with my ADHD. Personally, I seem to require about 9 hours of sleep a night, that definitely varies among individuals, you’ll have to determine what is best for you. Take notes over a few weeks or months and vary your sleep time a bit in a regular way, find out how much you actually do need, not how much you think you should need. * Something that I think is essential when figuring out what works best for you is to keep a log of what you try, when you try it, what you expect it to do, and what it does if anything. Categorize results with a definite effect, probably effect, not sure, and no noticeable effect. If something actually seems to be harmful, make a special note. If you don’t keep this log, you won’t be able to optimize your life very well at all. You will be guessing, and you can fall into a trap of adding useless items to your schedule and wasting time, or you may miss something useful that helps in combination with something else. * My most important items (wallet, keys, notepad an pen, etc.) go in only three places. On my nightstand, in my hands, or in my pocket. I don’t just put one down for a moment, it’s too easy to get distracted and wander off. I’m very strict with myself over that and it’s been a quite some time since I’ve had to go looking for one of them. * Never leave the house without a small notepad and pen in a pocket. Many non-ADHD people do that too, especially writers and detail-oriented people. You can substitute the record function on your phone, but do your best to always have a way of recording information with you all the time. If something I really want to remember comes up, if I don’t have a way of noting it down, I will forget, and sometimes that can really cost you a lot.

How can I cope with exhausting ADHD without medication?
I have a short personal list of things that help me get by with my ADHD with and without prescription medications. * Eat well, exercise at least 3 times a week, particularly in the morning. In the past I did not find extreme workouts to be of any more help that just a basic stay-in-shape routine. A mixture of aerobic exercise and mild weight training seems to work best for me. I’ve been told by any number of people that a Mediterranean Diet is probably best. * Make liberal use of notes (of various sorts), alarms to remind you when to do things, and timers as needed. I like to set timers for when I’m boiling water, when I’m washing or drying clothes, when I’m doing tasks where I might hyper-focus by accident, and so on. My Amazon Alexa is indispensable to me for timing, reminders, and alarms, I can set recurring or one-time alarms, I can create named timers and I can change anything on the fly. My Alexa doesn’t forget the way I do. It’s a very useful reminder to have. * I use nootropics when I must focus. My current stack is: 800mg L-Glutamine, 500mg of L-Tyrosine, 650mg of Choline Bitartrate (seems to be the real force behind this stack), 200mg of L-Theanine, and 200mg of Caffeine, which can be substituted by a similar amount of coffee. Some of these are the real boosters (the Choline and the Glutamine), others help take the sharp edge off of the boosters (the Tyrosine and Theanine (the active ingredient in green tea). I have had very good results with this stack, but I try not to use it too often because it seems to lose some effectiveness after a bit. Most I can really use it and get the full effect is about 3 or 4 times week. You can dose twice in one day if you must have an all-day boost but it might interfere with your sleep. For me it’s good for about 6 hours or so of good focus. I do take prescription medication as well, most of the time, (Adderall), and when I combine the Adderall and the nootropics, if someone doesn’t know it’s me they’re communicating with, sometimes they’re not sure it’s me. I get comments from various people about how plugged-in I seem to be at those times. The nootropics seem to open my mind so I think more clearly as well as helping with my concentration. Keep in mind that this stack may need to be changed a bit for your best effect and it’s possible that it might not do much for you. YMMV. * Make sure to take a decent multi-vitamin that covers your basic minerals as well. You don’t need to go vitamin packing, most vitamins, other than the fat soluble ones, tend to get any excess over what your body needs urinated out pretty quickly anyway. Fat soluble vitamins can be dangerous if taken in large amounts because they build up in the body over time. Unless you know you have any deficiencies, which you shouldn’t if you eat well, you really won’t need much in the way of vitamins. If you seem to have some odd problems, it might be worth going through a screening with your doctor. I finally did and discovered I was deficient to the point of requiring supplementation of both magnesium and Vitamin D. Who knew? * Keeping as best you cant to a strict schedule helps a lot. I make constant use of timers, alarms, and various notes (popups on my computer, sticky notes in certain places, a small notebook I carry in a pocket). The better I keep to a strict wake time and sleep time, the less exhausted I find myself and better able to work with my ADHD. Personally, I seem to require about 9 hours of sleep a night, that definitely varies among individuals, you’ll have to determine what is best for you. Take notes over a few weeks or months and vary your sleep time a bit in a regular way, find out how much you actually do need, not how much you think you should need. * Something that I think is essential when figuring out what works best for you is to keep a log of what you try, when you try it, what you expect it to do, and what it does if anything. Categorize results with a definite effect, probably effect, not sure, and no noticeable effect. If something actually seems to be harmful, make a special note. If you don’t keep this log, you won’t be able to optimize your life very well at all. You will be guessing, and you can fall into a trap of adding useless items to your schedule and wasting time, or you may miss something useful that helps in combination with something else. * My most important items (wallet, keys, notepad an pen, etc.) go in only three places. On my nightstand, in my hands, or in my pocket. I don’t just put one down for a moment, it’s too easy to get distracted and wander off. I’m very strict with myself over that and it’s been a quite some time since I’ve had to go looking for one of them. * Never leave the house without a small notepad and pen in a pocket. Many non-ADHD people do that too, especially writers and detail-oriented people. You can substitute the record function on your phone, but do your best to always have a way of recording information with you all the time. If something I really want to remember comes up, if I don’t have a way of noting it down, I will forget, and sometimes that can really cost you a lot. Think of it as a portable memory booster. * If I have one overall suggestion, it’s to keep a notebook and record some of: how much you sleep, the ADHD issues you have, the changes your make and how they work, and anything else you think might be helpful in your ADHD journey.

Can I take half a Ritalin capsule?
My experience with Ritalin goes back to 1973. Yes, I’m getting to be an old-timer. If it’s just straight Ritalin, sure. You would just get an effect that’s not as strong. It tastes quite bad so if it’s full of powder take it in some way that keeps it off of your tongue. If it’s a tablet, just gently cut it with a sharp knife, or better yet a pill splitter. If it’s a time-release capsule, then definitely not. It would generally be absorbed quickly and all at once, and the effects are dose-dependent. It also would be used up in 4 hours or so. Enough Ritalin consumed all at once can give you a racing heart, high blood pressure, headache, upset stomach, increase the speed of your colon (being polite here) and in general make you feel quite unwell. Rather unpleasant sounding. It is dose-dependent…

What are some things that a person with ADHD cannot do for very long without getting bored?
Pretty much anything tedious or boring, though sometimes if you can make it into a game you can get more done. I find that reading anything that I am told I must read is very, very difficult for me to concentrate at all. I rather quickly find myself rereading sentences, then paragraphs, then I find I’ve turned a lot of pages and I both remember nothing and I’m so bored I can’t pay attention in the slightest. That’s about the time I start getting irritated. Long series of figures, such as balancing a check book. That gets annoying if it’s very long and then I lose interest. Sometimes I can force myself to complete the task, other times I’m so bored that I just space out or become anxious and have to find something that will engage my mind. Another thing that I get bored with quickly is waiting…

Much of that sounds very much like ADHD. I’m not a professional and therefore I cannot diagnose, but much of what you describe, from the general messiness and disorganization (what I have started calling my horizontal filing system), or the tunnel vision when something grabs your attention, all sounds very much like I feel when I get hyper-focused in on something that interests me.
I constantly misplace important items, so much so that I now have a place for certain things to always live if they aren’t in my pocket, they’re only in this one other place. I do not permit myself to put it anywhere but directly in front of me, in it’s home spot, or in my pocket. I haven’t lost my wallet for more than 5 minutes in at least a year, but I have to be draconian about that rule.
I have immense trouble keeping to a schedule. That’s something else that’s very ADHD. Having great ideas that are never acted upon is something that everyone has to some extent, but it seems to be a constant companion in those of us with ADHD. Something that is extremely common is starting many projects of whatever size, and never finishing them because your interest is captured by something else.
I would strongly suggest that you go through a proper ADHD screening with a psychologist or psychiatrist as I think you show very strong signs common to people with ADHD. Some things that are frequently comorbid with ADHD are anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. I sense some echoes of at least some anxiety in what you wrote, maybe some depression, I would suggest that you screen for these as well. Bipolar, I don’t know. It’s possible to have anxiety and depression but not be bipolar. I didn’t really get that feel, but as I said earlier, I’m not a professional and I cannot diagnose learning or psychological issues. Many times a few questions from a professional can be all it takes to rule out a condition, but it takes more information to positively diagnose these conditions.
Best of luck!

I learned auto mechanics in the 70’s and 80’s. Some of the vacuum control systems for timing and pollution control, as well as altitude compensation, were fairly complex analog controllers that were distributed all over the engine as a mass of vacuum hoses and often indecipherable little plastic parts of mysterious function, all driven by partial vacuums like you mentioned. Most mechanics had little if any knowledge of how they worked in any sort of detail, we just used the manufacturer instructions to troubleshoot by behavior and replace the indicated parts. After a while you became familiar with the common points of failure.
In addition, automatic transmissions were, and still are, primarily driven by hydraulic computers called the “valve body”. These days they are considerably augmented by electronic controls that interface with the valve body via solenoids, valves, and electronic sensors that feed data to and from the engine control computer. They were “programmed” by a complex thin flat plate between the two halves of the valve body with a number of calibrated metering holes and slots. Quite reliable I must say. I rarely saw a valve body failure, usually it was a internal gasket or other part that wore down or leaked, or a clogged filter.

I am unavoidably on disability and I feel useless much of the time, a burden on society. Never mind that I contributed to social security for years before I became disabled, I still feel like a leech. I would so much rather be contributing to society! I would be willing to trade body parts for the privilege of working at gainful employment!!
Anyone that thinks you can be comfortable on a fixed income has likely never tried it. I have a roof, food, and a computer, but not much else. No car. I have to plan ahead just for fast food. It’s a bare existence without even enough money for basic hobbies to while away the time. It’s just existence.
I just don’t understand the slackers that dream of such a life. UBI isn’t to be aspired to, that’s why it’s Basic! Of course if you’re homeless or unable to work for some reason, that’s what the UBI is meant to address.

Should people in the US be forced to work to qualify for Medicare?
I suspect you mean Medicaid, the low income medical help program.
The great majority of those on Medicaid that do not work are either disabled or underage, most adults on Medicaid are already working, many times more than one job.
There is no reason at all to add a work requirement, it fixes not problem and imposes an even heavier burden on those who already carry a large one.

Do people with ADD have an easier time learning (storing information) for longer compared to the average brain that is fully developed quicker?
I can only answer for myself.
If the information makes it in to my head in the first place, overcoming my inattention, the information tends to stick very well, other than something that falls prey to my time blindness. I can remember a great deal of what I learned as far back as high school quite well, but I am unable to tell when I learned something unless the memory has some sort of situational cue as to when it happened. My 40th class reunion was fairly recently, so some things have definitely stuck with me very well.

Can children with ADHD be taught how to meditate?
I’m sure children can be taught to meditate, but it would take someone who both knows how to meditate and also knows how to teach ADHD children in an accessible manner. Just practicing basic meditation where one focuses inward and learns to catch their minds as they wander and come back to their center. It’s excellent practice for dealing with distraction.
Personally, I think that would be an excellent idea. Since I’ve learned to meditate myself I have found it very useful for both marshalling my concentration and to help calm myself down and not be fidgety so much. It makes a nice addition to my medications as I cannot medically tolerate a large enough dose of Adderall to sufficiently overcome my symptoms. The meditation definitely helps with my ADHD.

Does meth work as a substitute for Adderall if it is unavailable for two weeks?
I wouldn’t even think about trying that!
The purity of the meth is completely unknown, no telling what else might be in it. In addition, you don’t know how strong it is, so you have absolutely no way of calibrating a dose that would be useful for ADHD without being overpowering.
It’s just not safe, much less advisable. I’d rather go without that use an unknown like meth. Not to mention the legal issues.

I’ve worked at a variety of auto repair places, all except one were exceptionally proud of their work and the way they treated customers. They didn’t need to advertise much, word of mouth worked very well in those places.
I worked for a wonderful shop for a decent while which then hired the owner’s brother as shop manager. He promptly started hard selling people various parts and procedures. He almost fired one of the best techs at the shop because the tech spoke with a customer in for a brake job to make sure she really wanted a brake job because her brakes were in such good shape. After that we ( the techs ) weren’t allowed to talk with the customers without the shop manager being there. I eventually found my way out of that place, it went from awesome to sketchy in just a few months.

I can’t count the number of times I tried to stop smoking. Easily a few dozen formal attempts. I finally stopped smoking after having been a heavy smoker for 20 years. I think that the only real reason I was able to quit was an opportune case of pneumonia that lasted for a couple of months, making it impossible to inhale smoke at all without an enormous and debilitating coughing fit, plus some nicotine gum to help with the crazy urges. Between the two of them I was able to make it through the initial cessation due to the pneumonia and the nicotine gum helped keep the cravings down for a few more months. Then I had to quit the nicotine gum, but that was much easier than the times I had tried to stop smoking.
This was 25 years ago, and not a week goes by without a major craving for a cigarette, sometimes several times in a week. I don’t think it’s every going to go away at this point.
Don’t start, I have severe asthma as a souvenir of my years of smoking, it’s been a really long time since I’ve been able to breath deeply and any significant exposure to pollutants caused me a major issue. Trust me, you DON”T want to take that chance. Everyone in my family except my brother and I that smoked has died of cancer. My father, both of my grandfathers, one grandmother even though she’d been quit for years, and my uncle. A lot of dead smokers or former smokers. Sometimes I feel like I got away with just a scratch, but as I age further we’ll see if I dodged it or not.

I know I have ADHD (undiagnosed) but I'm scared to tell my parents because I know they won’t believe me. What should I do?
Like the other answers say, you can’t be sure if you have ADHD or not without a proper diagnosis. Having a proper diagnosis opens the door for help from various quarters, such as some accommodations with your school work, medication, and the like.
One thing you can do now that can help a great deal, whether you have ADHD or not, is to get your life organized. There are an awful lot of answers on Quora already about coping behaviors to help with ADHD. Much of that revolves around notes to yourself, scheduling with calendars and daily planners, timers, alarms and such to help you stay on track and not forget things. Make good use of your phone and your computer to assist you in this. Make sure to do school work ahead of time to counteract the procrastination.

In physics, the energy (momentum) goes up with the square of the speed of the shell (velocity) and linearly with the mass of the shell.
Momentum = 1/2 x mass x velocity x velocity.
For example, if a shell moving at twice the speed has 4 times the momentum, which roughly mean 4 times the weight of armor needed.
Nobody is going to double the speed of the shells anytime soon, but due to what I explained above, but if a shell had a 10% boost in speed it would gain about 20% more energy.

Would it be better if people around you know you have ADHD? (Because that way they'll know why you do and can't do certain things at certain times.) Or is it better to not let them know? (As they might use it against you.)
I have no idea what most people do, but I keep it on a need-to-know basis. I base my decision to tell them on my knowledge of the type of people they are. Some real friends I might go ahead and tell, but as for a casual group, there’s no need to let anyone know unless your ADHD is causing a problem.
I’m not embarrassed by having ADHD, I do not consider myself abnormal in any way. People usually don’t need to know because many of them have an incomplete or actually wrong idea of what ADHD is. As a result, they will treat me differently or start giving advice on how to fix me. On occasion I’ve run into people that are actually hostile about it.

I’m in with you on that, I can either write or listen, but not both at the same time, or in close proximity to each other. In my case it’s rather strong ADHD, if I’m writing I can’t hear very well and vice versa, and I just can’t switch gears very quickly.

I like that analogy. Similar to another one that I heard a while back.
Imagine a glass that leaks at a steady rate. Every time you try and act normal that adds some water to the glass. If you add water faster than it drains, you start filling the glass and eventually it overflows.

Does putting ice on a pimple help it clear up quicker, or will it just leave you with a cold sore and scarring?
Just from experience, what you want to do with a pimple is to put moist heat on it. That will help with some with the swelling, and the extra heat will help clear out the infection or the residue. The longer the heat can be kept on, the better up to a point. Four times a day for 10 or 15 minutes will do wonders on certain pimples.
Ice on a pimple is only for active pain, to help numb it a bit. Cold will make it harder inside and restrict circulation around it, and in some cases can push the infection deeper if it’s used frequently.
The moral of the story is don’t use ice unless you either really need to because of pain, or because a doctor told you to do so for whatever reason.

If Britain supplies depleted uranium munitions for the Challenger 2 tanks in Ukraine, is it fair for Russia to respond with ""all options are on the table"", exactly the same as UK/US/Israel would if their enemies threatened using radioactive weapons?
Depleted uranium is called depleted because all of the radioactive isotopes have been removed, usually as part of the nuclear fuel refinement process.
DU used in weapons because it is very dense, therefore weighs a lot for a smaller size. This high density makes it very useful to use as a penetrator on a shell or other warhead.

Being convicted of something doesn’t do anything about your ability to be elected in the federal government.
To bar Trump from office he would have to either be convicted of something that would either fall under the umbrella of the 14th amendment prohibitions or be impeached and then convicted.
Amazingly enough, there’s no law that would prevent him from being elected even if he were in prison, though I can’t imagine how any work could get done under those circumstances.

In general people who go around telling someone how intelligent they are amuses me as long as they’re not really insistent that I acknowledge it. The most common reason I can think for someone that walks around full of themselves over how smart they are is that usually they are suffering from some sort of feeling of inadequacy and are trying to make themselves feel better.

If a 14-year-old scored 142 on an IQ test meant for adults, how would that translate for his IQ as a child?
If you just want the answer and nothing else, skip to the last paragraph. I directly know someone who had to take a more adult version of an IQ test at 14. He was the type that had bad ADHD and thought that he must be stupid because he couldn’t process even the basic classes that he took. He scored well on the tests, but he was essentially teaching himself. He would sit in class and either just stare out the window or read some sort of book during class and read the text book at home,. The first portion of the IQ test involved a section of questions (something like 10–15 of them) that were apparently supposed to be especially difficult and had something to do with either validating the rest of the test or functioning as some sort of scoring mechanism.

What do you wish people knew about ADHD?
What I wish people would understand about ADHD is that you simply cannot will yourself out of it.
“Try using some initiative”, “just try harder”, “you’re lazy”, “why aren’t you paying attention?”, “are you stupid?” and all the other crap we get sometimes, because some ignorant neurotypical type who doesn’t understand what ADHD does makes judgements based on that ignorance. I wish there was a general understanding that when a person is not neurotypical they usually aren’t suffering from a defect in personality or motivation, it’s that we’re working to overcome our symptoms, and that takes time and effort, and the details of that are different from person to person.
That’s about it. I could pick a few others items, but I think that a little understanding would go a really long way here.

My morals are fairly easily devised, as are most of ours (atheists in general) I think. Cooperate with others, respect their rights, refrain from behavior that we disapprove of in others, and so on. Help others out, they might help you later. To me it seems a no-brainer.
About the heavy Christian-bashing going on in this thread:
Plenty of Christians work hard to try and walk the walk. They might not always be successful, but lots of them do make the attempt. They’re also not the in-your-face Christians that we tend to remember encountering for the most part, so you likely wouldn’t know their religion unless you asked. Don’t assume that because they’re Christian they’re then in-your-face kind.
OTOH, I’ve run across plenty of issues when the word Evangelical (as one example) gets added to the word Christian. Even though some individuals are okay, the great majority of the ones I either know or have met are serious ass hats that seem to believe that all they have to do is say they’re saved and they get a get out of jail free card. They just talk the talk and walk as they please. They treat others like dirt, always trying to control other people and jockeying for advantage. They grew up being punished for any minor transgression and they think that it’s their duty to treat the rest of us that way. Those people are often perceived as being representative of Christians because they’re in your face and very loud about it, they draw the attention but really aren’t representative.
I’m not being political about this, but I’ve noticed that the Evangelical Christians aren’t the only ones with their heads up their butts. There is a brand of performative, strongly conservative leaning Christianity that frequently pops up in certain places, and not just in the South, though they’re more common here than in other areas (I think). These are the holier-than-thou performing Christians that spew their false piety around like so much fertilizer. These are the people that have those fake pamphlets that are designed to look like the ends of money sticking out of whatever encloses them. They typically have a bible verse on the lower part, and these types use them instead of tips at restaurants, typically on Sundays after church. Despicable. Prosperity Gospel, Mega-church nuts, they’re pretty present all the time and they just love to legislate their fears, prejudices, and rules.
But please don’t lump all Christians into the same category as those two, most of them are okay people and they already have a lot to cope with because they’re frequently major targets of the nasty Christians I mentioned earlier. Maybe we ought to make common cause with them to help straighten stuff out? I don’t know, it’s an idea.
As a peaceable atheist, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but that benefit only goes so far. My patience and tolerance for the two groups I noted above is on it’s last legs. Let’s give those types all the shit since they’re the major problem and let the other 3/4 of Christians off the hook.

Why are gifted people often not as successful as they should be?
Being intellectually gifted, which I think is the question you’re asking, isn’t necessarily all it’s cracked up to be. It takes a lot more than just intelligence to be successful, and native intelligence isn’t a very good predictor of success. Success and intelligence do naturally tend to go together somewhat because that intelligence is good for solving problems, having insights, and deciding courses of action. But without diligence things may not be done well, lacking sufficient effort little may get done, and with no vision for the future there is no map of where to go. Being really successful tends to have a lot of parts. Determination. Motivation. Problem-solving. Finding the right problem to solve. Mental, physical, educational skills are.

Yes, a person with ADHD could become a lawyer, I’ve spoken before with one that I knew about. I can think of a number of conflicts between ADHD symptomology and the work of being a lawyer that I imagine would make it a constant effort to stay organized and sufficiently up to date. I can also see hyperfocus being very beneficial if our person learns some about harnessing it. The difficulty would depend most on these three things, I think. The level of control over the ADHD symptoms is probably the most important one. Someone that cannot make themselves pay sufficient attention in the classes would be at a severe disadvantage and would make all the studying that happens outside of class that much more difficult as well. I would rate personal motivation as number two. Becoming a lawyer is far fr…

Does having a high IQ make adults with attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) more likely to be successful in life than those without a high IQ? Is this true for children as well?
Having a high IQ does not translate directly to a better outcome with ADHD and success, but it helps. IQ is only a measure of capacity or potential. It tells us nothing about motivation, creativity, or education, ability to plan and cooperate with others, all of which are vital to success in life. I believe that having a higher IQ, maybe up to 120 or so, will help compensate some for having ADHD, but the actual outcome taking those two factors into account will vary because the intensity of ADHD symptoms, which ADHD symptoms are present, and other factors like innate memory, insight and other qualities all work together in a mix to help determine the potential for success. I don’t really think that having an astronomical IQ is going to correct that much more for ADHD, I see ADHD is more of a…

Does consuming alcohol damage brain cells while you are using Ritalin during the same day?
No more than alcohol already damages brain cells. Unless imbibed repeatedly or in excess, alcohol doesn’t particularly damage brain cells, but it does inhibit their normal functioning. Getting drunk on a regular basis will damage brain cells due to alcohol toxicity. Keep in mind that toxic is the root word of “intoxication”.
Ritalin doesn’t really enter into that picture, it’s not particularly interactive with alcohol, but drinking alcohol while taking Ritalin will definitely render the point of taking the Ritalin moot when there is any overlap in the duration of effects.

I will assume you meant probable. /pedantic Forgetting isn’t a primary symptom of ADHD, what usually seems to happen is that the memory never forms in the first place, sometimes because the individual jumps to another subject before the first one sinks in, another way is that the person isn’t really paying full attention (fairly common) and the fact or whatever isn’t really able to sink into memory deeply enough to be converted to a long-term memory.

Is it wrong for a psychiatrist to prescribe Klonopin to an alcoholic who is still drinking?
I can’t make an ethical judgment as to right or wrong, but given how alcohol and Klonopin interact, someone is being serious delinquent when it comes to side effects and drug-drug integrations.
Klonopin is usually dispensed with the understanding that the person is not supposed to drink, you can get a very deadly combination with modest doses of both and simply stop breathing while you lay there in a stupor.
So I still can’t say it’s wrong because I’m not a licensed prescribing professional familiar with all the ins and outs of Klonopin, but it sure sound careless at best since Klonopin in contraindicated when the user consumes alcohol.

No, FL can’t make them do any they don’t want to do, and would have a lot of trouble stopping them from doing something they really wanted to do. Disney just has too much legal clout and money.
The House of the Mouse has an army of simply fantastic lawyers that could tie DeSantis up in knots for years, but that would take a lot of money, and they’re all about making money, not spending it. Ultimately I bet Disney will do whatever make the most monetary sense to them. The Disney parks are the big money-makers for the corporation. As much as I’m sure many of them would love to put their thumb in DeSantis’ eye they’ll end up keeping it relatively low key unless DeSantis gets even dumber and tries some sort of scorched earth strategy on them.
What I expect is for Disney to sue the ever livin’ hell out of FL if they don’t make good on all those bonds and such on all that property and improvements. I’d heard rumblings that the state might not follow their obligations, but I think that would really start quite a showdown. If FL does try that, pass around the popcorn, it’ll be a good show!

We come in all shapes, sizes, genders, intelligence levels and personalities. Some things that are absolute show-stoppers for me might be of absolutely no consequence for another. At certain point many of us, especially the more introverted types, come to recognize that there are some potential issues that can come up when interacting with non-ADHD people. As a group we tend to be impulsive, both in word and deed. Sometimes it is very hard to wait our turn in a conversation, I think probably for two reasons.

Oh, certainly some neurotypicals do dislike us for how they perceive we are, but I don’t think it’s a large enough group to group them all this way. There are just some assholes that think less of us because we’re not like them. Bigotry comes in all shapes, sizes and colors, disliking people over misperceived mental superiority is what I categorize as a “their problem”, most of the time. If they do make it my problem, I generally either directly bring the subject up and challenge them on it, though I’ve been known to get sneaky about it and try to show someone up. The only times it’s even been an issue was a few times at various jobs and I was generally able to work that out pretty well.
I definitely realize some of this disdain some of them show toward us. One my best friends, when I told him about my ADHD a long time ago, mid-80’s maybe, insisted that I couldn’t be like that because I was normal and smart. Even when I explained everything to him, he still thought that it must have been a quack that diagnosed me. I had to break it to him that I had been fully diagnosed 3 times by that time and had greatly benefitted from the medication given to me for it (back in the early days when only ritalin was around). He even pointed out how laser-like my focus could be, I tried to explain hyperfocus, but he just didn’t want to get it. We kept getting along fine after that, but I suspect he just privately made up his mind that I didn’t know what I was talking about. Either way it was solved.
Other people have immediately written me off because of it, but that doesn’t bother me so much. They’re perfectly welcome to go right on ahead and underestimate me, I can usually turn that to my major advantage.
I guess one of the things I’m trying to get at here is that the neurotypicals that look down on us are making a basic error, and if we look down on neurotypicals because some of them look down on us is making the general same type of error.
Personally, unless a group is so cohesive as to make them nearly mob- or cult-like it’s more to my advantage to treat them as individuals, both to accomplish whatever I’m up to, and to teach at least one of them the error of their ways. Then (hopefully) that information might spread to one or more of them.

There is an enormous distinction between being physically dependent on opioids and being addicted to them! Some of the other answers seem to be unaware of this rather large difference. Dependence means that the patient feels somewhat ill (depending on initial dosing) when suddenly discontinuing or conducting a large change in dosage of a medication. All it means is that their body is used to functioning with a certain amount of the medication in it and has come to expect that level to be present at all times. What has to be done is to taper down instead of stopping suddenly and they’ll be fine.

Can doctors tell I've tried to overdose? I'm 14 and took about 30 paracetamol pills back in October and have an appointment in April. I’m afraid they'll tell my parents.
Paracetamol overdose is a nasty way to die. If you didn’t die from taking that many, you rather likely have liver damage, and if they check liver functions they will not necessarily know the reason your liver isn’t up to full snuff, but they will know it’s not as healthy as it should be in a 14 year-old. If you have escaped liver damage you are fantastically lucky in that respect. Fatal levels of paracetamol typically start around 4,000 mg, which is typically 8 extra-strength tablets (500 mg each) and go up depending on body weight, health, prompt treatment and so on. It takes a day or two after the overdose to start showing symptoms of paracetamol poisoning, by which time it’s entirely too late to do anything about it. For about week or so after the onset of the symptoms, the person’s body…

I’m so sick of needing to do things 2-3 times because I keep forgetting simple basic things, despite my best efforts, because I have ADHD and thus mashed potatoes for brains. How do you not get down on yourself for that?
The way I avoid getting down on myself over my ADHD is very simple to state, but much harder to implement. Directly stated it’s “Accept yourself for who you are.” Much easier said than done. It’s take me years and years to get most of the way there and I still have a ways to go. You ought to start with realizing that your basic nature includes ADHD, it’s a part of who you are and one (among many) defining features. Coming to accept that and realize that you are not defective, just not typical, is the real start of coming to terms with it. Learning to work around the various issues you have the are ADHD-related are very important. There are many posts on this site that will give you a lot of leads on things to try, look them over and try them, don’t just look at them and tell yourself that it w…

I’m your basic garden-variety atheist who has respect for the philosophies promoted in the name of Jesus, though I don’t buy into the whole God/Messiah business. I find thi9s philosophy to be very enlightened. However I’m often disappointed by those most visible people who claim to be Christian, seemingly for their own advantage. I feel that too often people just say the words and don’t even try to live up to how they tell others to live.
I’m not really sure how to say the next part, this is the best I’ve come up with:
I feel like I need to say how much I deeply admire the way Jimmy Carter lives his faith. He has humbly walked the walk and serves as a excellent example of what a good Christian looks like. Regardless of what you may think of his political career, in my estimation the world is lucky to have had a man like him. May many others follow in his footsteps. The world would be a better place.

What did your family think when you started your ADHD medication? Positives/negatives?
My family was very pleased that something was available to help. I think they were getting close to the end of their mental rope. I just now asked my mom about any negatives, and all she said was that they were so thankful for the positives that she doesn’t remember any negatives at all. My parents took a short break (knowing me probably about 15 minutes) and then resumed chasing me down and keeping me out of stuff, though at a lesser pace. Personally, I don’t remember any negatives either. From my viewpoint there wasn’t that much of a change. I was, and still am, remarkably lacking in self-awareness.

What are your best techniques to do stuff with ADHD (do the dishes, clean my room, do my homework)?
I have to break down tasks to a ridiculous degree, then I use notes and alarms to do various tasks and sub-tasks. When it comes to dishes I set them to soak. After a time that I determine by how dirty they are and the alarm that I set goes off I come back and wash them or clean them a little and put them in the dishwasher, as needed.
I break room cleaning down, usually by surface or task. It might be clean off the desk, or get all the clothes off the floor and in a basket. I use notes and lists, and check items off as I do them so I have a better chance of getting things done. I also use an app to help me keep track of routine chores and appointments and such.

I call BS on “prioritise breathing”. I’m an asthma patient with reduced lung capacity and I can breathe just fine through a N-95 mask, and cloth masks (the kind that just protect others) is easy-peasy. I usually wear a N-95 plus a nice-looking cloth mask over it to increase the levels of filtering, if I catch Covid I likely wouldn’t survive.
You claim that viruses are smaller than the holes in a mask and therefore they do no good. Well, since you’ve made that claim I’ve got news for you, air molecules are 10s of thousands of times smaller than a virus, if you maintain that a virus cannot be stopped by a mask, then surely air wouldn’t be stopped?
Anyway, viruses don’t spread by themselves, they cling to or are embedded in small (and larger) droplets that will stay suspended in the air for some minutes after a person sheds them.

Does poor sleep quality amplify the effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?
I have definitely found that to be so.
If I don’t get a full night’s sleep, even just an hour or two short, I can tell the next day, I’m much more scattered. If that goes on for a few days and I get significantly short on sleep, I’m very much not myself, extremely fragmented, forgetful and disorganized, even when taking my medication.
If I want to be at full potential I have to be well slept, a decent workout, decently fed and medicated too.

Are you pro-registration (Iron Man) or against registration (Captain America)?
I am very much team Captain America. We’ve learned time and time again that having a specific register for some sorts of people but not others never turns out well for the people registered. Even benign registries can be abused.
For starters, consider Hitler and what he did with the registry of Jews and other sub-groups.
On a lesser scale, think about what happened in the United States with those of Japanese descent in WWII.
Which, by the way, is precisely why gun owners don’t want weapon registries. The original intent might be benign, for insurance or some similar purpose, but once someone else has the list all manner of unintended issues could arise.
Putting people on a list defined by characteristics just doesn’t seem to turn out well no matter how good the original intent.

Why do people with ADHD not think that if they do something, they might regret doing it?
Once you understand a little about ADHD it’s a fairly easy answer. ADHD is a problem with the executive function of the brain. The executive function oversees everything else, it’s like a governor. The issue comes in when you can think and formulate ideas, thoughts, words to speak, actions to perform, before you have a chance to mentally review them. Then you might continue on ahead with whatever came to mind, and then it occurs to you that it might not have been such a good idea if it even crosses your mind. The executive rarely reviews actions that have already been taken so it might not even hit you that you just did something unwise. So in effect the part that cautions you that maybe you shouldn’t say something, or shouldn’t do something, is slower than your ability to speak or act, and t…

Should there be no law against driving without a seatbelt? I think it’s dangerous and unwise to do so, but nothing worthy of Police pulling over to find an excuse to extort people by giving tickets for, unless they don’t put a seatbelt on a child.
While I would more naturally prefer that there be no law against not wearing a seatbelt, the reality is that people without seatbelts can become missiles when in a collision and frequently end up ejected from the vehicle, often injuring someone else on the way out or hitting another nearby vehicle and involving them in the accident. I used to be firmly against the seatbelt law. Not the idea of seatbelts, but a law requiring them. Then I was in a vehicle that had to brake really hard very suddenly and I become that missile myself. I wasn’t severely injured because I was in the back seat, but I was still thrown through and over the front seat (completely wrecking it) and against the top of the dashboard and windshield.

How long does it take to get an ADHD diagnosis after getting a prescription for Adderall?
That sounds entirely backwards, normally the question would be “how long does it take to get adderall after getting an ADHD diagnosis”?
Adderall should not be prescribed for someone without ADHD unless it is part of a Psychiatrist’s diagnostic process and is supervised by said doctor.
I have heard of 1-week trial prescriptions to see if it helps, in that case you should know within 3 or 4 doses if it helps or not. Usually the effects are pronounced for someone who has never been treated for ADHD before.

The subject turned out to be far more complex that I had originally thought.

After an impressive number of vials of blood were drawn and tested and I discussed my findings at length with my Endocrinologist, I discovered that there is no one proper level or even range for testosterone like there is for thyroxin or insulin.

I've been diagnosed with adult ADHD at 49. It makes sense of my issues, but I can't get medication. Is there a way?
There are two types of professionals that can prescribe the necessary medications. A Psychiatrist is a psychological professional that is also a MD and can prescribe, and a regular MD who can also prescribe. There are several medications that can help and doctors have different prescribing requirements for some of them, particularly those that contain amphetamine salts, like Adderall, and those that contain methylphenidate, such as Ritalin. There are also longer acting versions available of both of those. Many doctors are careful about prescribing the stimulants because so many people like to abuse them and some of them attempt to get ADHD diagnoses to get them.

How do you still your mind while meditating if you have attention deficit disorder (ADD)?
I’ve found that my meditation actually helps some with my ADHD. My meditation is what I would characterize as a little rocky at times. While I’m concentrating on my base I continually have thoughts flowing into and through my head, sometimes they hijack my stream of consciousness. When I catch it, sometimes immediately, sometimes after a good bit of time, I redirect my attention back to my base and continue on. I have to do that an awful lot. It’s a bit like exercising a muscle. As you spend more time in being aware that your attention has been hijacked and then bringing it back under control, you become more able to tell in regular life when you’ve let yourself get distracted and come more easily back to where you should have been. I still get distracted all the time, but I’m becoming more a…

Can they be in denial? Sure.
But I don’t think that many are in that sort of denial. Most of that denial comes from people who don’t understand ADHD and haven’t experienced it.

What are the risks of swallowing batteries? What are the possible symptoms of swallowing them accidentally/on purpose?
The results of swallowing batteries for any reason are very severe, frequently including the loss of life or lifetime scarring and maiming. If the battery is charged, it will immediately start conducting electricity in the stomach because hydrochloric acid is an excellent conductor. Some of the materials that the surface of which the battery is composed of will immediately start dissolving into the acid due to electrolysis, and the acid will begin attacking the battery material immediately. Typically that means metals in the stomach acid, and therefore absorbable through the lining of the stomach. Poisonous, painful. Some batteries are wrapped and insulated in various materials that will slow the onslaught of the dissolution of the battery, but not for all that long. Regardless of battery ch…

Why do people with ADHD or autism suffer in many cases from mental confusion?
When I have that kind of confusion it’s almost always because there are too many fine details in play and my attention issues make it hard to keep them straight. I suspect that’s the issue with most of us when that happens. It’s just detail overload when crossed with problems paying attention to All of the details.
Other than that, I don’t think we particularly get more confused than the neurotypicals, with perhaps the occasional exception of people with autism who reach their internal overload setpoint, wherever it might be, from too much input. But we all have a set point of our own, just different capacities for dealing with it.

Why do most online users dislike ADD/ADHD people on social media, internet forums and/or Q&A websites?
I haven’t really noticed that online users dislike people with ADHD so much as sometimes we can show behavior that is not what they expect. It’s not us that they dislike us so much as the negative behaviors (from their viewpoint) that we can exhibit at times. Some of those that immediately come to mind are: constantly changing the subject, or at the opposite end, following the subject relentlessly no matter what. Frequently forgetting details that we were given just a few minutes before, tendencies to interrupt and try to monopolize the conversation, and sometimes we exhibit sudden bursts of pure irritation for what the neurotypicals would consider scant reason but for us can be a really major issue. Another issue that I’ve encountered in many people with ADHD, but not enough to be sure if…

Someone asked me via private message about ADHD. Normally I don’t do much with private messages, but this time I responded. The person who asked me the question thinks that my responses should be turned into a post, and now that I’ve thought about it, I think he’s right.
Here is an edited version of what he asked me, with personal comments removed:
You wrote “you are self-educated and studies whatever happens to interest you”.
I share exactly the same thing. But it’s great. I don’t see it as an issue.
I was diagnosed last year with ADHD.
At age 29.
Concerta doesn’t work on me it seems. Even up to 72mg/day. Except for the one or two days of “rush” I feel while incrementing doses which stops me from extreme procrastination. But it doesn’t last.
I read on your bio when I invented you to answer a question of mine that you have been diagnosed very late. Or that you have years of experience about dealing with it.
Was just wondering if you could take some time and point me in the right directions. What worked for you.
My answer was broken up into a few paragraphs, here they are:
I don’t do too much via PM because if I write something long or complicated I like for people to be able to access it.
The first real point I have is that you need to learn what all your symptoms are. You’re probably strongly inattentive at times, but what form does it take? Are you there in the present, trying to understand what someone is saying and just not putting it together, or do you not even notice the person at all, or is it like something is pulling your attention away from the person and to something else, repeatedly? Knowing details like that can help you assess later how a treatment is working.
Try different medications if your doctor is willing, some people don’t react to one medication but very well to other medications. Know what your symptoms look like, keep some sort of diary about your symptoms, then try the medication, make more notes about how things are going, and then compare the two sections. It is not unusual at all to not feel your medications working while still getting a good deal of help from them.
As far as knowing yourself and your symptoms, ask your friends what their impressions of your abilities or disabilities are. Find out how they see you, and if they do you the honor of telling you everything, do not get angry over anything they say. Sometimes people get the wrong impressions and we need to correct those over time. If someone sees you as unmotivated or lazy, help them understand about realizing what time it is, how time blindness works for you, and demonstrate to them at various times that yes you are doing things you are supposed to.
Go ahead and look carefully around Quora, especially the ADHD and learning disabilities spaces, you will find a wealth of information.

Neurologically speaking, there are a lot of similarities between intense prayer and meditation. A good while back (decade, maybe more?) I read about a study of monks at a monastery and they found that they had the similar physical and mental benefits that were associated with meditation, such as being calm and centered, lower heart rate, lower blood pressure, things like that.

How can someone with Attention Deficit disorder (ADD) train themselves to have a better attention span and concentrate on things for a longer period of time without medication or supplements?
Without medication or supplements, what comes next is counselling and learning about ADHD and how to work around some of the problems, and meditation. Meditation gets a bad rap from a lot of people, but at it’s core, meditation is concentrating on the world inside your head. Early in meditation you learn how to concentrate on something, say your breathing, then keep concentrating on it. Sooner rather than later your attention will wander, you won’t be able to help it. When that happens you acknowledge to yourself that your attention wandered, take note of that, then go back to concentrating on whatever you have chose to concentrate on. Normally people start of trying it for 10 minutes at a time, and slowly increase that time as you get better. Attention is sort of like a muscle, exercise it…

Yes, definitely. Children with ADHD have a number of problems that could benefit from therapy. The first thing that occurs to me is therapy for all the irritation and exasperation that builds up so quickly in people with ADHD. Especially when you’re young, but even still as an adult, impatience is a major issue with us. It gets irritating to listen to someone else talk when you have something to say, it’s easy to give into a flash of anger when offended in some way, and holding that anger or impatience in has it’s on cost in irritation and the like.

How can somebody with ADHD study better, more efficiently, and faster? I have a hard time finding a technique to study and when I do find it, it takes too much time and I'm too close to the deadline.
Other answers to the question are very good too, be sure to look them over. Unfortunately there is no good answer to this question, and there is no magic system or technique that will impart information extra rapidly. There are efficient and inefficient ways to study, but there’s no “trick” to it. You need to study smart, and use effective techniques. The techniques that work best will vary from person to person. By and large, this what I’ve learned about studying over the last 50 or so years, and much of it applies to everyone, not just ADHD people. For starters, no two people with ADHD are alike, and even when they are similar there are a number of different styles of learning that work well for some people and not so well for others.

I pretty much understand both of you in this one. I’m very, very ADD and I can suddenly remember people like that. It just occurred to me the other day that I hadn’t talked to a friend since 2016 or so… but it’s not like he’s reached out to me either, so I still consider us friends-not-in-contact. In this guy’s case I’d suspect he could be busy and it just hasn’t penetrated his skull (yet) that he hasn’t talked to you in a while, even with messages from you coming in. He’s a college professor that runs a department too, plus a home life, so he’s one busy camper.
If I don’t answer a text immediately, I generally forget I’m supposed to, which is bad when I’m busy. I can get a text, stop long enough to look at it, realize I can’t answer just now, and promise myself I’ll get right back to them as soon as I can, then go back to work. For me it’s like the interruption never happened, I totally forget that I was supposed to text back . I might even think that I did respond briefly and just don’t remember it.
Unfortunately I can’t say if you’re being ignored our just outside his horizon of the moment. When you add in time blindness, which is just what it sounds like, he might not even realize it’s been that long.
Or he’s not. There is just no way I can tell, not being him, and what you suspect can go either way and be correct. I do know that when I don’t want to deal with someone often my reflex is to just drop contact until I’m not annoyed as much, rather than be in contact and angry with them. Think back a bit, have your more recent interactions with him been stressful for him as far as you know? It needn’t be your fault, it could have been an encounter with a third person(s) or a situation. I wouldn’t necessarily need to be upset with the person to distance myself. If they’re associated with some sort of frustration or something my mind can conflate that and my first reflex is always avoidance. Not all ADHD people are avoidant, but an awful lot of us are. When we’re younger sometimes you know ahead of time you won’t be able to handle a situation and it’s natural to avoid a situation like that, and if it happens enough it can become second nature.
I’m sorry I can set your mind at ease one way or the other. The best thing I can say is something I don’t know if you can do. Put him on the mental back burner for a while, maybe a couple of months. Try to take the anxiety and immediacy out of the feeling if you can. If you haven’t heard from him, try some sort of direct communication if you can, phone call, something like that. If you still can’t get a return contact, I’d start thinking along the lines of having been ghosted, which always sucks.
If might help if you have friends in common to sound them out on anything he may have mentioned that would explain circumstances.
Good luck

How do I know whether or not my friend with ADHD is intentionally ghosting me or if it's just a symptom of their ADHD?
The only real way is to wait until your contact them again and ask. There aren’t any particular signs as to their behavior over whether they’ve ghosted or gotten distracted. The long it goes on, the more likely a ghosting is, but ADHD is a funny thing, sometimes as a sufferer you’ll suddenly have a thought one day that goes something like “My gosh! It’s been six months since I’ve talked to <insert name>! I thought it was just the other day. I’ll call them after a while for sure”, and then procrastinate on the call, or get distracted again and forget about their having remembered, how ever briefly. I’d also say it depends on how badly distractible and time-blind your friend is. The worse they are with those two symptoms, the more likely they are to have forgotten for a while.

How can you tell if a doctor is prescribing an addictive medication?
I have a pretty sure-fire way of detecting if the medication is addictive: Excuse me doctor, is this medication physically or psychologically addictive? It’s worked every time I’ve tried it. I haven’t had to ask it much, doctors are usually all over themselves to warn you if something is addictive. It also helps to remember that being dependent on a drug for whatever reason isn’t necessarily addiction. Addiction comes in when you develop physical dependence, have discontinuation syndrome on stopping it and you exhibit seeking behavior. So a dependence on a psychological medicine of some type usually is not addiction. You can also be dependent on a narcotic and not be addicted. It depends on the person, the medication, and the circumstances. A quick and dirty way to screen for addiction is ask…

The amount of parachute material goes up with the square of the radius of the parachute, which adds weight and packing volume to the parachute.
I would imagine that just adding more than a few feet in diameter would require a partial or even complete redesign if they changed the parachute very much. Then they have to account for the change in packed size and weight, how multiple parachute packs are packed into a given volume, I can imagine all day the little things that might have to change or be adjusted for a minor (not from the jumper’s POV!) adjustment in the design.
I’ve also noticed that once the military finds a way that works, they don’t like to change it.
I don’t think the cost comes in at all, really, but the time and effort “cost” of doing something differently and accounting for all the subtle follow-on effects might be higher than we think from an initial assessment.

Can a psychiatrist refuse to prescribe me 30 mg of Adderall twice a day for my ADHD if I have been prescribed it before for 10 years?
A doctor is responsible for what happens when they prescribe any medication for you, and as a result their prescription decisions are final within their practice. Nobody can tell a doctor what to prescribe if they don’t want to. You have two choices, change doctors, which might get you labeled as a medication-seeker, or talk to the doctor first and find out Why he won’t prescribe it to you. Many doctors these days seem to have gotten wary of people that show up asking for adderall. Some of them will prescribe only to long-term patients of theirs, or may require drug testing to make sure you are taking it and not diverting it, as well as not using street drugs, and still others flatly refuse to have anything to do with it at all.

They have the normal range of IQs either way. ADHD doesn’t directly affect the IQ scores other than some people have trouble concentrating on the test and do worse than they would without.

One thing you can do is take a small area that has to be passed for him to leave the house.

You’re an adult now, it’s entirely up to you if you get rescreened. ADHD isn’t something you really test negative for, you just fail to meet the criteria. ADHD is a constellation of related symptoms, if you have enough of the major symptoms AND they have a significantly negative impact on your life, your ability to function, then you might be judged to have ADHD. Typically a doctor, generally a psychiatrist but sometimes another type, or a psychologist, can do the screening. The best screening will involve people that know you. They’ll generally be asked to fill out basic form about what kind of symptoms they see in your and how impairing it seems to them. Then the doctor takes that information and along with a careful interview they will asses which symptoms you have. After that it’s a matt…

What foods should be avoided if you have erratic blood sugar levels?
Foods with a high glycemic index, for starters. High glycemic index foods tend to be carbohydrates that digest very quickly and can often produce large spike in blood sugar even after only having a modest amount. Sugars, starches, things like that are high index foods, as are many fruits. Eating more protein and fat along in meals slows down the absorption of carbohydrates and helps keeps a more even blood sugar level, and the proteins digest more slowly and absorb over a longer time than the carbohydrates, and the fats digest even more slowly and provide a good solid base level for a long time. Eating these very regularly, along with appropriate snacks during the day to support the blood sugars between meals can, and usually will, go a considerable way towards taming erratic blood sugars.

How can you tell if your ideas are based on intuition or logic?
That’s actually a much easier question than it sounds.
If you can explain your idea clearly from beginning to end in actual words (not just thinking it) and include the why of the idea, then it’s very likely to be logic. If it’s intuition, you’re going to run across certain telltale words like “I feel”, “I believe”, “I suspect that “, “it seems to me” and other similar “fuzzy” phrases.

Can someone have both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder, or are they both different disorders entirely? If so, how does that manifest in the individual's behavior?
Bipolar disorder and ADHD are indeed very different disorders, but interestingly enough people have both at a rate that exceeds random chance. I do not know if there is an environmental or epigenetic component or not. Both disorders are functions of many different genes, some not very related to each other, and the research for what genes are involved is ongoing. I strongly suspect there is some overlap in the genes involved in Bipolar and ADHD, which is why there is a higher level of comorbidity with them than would otherwise be expected. Sadly, I have no proof of this, from what I have seen in various posts and read about in some papers the research current and still ongoing, so maybe we’ll have some results in that area. Just knowing which genes are involved might give clues as to new the…

Why don't ADHD people just take L-DOPA instead of amphetamines to increase dopamine?
Mostly because there seems to be much more involved in ADHD than just dopamine. Chalking all of ADHD up to a dopamine deficiency is too simplistic of a view, there is a whole constellation of things that have to happen for nerve impulses to move correctly. Dopamine is a very important one, but not the only one.

For people with ADHD, does medication help with focus or is it more effective for managing impulsivity/hyperactivity?
For me it’s both. It helps a great deal with my impulsiveness, but it doesn’t get rid of it, it’s still up to me to keep a foot on my tendency to interrupt or do something without thinking. I’ve cultivated the habit of thinking before I do something, sometimes I actually do think first, and I do that even better now that I’m medicated. It’s still a challenge, but I’m much more likely now to think first than before. My medication helps wonderfully with my difficulties with focus. Unfortunately it is not focus-in-a-bottle, but it helps me make myself focus on something I’m not that interested in, at least for a while. I don’t know how to quantify that other than it “improves” my ability to focus some attention. I’ve never objectively measured the increase in my attention span, but it’s defini…

I went to one fairly prestigious university and also a highly regarded private college while I was going to college. At the private college I got by reasonably okay because I was isolated way up in the mountains of North Georgia and there was very little to distract me other than the spectacular scenery. At the more prestigious university I did okay to a point, but I was so massively irritated by the attitudes of so many of the other students that I just couldn’t see myself staying as a student there while entirely avoiding all campus activities.
The way it felt was very challenging and a bit exhilarating at times. In the subjects in which I do well, I did very well and after high school it felt like I was flying. Unfortunately there are always those core classes that everyone must take, and those were intimidating before I even went to the classes because I knew that they would be as rigorous as the other classes but on subjects that I couldn’t fake an interest in. I left the University before that became an issue. I felt like I was running away, but I did manage to leave with my GPA intact. At the college I squeaked by enough to almost get my Associates degree, but I missed 1 PE class (1 measly credit hour) and to get that class I would have to attend again the next fall, and that would have put me out of synch with where I was going, so I didn’t take the class and get my A.S. Major mistake there, so add regret to the feelings of going to really nice schools.

How does it feel being a student with ADHD?
When I was in grade school and I had been first diagnosed as Hyperactive, as it was called at the time, it gave me a small understanding of why I couldn’t sit still and I was always getting angry at people when I couldn’t monopolize a conversation. I was plenty smart, I had zero issues with schoolwork at that time. Once I moved into high school, the situation quickly became desperate. I had never learned anything about how to study, both because I couldn’t sit still long enough to concentrate and even when I managed to force myself to sit still (briefly) I still couldn’t concentrate.

Whether or not Wellbutrin works better than Ritalin for ADHD entirely depends on the person and their individual biochemistry and presentation of symptoms. There is not a definitive answer for this question.

Can ADD be treated in one’s 60s?
Yes, ADHD can be treated in one’s 60s! I’m 59 and being treated for it with no issues caused by the treatment. There may be individual medical issues that shape any treatment involving prescriptions, but that’s true to some extent for everyone. As an example, if you’re a heart patient or have high blood pressure that’s not adequately controlled, that might limit or even preclude the usage or influence the dosage of stimulant medications, depending on your medical details. Stimulants, though they have the highest visibility of the medications used to tread ADHD, are not the only ones available.

Being different and distinct from each other, they behave very differently in the body and accomplish their tasks in several different ways.

The appearance of the red to blue change after the initial stages of ballot counting is also because in many cases Republican-dominated legislatures have set election rules that require absentee and other mail-in ballots to not be counted until after the close of polls. This necessarily allows the in-person voting to be counted electronically before then mail-in ballots are tallied. Since Democrats tend to use mail-in voting more than Republicans, this leads to the appearance of an initial red surge, followed by a blue surge, both of which are artifacts of how and when votes are tallied and typical voting patterns among the parties and absolutely not because of any wide-spread cheating.

Is taking a stimulant for add/ADHD dangerous in the long term?
Stimulants aren’t necessarily dangerous in the long term as long as you follow your doctor’s advice and don’t play with your dosages on your own. Every stimulant used in ADHD has a safe level of use that varies from medication to medication, and above those doses side effects may occur. Everyone also has an appropriate level of medication that is best for them and sometimes a person will not tolerate a normally safe maximum dose very well. Also, with some medications, you might need more than the safe dose to get the desired outcome, in which case the doctors will try you on a different medication or maybe a blend of medications. Doctors are loathe to prescribe more than the published safe therapeutic levels and likely will not, preferring to try something else. Going above those safe level…

What is the long-term outlook for people with ADHD who don't medicate for it in childhood?
The long-term outlook for children who aren’t medicated for their ADHD is entirely different from person to person. There is no universal answer, it’s always an individual case, very few people with ADHD are the same in their ADHD symptoms and reaction to medications, so there can’t be a much of a general rule of thumb. Part of this depends both on how severe their ADHD symptoms are and which ADHD symptoms they have. ADHD is on a spectrum of issues from minor to severe. Most people are in between the extremes, not that many are outliers. I would suspect it’s sort of a bell curve distribution, but I can’t be sure of that. People with milder forms of ADHD will be much more likely to be academically successful as children even without medication. As the severity of the symptoms increase the util…

What is the difference between an IQ score and being considered as gifted academically or intellectually in general? If there is no difference, then why are separate tests given for both of them?
The short answer is that IQ is just potential, nothing more. It doesn’t say anything about accomplishment or even ability, though the shorter IQ tests do tend to be heavy on general knowledge questions. There are plenty of people in what some might consider “the lower occupations” with plenty of IQ to burn, and some people that have done very well with an average or even less than average IQ with hard work and dedication. IQ also entirely ignores a person’s drive to succeed, and what they want to do with their life. It is a poor predictor of outcome, though it’s more useful in the hands of an expert. Two of the most academically successful people I know are only slightly above average in IQ, and I know plenty of people in the 130+ category who aren’t anywhere near as successful as they wan…

Are there any specific challenges that need to be considered when developing online training courses?
This is a short answer, but the training metrics are often overlooked or poorly planned for. Unless it’s a one-off course, you need to find some way to judge how much your class participants know ahead of time and you need to know how well they learned the material and get feedback from them on the class. Without that you have no way to judge how well the class achieved it’s objectives, and you wouldn’t know what needs to either be improved or streamlined. You do have the objectives clearly written and defined, don’t you? If not, you need to attend to that too. The easiest way to do these assessments is to design a pre-evaluation and a post-evaluation, and usually either a section for opinions, or ideally a section to have the participants rate the teacher, if there is one, and the course co…

How long does it take to see the effect of methylphenidate (like Concerta), days, weeks, or months?
Methylphenidate is a fast-acting medication, unlike SSRIs and other anti-depressive medication that take a very long time to take effect. Methylphenidate usually takes effect within an hour of the first dose, and depending on the formulation (time-release vs immediate-release) it can last from four hours or so to most of the day (12-ish hours). When a doctor first starts you on a drug like this, they generally start with the lowest dose and then gradually increase the dose over time until they find the right dose. Methylphenidate is not body weight-related, it’s strictly an individual sensitivity type thing. Some people do perfectly well with a low dose, others need a higher dose, and it doesn’t work for every individual. Higher dose does not necessarily work better than a lower does does,…

Yes, it’s quite possible to have had undiagnosed ADHD and still have done well academically. Having ADHD doesn’t necessarily spell doom for academic performance, particularly if it’s on the milder end of things. Putting forth enough effort to overcome your obstacles is one way to overcome the handicap that ADHD places in your way, having a good memory is another, and so is natural intelligence. I would assume that natural aptitude for the subjects involved would also be of great benefit.

First, a bit of a correction. ADD is the older term for what is now called ADHD. Anyone can have ADHD regardless of their intelligence level. ADHD is not a weakness or failure of intelligence at all. If I had to classify it, I’d classify it as a learning disorder, though it’s much more for many people. Just because someone has ADHD doesn’t mean they can’t accomplish things, they just have to work harder and differently then the neurotypicals. ADHD people have problems with directing concentration when and where they want, but medication and lifestyle changes can go a really long way towards achieving what they wish to.

If you raise the punishments to draconian levels that tends to 1) incentivize criminals to make sure that they leave no witnesses, even to relatively minor crimes and 2) by cutting the casual criminal out of the loop you increase the involvement of the big-time guys, the mafia, cartels, gangs and the like.
The USA has tried several times in the past to massively increase punishments, often to little end. With the three strikes laws you had an increase in murders from people who might be up for their third strike. Once someone is already looking at life in prison, what else are you going to do to them? Execute them? Even a death penalty usually takes decades before it’s enforced, and the most common causes of leaving death row is exoneration, death due to illnesses, and death due to old age.

When they first approached him to do the narration he reminded them that he mostly did horror and they probably didn’t really want him, but they assured him that he was precisely the voice they wanted. His voice really adds to the feel of the show in my estimation.

Leaving aside actual problems with reading itself, distractibility seems to be a major part of reading difficulties with many people. When you are highly distractible, any little thing can derail trying to read, be it the chair isn’t comfortable, your clothes might not be sitting just right, you feel the book is too heavy, just about anything low level.

What is the worst ADHD attack you have had?
I’ve never heard it put that way, and ADHD isn’t a sudden-onset problem. You’re not moving happily along and then all of a sudden your ADHD kicks in, or you just suddenly have a spell of inattention. I think it’s important for people to know that. I’ve certainly had my episodes of severe inattention with consequences, though.

What are the effects of attention deficit disorder (ADD/ADHD) on a person's ability to sleep?
I’ve noticed that the biggest problem most people have while trying to get to sleep while having ADHD is trying to shut down the those racing thoughts. When you try to relax, it seems like your mind sets about wandering around and thinking about anything and everything instead of winding on down to go to sleep. It might be your schedule tomorrow, what happened on the playground when you were a child, news you’ve heard about recently, or something totally out of left field. You can find yourself in the most bizarre train of thought without trying and that can really occupy some people and turn into insomnia. What I’ve decided to add to this is is: “What to do when your mind won’t be quiet and you want to sleep.” I learned a trick from another ADHDer years and years ago, around the early 2000’s…

Can an optometrist diagnose attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or autism?
Exactly what qualifications of a optometrist would inform their diagnosis? Do they diagnose other things too, like Bipolar or Influenza or Strep infections?
The only way this wouldn’t be a absolute flat no is if they also happened to be trained as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or specialty medical personnel trained in the diagnosis of ADHD. Otherwise, that is a flat no on that.
If an optometrist claims to be able to professionally diagnose ADHD or anything like that, whether or not to report them to the state medical board is up to you, but I would suggest that you do.
The question was: Can an optometrist diagnose attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or autism.

Do adults with hoarding disorder who discover they have ADHD resolve the hoarding when they go on ADHD medication?
Only sometimes does ADHD really affect hoarding, and those times it’s more of a contributing factor and not a cause. Going on ADHD medication really helps with eliminating that contribution to hoarding and can help even turn ADHD into an ally of getting away from hoarding. Hoarding itself is usually more of a symptom of OCD or of Anxiety. I don’t personally understand the mechanism of the OCD type of hoarding other than some people simply have the impulse to keep things and the OCD keeps it going and going until suddenly it’s out of hand and very, very difficult to change. I think those are the people that you tend to see on the TV shows that depict hoarders, although I’ve noticed they all have anxiety and indecision when it comes to choosing what stays and goes.

Oh yes that kind of derailed thought is familiar to me. With me it wanders widely through all sorts of strange connections. I understand that it happens to regular people sometimes too, but with me at least it seems to be nearly continuous if I’m not engaged in something else, sort of like an engine idling. My mind just sits there and spins and sometimes goes in some really odd directions.

As far as “normal”, I don’t know. In the past I’ve found myself feeling that way on occasion while I was unmedicated.

Do you feel you could be better adapted to some circumstance with them? Or maybe more capable of extended attention?

How can you tell the difference between an auditory processing disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a child who simply doesn't like school?
The easiest and most accurate way to distinguish between auditory processing disorder, ADHD, and someone who just doesn’t like school is to get an accurate diagnosis from a professional who deals with such things.
By the time a layman has tried to deal with all the overlapping symptoms of the two disorders, you still have to contend with the fact that many children with one or both of the aforementioned disorders often don’t like school much either because of their difficulties with performing well.

Should I change the Wellbutrin or Should I wait? First times I noticed an increase in focus (a little bit). Dreams fill me up creativity but I have no energy for any action last 3 days. WB doesn’t satisfy about observing according to Ritalin.
Yes, you definitely should wait a while. Wellbutrin isn’t an immediate-effect type medication, it generally takes a month or so to fully kick in and it’s long lasting, i.e. it doesn’t run out after a few hours. That has to do with the way it works. Stimulant type ADHD medications work by enhancing the activity of the executive functions of the brain, generally yielding better attention and impulse control. Wellbutrin is a a SSNRI, a Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor, which works by letting the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine dwell a bit longer in the synapses and in this way increases the strength of their signals without using a stimulant. Since it takes a while to kick in, your dose may be titrated upwards for a while until you find the correct dose o…

How does someone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) feel when they take their medication? Do they notice a difference in how they feel, or does it just seem like nothing has changed?
This is one of those “it depends” type questions. Sometimes when you take a ADHD medication after you’re already trying to focus on something you can notice how it starts taking effect after a half-hour or so, depending on the medication and it’s formulation. Immediate release formulations are more like this than the extended release ones, and some medications work over a longer period of time and there is such a slow onset of the effects that it can’t really be noticed. At times when I’ve just changed medicines, say Adderall to Ritalin, I’ve gotten a mild sensation of a … I guess I would have to say alertness and a kind of coolness, like a slightly cooler draft of air, and I can just feel the focus kick in.

Why can't people with ADHD think before doing anything?
Not thinking before doing is one of the primary symptoms of ADHD. It’s called impulsivity. Part of the brain has the job of coordinating and overseeing actions and behaviors. It’s called Executive Function. The problem is that in people with ADHD, that part of the brain takes a tad longer to kick in that it does to go ahead and follow through on an impulse. The effect varies quite a bit from person to person, it can be a very major problem with some people and not so major or even barely present in others. In my particular case I have a lot of trouble with impulsivity when I’m not medicated. I’ll reflexively buy things that look interesting, say the first thing that comes to mind, or to a much lesser extent perform some action on impulse, though that actual acting without thinking part has g…

What are some reliable and valid online tests for diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? If so, how do they work?
This will be a really short answer.
There aren’t any. A diagnosis of ADHD needs to be performed by someone, usually a Psychologist or Psychiatrist but sometimes other practitioners who have been appropriately trained, who can interview you and ask interactive questions, observe you, and find out about your past. No online test can do that.
Part of the diagnosis is that there is a rather large list of possible symptoms, and to be properly diagnosed you have to meet the criteria of a certain number of those symptoms. Nobody fits all symptoms that I have ever heard of.
As I hope you can see, this is not a job a computer program can do reliably, especially a free online one.

What tips are there to help a person with bipolar II , ADHD and depression to live a normal life?
Depression is part and parcel of being Bipolar II. In fact I’ve noticed that Bipolar II often tends to lean on the side of depression with hypomania being less common. Sometimes there isn’t much room between Bipolar II and Cyclothymia, the main difference being that to be Bipolar II you have to have had at least one hypomanic episode at some point. Some Bipolar II people have very rare hypomania, some are more split. The best thing you can do for Bipolar II is to take your medication, without fail. It’s very easy to trick yourself into thinking that you’ve felt fine for a long time now, I must not need it any more. The reason you tend to feel fine and either are not cycling or slightly cycling is because of that medication. And if you do head into a depressive episode, that same medication…

(I am unmedicated and the diagnosis is recent so I am just trying to identify symptoms in hopes that I can get relief from some of this stuff with the help of medication. Any help/advice/ etc is appreciated.)
Question: Does anyone ever feel like they are trying to schedule their day (let's say in the mornings) and they can never actually find their ""starting point""? So much so that you'll end up putting off everything for that day all because you never could figure out where to start. Does this ever affect anyone else?
Oh yes, that sounds very familiar! And not just in the mornings, either. When I start in on a major task or set of tasks I often get paralyzed by all the possible starting points. In the past I used to try and reason out which would be either the most logical starting point, or the most efficient. I could get quite engaged in this exercise, engaged to the point where I would end up contemplating the best possible way to get started and during all that I wasn’t accomplishing anything at all. My mom calls it Paralysis by Analysis. So now I’ll do one of two things. My preferred way to get started is to decide during my planning phase where I’ll start.

What are some possible explanations for why people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to be risk-takers?
What explanation for why we tend to be risk takers? The canonical answer is inhibited executive function that doesn’t give the brain enough time to think about results before the execution of the impulse takes place. Not all ADHD people are this way though there is a distinct tendency in that direction. Some of us are more hyperactive, some are more inattentive, and some are more impulsive. I was all three in one package. Skip down to the bottom if you want. Personal examples follow. I had a terrible, terrible time as a child, being both hyperactive and very impulsive.

Is taking an IQ test worth it for a 14-year-old?
Whether or not it’s worth it depends on what you hope to accomplish with the information. Taking a real IQ test, not one of the fake online tests, is a bit of an undertaking. The shortest one I’ve seen done took about 30 minutes with a good practitioner and a quick student. It’s a significant effort and it will only give you a moment-in-time snapshot of how you were doing that day. A more thorough test will take considerably longer and involve many different types of reasoning to give a more comprehensive score. My first one was because I was being diagnosed, at 9 years old, for either learning difficulties or being low on the scale. As it turned out, I was pretty smart and had a major case of ADHD. So that test helped them zero in on a diagnosis. Another time I took one was because I had go…

Exactly zero.
IQ is a measure of overall mental acuity, measured by a test at a specific time and condition. The chances are strong that if you take the test 3 weeks running you will get 3 different scores, though somewhat related if it’s a good test.
Modafinil is a stimulant that can help someone with ADHD with their executive function. It can help them better apply themselves, pay better attention, tend to have an easier time with short-term memory. In no fashion can modafinil increase IQ, I can’t even imagine how that could work.

There was a lot of research on this done in the 60’s and 70’s. The basic upshot of all of it is with enough willpower you can stay awake for up to a week, but after your usual waking period you will experience a steady decline in your mental abilities, especially your judgement and abstract reasoning, and over a couple of days you will start having hallucinations that will get more and more difficult to tell from reality. I read about some D.J. that stayed up for a whole week and he was pretty much just babbling at the end, made almost no sense at all. Most people can tolerate a little extra wakefulness, but they will still decline, usually pretty quickly. The amount that someone can do this depends very much on their physical shape and general health and energy. Teenagers, though they have…

Does having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) make a person automatically eligible for disability benefits?
No. Not in the US for Social Security Disability benefits. In the US, you have to be found to be unable to hold down any job on a rather complete list. The explanation given when I read up on disability back in the mid 2000’s was if you can sit in a restaurant and roll napkins around silverware, you won’t qualify for disability. Getting disability benefits means that for mental and/or physical reasons, you are not capable of holding a job, even with reasonable accommodations. It doesn’t have to be available jobs in your area either, just the ability to hold a job in the catalog will disqualify you. Disability is usually judged on the basis of complete an inability, despite a desire to do so, to be able to be employable. That can be either one overriding thing, like a severe developmental disa…

How do you get a prescription for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from Kaiser Permanente?
Ooh! Ooh! I can answer this one! Call your Behavioral Health department, tell them that you think you have ADHD and would like an appointment for an evaluation, or alternately if you’ve been diagnosed before tell them that and you’ll still get an appoint for evaluation. They will get you that appointment and evaluate you to see if you have ADHD and/or how severe it is. If it takes a while to get in, don’t feel put off, initial diagnoses can be a bit involved and the BH group is always under time pressure. It was very easy for me, when I went in for my evaluation I just acted like myself and it was a pretty short interview because I’m very obvious in my symptoms if you know how to look. I was diagnosed for the first time a very long time ago and in my particular case it was mostly a formality…

How long does it take for someone with bipolar disorder to notice that they are manic when they stop taking their medications?
It varies a great deal from person to person and between degrees of mania. If mania leads to psychosis as it sometimes can, they’re generally aware of the situation but may either be unable or unwilling to do anything about it. In the milder forms of mania the person often feels very good, “on top of the world” and many times won’t even believe that anything is wrong, “how could something be wrong when I feel so good?” That second feeling with medium to mild mania is part of why it can be be difficult to keep some bipolar people on their medication regimen. During normal times they feel just fine and some wonder why take medication when I’m feeling fine?

Does a lack of exercise in school lead to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) later in life? If so, why?
Not at all. The only connection between ADHD and exercise is that exercise can assist some people who already have ADHD. There is no cause-effect relationship for failure to exercise and ADHD, which is a developmental neurological condition nearly always present from birth and often inherited.

What ways can teachers and aides help an ADHD student be calmer in the classroom?
The question I was asked was what ways can teachers and aides help an ADHD student be calmer in the classroom. At the time I was in college it was generally “understood” that people outgrew ADHD, so practitioners didn’t prescribe ritalin and the like for ADHD in adults. If the practitioners had understood how ADHD actually works, medication might have been more available and things might have been very different for me and many others in my general cohort. For me, the biggest single issue I had in class was the distractions from the other students. Maintaining control of the class is one of the things that would have made a very large difference for me. All the cross-talk and side discussions is one of the things that sunk my attention in college. Too much stimulation made me nervous, which…

Driving and ADHD

· 2y
Can you drive while taking ADHD medication?
Normally, driving while on your routine ADHD medication is a good idea. As a matter of fact I feel like I’m doing a disservice to myself and other drivers if I go on the road without my medication. When I’m medicated I’m far more attentive to the road and other drivers around me and things that are likely to cause issues, such as the light changing way up ahead or a train going towards an intersection ahead, before they are issues. The only time I’d really recommend against driving on your medications is when you start taking them for the first time or if you change to a medication you haven’t tried before, just to make sure it doesn’t affect you in an unexpected way. My little personal metric is that I should be able to know where other drivers are in the 8-point box* around my vehicle, without having to double-check, because of my ongoing knowledge of conditions and my regular monitoring of my surroundings. If I get a surprise I may have a problem reacting to it quickly enough. That slightly slowed executive functioning can sometimes cause an issue during sudden surprised on the road. As you get older and your reflexive reactions get better ingrained you can relax that a little bit because your brain and reflexes usually already know what to do in X situation. Older as in around 30, after your executive areas in your brain have fully matured and gained experience. Remember, especially if you’re the impulsive sort but everyone really, you’re not as good of a driver as you likely think you are. Most people think they’re in the top 10% drivers. Obviously that’s not so. Please remember, when you drive you are taking other people’s lives into your hands so, if you are having an off ADHD day or something, consider getting a ride if reasonable. Driving while distracted is not good. I normally can’t hold a conversation in tricky traffic and if it gets bad, off goes the radio. That drives a couple of my neurotypical friends nuts when I do that, but I don’t have moving. I stopped driving for a bit of time a while back because of another medication I had to start taking exacerbated my ADHD and I felt I owed it to the other drivers not to risk them until I knew I was good to go. *8-point Box. Dead ahead, dead behind, directly left, directly right, right-front corner, left-front corner, right-rear corner and left-rear corner. If you don’t always know what’s in those spots, you’re not paying enough attention.

Do people with attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) like background noise while they work or study? If so, why does it help them focus better than silence?
I like to have brown noise playing at a low to low-medium level when I’m having problems with distractibility. Not only do I find it soothing, but it masks many of the distracting low-level sounds that would normally really tend to disturb my attention. This works even better when my anxiety is causing issues because my mind has less randomly varying input to try and process in the background. I’ve also discovered that it can help me get to sleep more easily for much the same reasons.

Why is it hard for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to stay motivated? What can they do about this problem if anything at all?
It’s hard to stay motivated precisely because your attention over time is impaired. That doesn’t mean it’s non-existent, just not working at full capacity. Your mind is also geared more towards immediate satisfaction, the promise of working for a longer time to then derive some satisfaction is a very difficult concept to carry out for people with ADHD. What works (often) for me is to start taking a task apart into sub-tasks. In an ideal situation, you can break a project or plan down into individual segments that might take 10 to 15 minutes to complete, tops. I shoot for about 5 minutes if it’s a difficult or particularly long task or if I’m having a issue that day with motivation. Break things down as far as you feel you need to.

Yes, there are a number of adaptations, behaviors, methods and medications that can help. Exactly what you do depends on the specific problems you are having with it. The overall goal is to counteract your tendencies with behaviors and adaptations that most benefit you in particular.

What is the relationship between IQ test scores and ADD/ADHD symptoms?
Everything I’ve read has led me to believe that ADHD is spread equally throughout the normal range of IQ scores. With what I’ve also read and my sense of how things tend to work with ADHD, I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that ADHD doesn’t appear to follow the IQ spectrum all that well because one thing that is necessary to measure IQ also has the side effect of measuring attention. What I suspect is that people who can or do manage their ADHD better than others score higher on the IQ tests, about where they would normally score, and those that can’t get control of it as well do worse than their actual intelligence would suggest. I think that the net effect would be a mild lowering of IQ scores across the range and I would also think that it would distort the bell curve by shifting the c…

Some people really like audiobooks. That wouldn’t work for me because I have a bit of a audio-processing issue which actually makes audiobooks harder for me than regular reading.

Can an adult be diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) if they don't show any hyperactive symptoms?
You certainly can be. ADHD is a constellation of symptoms, not everyone will have all of them. Most people don’t have all of them as a matter of fact. There is a book called the DSM, I forget which version they’re on these days. But it lists out a great many behaviors and problems that might be ADHD-related, and the diagnostician will see how many of the symptoms are present in the person being diagnosed. I believe, but I’m not super-sure, that some few symptoms must be present, and many other symptoms tend to confirm and define the sub-type that a person has.

If the psychiatrist believes it to be necessary, yes. Expect a thorough diagnosis and examination of the type of problems that you are having, with input from people who know if at all possible. Their extra input can really shed some light on what is going on as far as your adaptation to ADHD and it’s issues. Then the psychiatrist will decided, maybe with your input, which medication to start with.

As a direct answer:

More fleshed out:
If it’s in your medical record and they receive a copy from the other doctor’s office I don’t see why not, unless for some reason the doctor thinks you’re trying to score stimulant medications or it’s contraindicated for some reason. Apparently there are some doctors out there now that won’t prescribe them to anyone at all, regardless of diagnosis and who performed it. I don’t know any doctors that don’t have a long pre-existing relationship with a patient who would prescribe the medication like that without either performing that diagnosis themselves or seeing a referral.

As a person with ADHD, I feel greedy whenever I try to purchase something online (especially an app). How should I handle this?

I have a lot of problems going to some sites because I want to buy this… and this… and that… and so and so… ad infinitum. One thing I’ve started doing is using PayPal, because that interposes an extra confirmation layer between me and the merchant. It’s almost like an “are you sure” sign for me.

Has anyone been prescribed dexamfetamine for ADHD and become really sleepy almost zombie like on a really small dose? Did you change to a different one that worked better?
While idiosyncratic reactions to medications are not unusual, I’m surprised that the dexamphetamine is making you sleepy. Amphetamine is what’s colloquially known as an “upper”, or stimulant. A very small dose shouldn’t make you sleepy at all, if anything it might perk you up a little, though at a very low dosage I wouldn’t expect much in the way of a reaction at all.
You should talk with your provider about your medication issues, it could be you’re just tired and need some rest, or it could be you need a larger dose, or it could be that you need a different medication entirely.

Do children on medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often cry when they don't get their way?
That depends on a couple of things. How frustrated or irritated is the child? Do they tend to cry easily? The medication can help a lot with frustration, but it doesn’t make it go away. The hard part is figuring out why they might be crying. I remember being little and sometimes being so, so frustrated by things not working out the way I tried or planned, and my parents often chalked it up to being upset I didn’t get my way when it was usually much more complex than that. And that would really irritate me to no end, it felt like I wasn’t being listened to or ought right dismissed.

What’s the best fiber to take with Adderall and Vyvanse?
Just off the cuff here, I’d suggest not taking the fiber with your medications, take them at a different time of day. Fiber can absorb medications and slow down their release or even keep some of it from being absorbed, which is pretty much the opposite of what you want when you take medications. The best fiber is the fiber that you’re willing to take! Make sure to get a mix of soluble and insoluble fiber, they work differently in the system though towards the same general end.

Yes, that is entirely possible, for a few different reasons. Having ADHD does not guarantee failure at all. It comes in different types and intensities.

If you are a mild sufferer, you may have developed sufficient coping strategies on your own to become quite successful. It is not unusual for people to be diagnosed later in life (30s, 40s, 50s) and realize that the diagnosis explains some persistent difficulties they’ve had but overcome, or that have nagged them but not enough to seriously impact their success, or that they’ve managed to succeed despite all the issues.

I don’t broadcast it to everyone, basically it’s not particularly their business and they don’t need to know, unless they can either learn from me or need to know for personal or business reasons. I don’t mind people knowing though. When I was 9 and I was first diagnosed with ADHD, my entire family was immediately informed and they came together to try and assist me as I grew up. I was quite lucky in that respect. Being 30, that wouldn’t apply. I don’t hide it and I really don’t care if someone believes in it or not, that’s their personal issue. I don’t use it as an excuse for anything. It is simply a facet of who I am but it doesn’t define me. Like I don’t just tell people I’m an introvert or that I like books either.

Is it a symptom of ADHD if I am unable to concentrate in a mildly noisy place like a classroom? I often read a sentence but doesn't understand anything I've just read.
It’s certainly a problem with someone with ADHD would have, but so might many other people. One symptom doesn’t mean you have ADHD.
ADHD is a whole constellation of symptoms, not all of which are necessarily present in any individual, but a certain number of them do have to be present to be diagnosed.
Impulsivity, hyperactivity, disorganization, various issues with concentration and several other items are all common symptoms. If you have any questions about maybe having ADHD, look into a counsellor, doctor, or other professional for a diagnosis.

How do I trick my ADHD brain into doing what I want in life like working without distraction, reviewing/studying for a board exam, and not being blind in time?
Basically, you can’t. If you could it wouldn’t be ADHD! ADHD is an inherent part of our nature, something that you can learn to cope with, but cannot simply “trick” away. What you can do is learn coping skills of various sorts. Some are psychological in nature, as in learning various thought patterns to avoid and to promote. Self-care is very important, staying in shape, tending to your diet, getting enough sleep and exercise, meditation, things like that. Some are more supportive in nature, like taking notes, using schedules, using alarms and timers and such. Others are more supplement related, such as medications and perhaps nootropics if you’re so inclined. Others are more sociological, as in getting your friends to help you adapt, educate them that when you need time to do something imp…

I read that most ADHD people like playing video games, but I am an ADHD person and I find too much difficulty almost liking any video game. Why is this the case?
I doubt there is a simple answer as to why you don’t get into video games. You’re not alone in this though, I have a thorough dislike of most video games. To me, the majority of them just aren’t fun. All of the following is just my opinion and conjecture, I don’t have any facts or research to back it up. I think what makes or breaks games to me come down to a three or so factors. One factor is how many different inputs you have to deal with at any one time and how often those inputs change. One RPG I was playing for a while (poorly) was extremely position-sensitive, precisely which square you were standing on would affect almost anything you did and if you didn’t stand on the correct square sometimes you couldn’t even have a shot at hitting the boss.

Can memory improve with age for people with ADHD?
Can memory improve as you age? With training and practice, yes, but it won’t improve just because you’re aging. I can see how it might appear to be improving if your baseline is as a hyperactive child or teenager and the hyperactivity dies down over the years, yielding less distraction for memory tasks. Medication, usually with stimulants but not restricted to them, can definitely enhance memory over your natural baseline. These is also the use of nootropics, which also include several medications, which can improve memory performance among other things. As far as I am concerned practicing and exercising your memory is the best way to improve it. I used to have a job that involved my getting a person’s employee number at the beginning of a call.

Does ritalin make adults gain weight?
I’ve not heard of someone gaining weight on ritalin. Since ritalin, chemically known as methylphenidate, is a type of amphetamine, a stimulant, it tends to have a mild effect going the other way, particularly in the larger range of doses. It has a mild (in most people) tendency to suppress appetite, but I wouldn’t count on it to lose weight.
I cannot categorically say it won’t make adults gain weight, but I’ve never heard of that happening and I don’t see a way it could happen.

I have witnessed that most kids and teenagers with ADHD don't think realistically or logically. What are the symptoms of ADHD and the factors that create this problem?
To start with, let us say “many” instead of most. Teenagers already have the tendency to not think realistically or logically for many different reasons. Many of them can indeed think both realistically and/or logically, it depends on the individual. One of the non-ADHD items that can cause scattered type thinking is hormones. I remember being that age quite clearly and the pressures largely brought on by age and hormones were enormous, big enough that many times I thought I might not survive them. So many new thoughts, so many new urges, and no clue how to keep them from ruling over me. At the same time, the adolescent brain is developing at a rapid pace as it begins to move into it’s final adult form. Scattered thinking under that circumstance is both common and understandable.

How can a 15-year-old with ADHD be productive?

This comes with some baggage. You are likely in a school that teaches in a manner not the most conducive to your learning style. They tend to be regimented, very linear in their teaching, and expect a fairly high degree of organization from the student. I am assuming this in my following answer. Since you are in this situation, you will have to adapt to it more than you likely want to or maybe even feel like you can.

How quickly does it take to develop tolerance to dexamphetamine? I have been taking 5mg three times a day for 6 months. It feels like it’s not working as once it was.
Two things may be going on with your medication. One, you have actually developed a tolerance. If that is what’s happened, you need to look into ways to potentiate your medications effect on you. Look into nootropics. I’m very new to that topic as well, but search Quora and you will find a lot of posts on that subject and how it relates to ADHD. Another thing to try if you’re not already doing it is exercise. Exercise really helps promote various neurotransmitters (among other things) in your brain that can help with ADHD. Eat well, rest well. See your doctor about a dosage or medication change, it may well be time to do so. Two, you have adapted to the dosage and no longer actually “feel” the effects, but they’re probably still there. Stop and try to objectively look at your day. Is it like…

What is ""time blindness"" in people with ADHD?
Time blindness is a good description for the lack of a sense of passing time that many people with ADHD experience either most or all of the time. It is often a very pronounced effect. In my case, if I don’t have a clock I have little to no sense of what time it might be. I’ve started using a 24-hour clock because I also have issues with telling the difference between day or night without looking outside or checking the computer. My idea of duration is similarly deficient. To me a “short” time can be anything from a minute to an hour or so depending on what I’m doing. Often those can feel much like the same thing, unless I’m bored, in which case it’s an eternity.

I haven’t had the experience of being “bland/normal” with my medications.

Even with the people I know that seem to be adequately medicated, none of them have gotten “bland/normal”, whatever normal might be. They get more focused, more direct. They still have and exhibit ADHD symptoms but they have better control over the symptoms. The medication makes it easier to cope with the issues.

While I’d rather drink coffee, sometimes I just plain can’t drink enough. I have supplementary caffeine capsules that I use sometimes, 200mg each. I just take one at a time, but I’ll take them fairly close together if I’m having problems and I have to get something done, sometimes just an hour apart, though I shoot for 2 hours. If I don’t have anything special to do I’ll stick to coffee. But there definitely is an upper limit to daily caffeine intake, it can make a pretty good laxative! I suspect that level is very individual, though.
I’m already on Modafinil and Adderall, and even then I can easily sleep after I’m done doing what I needed done, but sometimes I’ll have pretty active dreams. My doctor is surprised that my blood pressure isn’t high as all heck, but it’s actually a bit below normal, go figure.
The downside of all the caffeine is the headaches from caffeine withdrawal if I don’t get enough in a day, but those 3 mugs of coffee in the morning seems to do a good job of that.

I wouldn’t say ineffective as much as caffeine seems to be better tolerated in people with ADHD. To me that suggests that more caffeine might be needed.
I know that in my case I’m not very sensitive to caffeine, it takes me about 3 big mugs of standard coffee in the morning to get going, or one mug of an artisan super coffee that I like. Great stuff but sort of thick :) Probably a total of 200–300 mg caffeine would be my guess, and more during the day to assist with my concentration.

In my case, I don’t play video games very often at all, I generally find them more frustrating than not.

Can caffeine make ADHD worse?
I find that coffee helps me concentrate much better than no coffee, but it takes a fair amount to get going. I’ve rarely found that too much coffee is a bad thing until I get into more that a pot of coffee every two hours or so. After that point I can get a bit jittery and impatient.
I take Adderall, 20mg twice daily, and it just isn’t enough help if serious concentration is needed for a particular task. Three or four decent mugs of coffee, on top of the Adderall can really help a lot. More than 3 mugs in a short time can exacerbate a mild tremor I have all the time, so that is a limit if fine dexterity is called for.
This doesn’t apply to everyone, I know some ADD people that are not coffee-tolerant at all. I suppose it just depends on the individual.

Make it a timed competition against yourself. Try to find some aspects of it you like and concentrate on those first.

If people with bipolar disorder go off their medication, do they get better?
Generally someone with Bipolar Disorder who goes off their medications will start cycling again and suddenly going off the medication can trigger anxiety or depression and kick off a cycle quite quickly. It also depends on the medication regimen that the patient is taking. Some are on fairly complex prescriptions and many times will stop taking prescriptions because they feel better and don’t like all the side-effects some of those medications can cause. That generally will lead to a relapse and having to get stabilized and then on maintenance medication all over again. Generally speaking, if a bipolar patient needs medication, their lives have been pretty rough before the medication and will often return to the way it was pre-medication.

Mr. Cruz and Mr. Graham are indeed hypocrites of the first order. I do not know if Graham ever retracted his comments, but I suspect he has not so as to avoid calling attention to them. He certainly disapproved of Trump while he was originally running for office, I recall him talking about how Trump could ruin the Republican party if elected, and that they would deserve it. Time has certainly showed him to be correct. Mr. Graham even spoke against Trump in the immediate post-1/6 acrimony, but it didn’t last very long at all once he saw how the wind was blowing.
I had originally respected Lindsay Graham some, pre-Trump. I didn’t like him much, but he seemed to be mostly on the level. His actions since Trump’s election have definitely showed him to be a spineless coward who will make any accommodation necessary to save his job as Senator.
To address your original comment, it is an open secret in Washington that Mr. Graham is homosexual. He’s been known to bring a male friend to gatherings where it’s traditional to bring one’s husband or wife. I’ve not really seen him (as far as I recall) move against LGBTQ rights, but he certainly courts the evangelical vote, and they are definitely no friends to the LGBTQ community.

I have chronic pain of a couple of different sorts and it really interferes with my ability to get to sleep. Once I’m out it isn’t so bad, it only wakes me up sometimes. I do suspect that it lessens the quality of my sleep. Chronic pain is a major stressor and activates all sorts of immune responses, including the inflammatory response, and those usually interfere with the quality of sleep, sometimes to the point of sleep being badly broken and not feeling rested at all.

Will getting extra sleep (sleeping earlier and for longer) help my ADHD brain?
Getting enough sleep is very important for coping with ADHD. Sleeping more than your body needs though won’t do anything much to help. Sleep is time to recuperate, rest, restore brain chemicals for the next day and recharge your body. As long as you wake up refreshed and alert, you pretty much have had enough sleep and adding to it won’t accomplish much if anything. People vary between about 6 hours and 10 or so hours for how much sleep their minds and bodies require. Sleeping beyond your basic requirement really only helps if your sleep has been low-quality. Something that I don’t think is paid nearly enough attention to is sleep quality. Six hours of good high-quality sleep beats 8 hours of low-quality sleep most of the time.

I immediately need to ask: which medications for which problem? My ADHD and GAD are not mutually exclusive, and neither are their medications. I am limited in how much ADHD medication (Adderall) I can take due to my GAD, and I take buspirone for the GAD, which in larger amounts makes me sleepy and a bit fuzzy. They work okay together MOST of the time, but not always. My medications working on some days and not other days is usually due to normal variability in my conditions. Some days are a good ADHD day, some days aren’t. Some days are good anxiety days, some aren’t. Sometimes they occur together, most times they don’t.

What is it like to attend college with ADHD? How understanding are professors and what accommodations did you receive?
When I was in college back in the early 80’s, it was not fun. It was before the AHA that provided for accommodations, so there was not a system in place to help people like me. I also was mildly physically handicapped, and only two buildings on campus were fully accessible to me without stairs. The ADHD alone could be brutal. Nothing was available to specifically address ADHD. No extra time, not allowed to record classes on a tape recorder for later review, no low-distraction spaces for tests, nothing. It didn’t help things at all that I had never had to study in elementary and high schools, things just seemed to come naturally as I have a good memory and great reading comprehension, though I always missed some things here and there. My high school GPA was wildly irregular, my mother could…

Why was I born with ADHD? I’ve been failing all my classes because of all of my stupid hyperfixations.
Why were you born with ADHD? That’s a nearly unanswerable question. There are a lot of things that can go into causing ADHD and none of them are really a single cause or anyone’s fault or doing. The most basic answer to your question is you have it because of luck of the draw. Things that go into causing ADHD are items such as genetics, development in the womb, possibly trauma from birth (controversial), environmental factors while you were developing before birth and after birth, and gene expression due to many different factors. If I left anything out it’s by accident, no deliberate omission. None of those things are under anyone’s control. As for myself, my mother says she knew something was up with me well before I was born because I was so incredibly physically hyperactive, and I was ver…

Can playing chess help improve concentration in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
Very short answer: yes, it can. But it’s not easy. The harder someone tries the more they will get out of it. I played chess starting at about age 8 with a friend of mine whose older brother was a local competition player, so he had been exposed young and was very good for his age. It was a really hard thing to do at first. My friend was much better than I at chess, but I took to the standard rules with no problem at all. My biggest problem was winning more than about 1% of the games, but I kept at it. The glorious thing about chess is that it is problems within problems. The next few moves in the game are a problem to be solved. The tactics involving those pieces are a slightly larger series of problems to solve. And the strategy of the whole game is a much larger problem to solve. It is ver…

How can you save an entire page as a PDF from within Chrome or any other browser?
There are two basic ways I know of to save an entire page as a PDF.
The first one is if your OS can save a print job as a PDF, many if not most can, and the ones that can’t could use various free programs to do so. In that case you simply print the page to to the virtual printer called PDF.
The other was is there is a Chrome extension called Save as PDF, and a couple of others that do the same thing. It adds a menu item or a icon to your browser that will allow you to save an entire page as a PDF.
I prefer the print to PDF method myself.

How do people with ADHD break down their work into small tasks?
I break things down into sub-tasks by trying to define the overall task and then break it down by actions and by time. I’ll start by making a really, really thorough outline of what needs to be done. Often I’ll explain it to a little toy dragon I have on my desktop, it really helps to have something to address and to try and explain it to in detail. The size and complexity of the work, as well as my experience in the matter at hand helps determine how detailed I make the outline. If this is the first time I’ve done something or if it’s really complicated I’ll make a rough outline and follow it up with sub-outlines holding all the fine details. Make it as specific as you need to but try to not overdo it too much. It is entirely possible to get lost in the details. I try and keep each outline…

Does turning off your computer every night hurt the hardware inside of it, or will doing so eventually make the computer unusable in the future (not due to any other reason)?
It will save energy and wear and tear on moving parts if it shut down correctly at night. However, I would suggest just letting it hibernate, it is very much like turning the computer off, but a part of the computer remains on so it can start much more quickly the next time you want it, and there will be slightly less wear and tear on the components that are briefly stressed during power on. I doubt it makes much difference in the long run and it easily comes down to a matter of preference. Personally, I rather like hibernating my computer. What that does is copy your RAM to the system disk and reload it the next time it starts, appearing as if the computer was never off. The same programs are open, everything is where it was.

When I was anemic, a long time ago, it has a devastating effect on my energy level. I was severely anemic due to a chronic condition and I had no energy at all, I felt weak and while not quite dizzy I felt like I had already exerted myself hard that day, even when I had just gotten up in the morning. I was also cold a lot, something that I’d never had happen to me much before. I normally prefer very cool temperatures, and unless the wind is blowing I don’t wear jackets outside until it’s getting close to freezing. This time the temperature in the house was normal and I was very cold, to the point where I was taking hot showers to try and warm up. It was when I mentioned that fact to my doctor that he ordered the hemoglobin test that found me to be so low.

I’ve been told that modafinil is supposed to be helpful for ADHD and I suppose it is helpful, but more in a fatigue-fighting way that keeps me from getting cloudy-headed when tired more than increasing my attention. However, I’m fortunate enough to already be taking bupropion (Wellbutrin) which I’ve heard is sometimes prescribed for ADHD and I’m already on a medium dose of adderall.

Why does Linux need so much less RAM to function than Windows on a laptop?
What you’re seeing is the amount of RAM that the base installs use when running. Windows is a much more “everything including the kitchen sink” type of installation, it defaults to a much, much wider range of installed system software than a standard Linux installation might include. This of course uses RAM while it’s all running the background. Cortana eats a lot of RAM when in use, so do a lot of features intended to integrate your phone and other devices, various diagnostic routines, monitoring routines, maintenance routines and so on. On the other hand, most Linux installations don’t install such things that take such overhead by default, though many of them are available for Linux, you would just have to install them from the software center or whatever your particular flavor uses.

Is quantum entanglement subject to the “speed of light” limit for transferring information between two distant points?
The initial premise is inaccurate. Quantum entanglement does not transfer information at all, much less at, above, or below the speed of light. It is my best understanding that once two particles have been entangled, they can be in one of two states, and you cannot tell which state, spin up or spin down, an individual particle is in without breaking the entanglement. The entangled states, from our viewpoint, essentially masks what the spin states of the two particles are. Particles that are entangled, once again to the best of my knowledge, are generally generated that way, perhaps from the result of a particle’s decay or from one of many other methods with which I am unfamiliar. I have heard of particles being deliberately entangled, and I’ve heard of larger and more complex items being en…

Well, you wouldn’t be able to use CDs without an external CD drive, but that’s about the only consequence of not having a CD drive. Computers without CD drives still have USB ports and can utilize USB drives and Flash drives and can boot from USB and Flash drives, making CDs fairly obsolete.

What are the consequences of putting a bad stick of RAM in your computer?
When you put a bad stick of RAM in a computer, the computer will sometimes boot just fine and will be missing that amount of memory.

Other times the bad stick of RAM will take down the other RAM in the dual channel setup and you will be missing twice the value of the bad stick. On other occasions, the computer won’t even boot because the bad stick of RAM is interfering with the signals that are present in the computer that controls access to the RAM, refreshes, addressing, thing like that.

What is the maximum possible clock speed of a CPU? What would be its effect on computing power if it were ever reached by real-world processors?
The maximum possible clock speed of a processor would seem to be determined by the speed that the signals can move through the processor. The dimensions of the processor subunits have to be smaller than the wavelength of the electric signal, otherwise the clock signal couldn’t propagate throughout the processor units to keep everything in step. Without doing the math myself, I would think it would be in the low to medium 2 digit GHz. But you would run into nearly insurmountable heat problems long before the maximum. That’s why modern CPUs top out in the 4ish GHz range and use multiple cores to gain more processing power. They could be designed to go a bit faster, but the speed isn’t worth the reduced reliability because the concentrated power dissipation and therefore heat would reduce the…

How fast can a computer read from or write to its hard drive?
It depends on the interface and the type and speed of drive. Using a standard drive rotational speed of 5400 RPM and a SATA III interface, I get in the neighborhood of 140MB/s to 160MB/s reads. Writes are about 1/2 to 2/3 of that.
Using a M2 SATA SSD, you can expect into the 500MB/s to nearly 700MB/s for reads.
Using a M2 PCIE-4 SSD, I reliably get over 1700MB/s, but that takes up 4 PCIE lanes and many people can’t spare that many, nor do all motherboard that support M2 also support it for reads.

What is it like spending time in a mental health facility?
I have a lack of personal experience other than as a visitor, but the first things that come to mind are lack of privacy, having to participate in various uninteresting activities, and not being able to choose who you get to associate with.
Then again, you do meet an interesting cross-section of people from all walks of life.
If you’re in involuntarily, it’s much like jail with the exception that people are trying to help you.
If it’s voluntary, it’s not too bad because you can always pull the plug if it gets too intense. But that defeats the purpose of having gone in.
None of the ones I’ve been in have had enough varied books to keep someone self-entertained for long, but then you’re usually supposed to be doing something with someone most of the time.

These refugees had already been through the beginning of their asylum process and are to return for various court dates. They have been released into the US interior to do as they will until that time. If they commit crimes, asylum is off and out they go. If they don’t return for their dates, then they have broken the law. All of these asylum-seekers are already involved in the legal process which is proceeding according to US law and International Treaty which the USA helped set up and are signatories to. Look into the Immigration and Nationality Act for specifics. The (long) definition is in 101(a)(42)
We are bound to honor requests for asylum, and Venezuela is a place that they come from legitimately.
I’m certainly no fan of illegal immigration, at all, and things need to be done about it, but shipping refugees around isn’t going to help whatsoever. We could start by heavily penalizing businesses that employ illegal labor. We could help other countries address some issues so people aren’t forced to leave due to dire economic circumstances. It would probably be cheaper than dealing with the flow at the border.

Can a computer run without any storage device (HDD)? If yes, then how can it be done?
I remember something called “thin clients” that were computers without storage other than the BIOS and RAM. They automatically booted over the network, kept their data locally in the RAM, and any persistent storage was out on the network. All a thin client really needed was RAM, Motherboard, Video, Network and peripherals like keyboard, mouse, monitor, maybe .a printer if that wasn’t networked as well.
I’m not sure if that is still a thing, but my doctor’s computer is just about 6″ on a side, maybe 1–1/2″ thick, makes no sound and has no ventilation I’ve been able to discern, and definitely is running network apps and browser apps. If their network is down it doesn’t boot, so I suspect it’s a thin client of some sort.

As I recall, in the early negotiations over the budget Pelosi offered Trump a fairly substantial amount for the wall, enough to build a pretty decent amount, but it wasn’t high enough to suit Trump and he refused.
Pelosi then reduced the amount and resubmitted it to Trump, he again refused it because it wasn’t enough, and it was less than before.
Pelosi resubmitted it a 3rd time with even less earmarked for the wall. Trump, not knowing how to negotiate at all other than to bluster, didn’t seem to understand what was going on, so he kept on and kept on in this vein until he ended up with a token amount for the wall.
100% his fault.

I rather doubt he heard about it in time to do anything. He’s a part-time resident at best. Yes, the whole world showed Desantis sending unwilling people blindly into a community that had no clue they were coming and no infrastructure to handle anyone and many came out immediately and fed, clothed and provided temporary housing for them. I don’t think that’s the image you wanted projected. The very first person they encountered went and immediately got water for them and informed others of the situation. Those people, many of them professionals, put down what they were doing and came out to help.

You didn’t pay attention, they housed them, temporarily, that same day, and took immediate action to make sure their needs were taken car of, and the state promptly moved them to a space where they can be adequately housed, gain access to services, education for the children, medical attention for the adults, legal assistance, all of which the Turd of Tallahassee could have used to help various immigrants in his state.

They don’t. First of all the illegal immigrants cross over along a VERY long border, so the individual amounts moving through one area are usually fairly low except at a few concentration points, where the boarder control agents work to take care of things (not the states, but the feds with federal money I might add). When they get released they spread out through the US to a number of hubs. Second, crossing the walking across the boarder isn’t the primary means of arrival for most illegal aliens, overstaying their legal visas is. Your narrative doesn’t hold up very well.

Can you explain what it is like to live with attention deficit disorder (ADD) to someone who has never had it before?
My usual go-to description is having ADHD, primarily inattentive, is like having people sitting on either side of you having a quiet argument. Your attention constant is interfered with, making it hard to read, think and plan, or concentrate closely on something. Additionally, the people on either side of you keep bringing your attention to stray sounds and anything that floats through their heads. As far as the hyperactive type, I tend to described it as taking amphetamines without the buzz that goes with it. Constant fidgeting, making small movements, discomfort with sitting still. Neither are particularly satisfactory for the ADHD person but if a non-ADHD person is reasonably imaginative, it helps. As for me, I sometimes feel like the dogs in the movie Up!

Is it possible to recover data from an external hard disk which doesn't have power supply (no LED lights)?
In some cases, yes. The best bet is to restore from backups. If no backups exist, that’s an issue in and of itself. If you don’t backup your data you are just leasing it from fate. Is it under warranty? If so, contact the appropriate tech support and follow their directions. If the external drive has it’s own power supply, a known good power supply from a similar drive with the same voltage output and equal or greater current output could be used to see if the external drive will power up. If so, all that is needed is a new power supply which could probably be scrounged or bought from a computer repair shop. If there is no external power supply, try a different cable in a different USB outlet, or on a different computer. Be sure to use the appropriate port, I have a USB3 drive that is not back…

Are there any good reasons for not using a solid state drive (SSD) as your main drive and instead sticking with a regular hard disk (HDD)?
Three reasons come to mind. A big one is price. The price per unit of storage is much higher on an SSD than a HDD, and HDDs are available in much much larger amounts of storage than a SSD is. The biggest standard available HDDs are in the teens of Terabytes while SSDs have just nudged into the low Terabytes at several times the cost. Another big reason has to do with storage volatility. SSDs ultimately store their information in the form of electrons trapped in the gates of a type of transistor. Due to the nature of quantum mechanics those electrons will slowly tunnel out of their transistors over time, and if the drive is left unpowered for a long time the data will slowly become corrupted until after some years it’s unusable. On the other hand, HDDs store their data in little areas on a ma…

Great start to the explanation! I would like to add a few details to flesh it out a little bit.
Each orbital can contain only 2 electrons, maximum, I believe due to the exclusion principle, but not certain on the name. Electrons have a quality called “spin” which isn’t exactly a spinning motion, but close enough for this level of discussion. Only one electron of a particular spin can be in an orbital, so only two electrons, with opposite spins, can occupy an orbital.
As Duff Howell said, they fill from the bottom up under normal circumstances, called the “ground state”, which is an unexcited atom, one that has no extra energy.
As Duff Howell mentioned, incoming photons of specific energy levels can kick electrons up to another level, but only in certain discrete amounts. Each orbital has a very specific energy state that belongs to it and the incoming photon must match that energy state exactly to kick a particular electron up to the higher state. Conversely, the electron must emit a photon of that value to drop back down to the original state. Most atoms, depending on their weight and size, have a whole lot of orbitals (arranged in shells) than can be reached by a number of photon events. Eventually, though, the electron gets too far from the atom an the atom loses that particular electron, resulting in a “free” electron, one that can move around on it’s own, and leaves behind an ionized atom. When you hear about something being ionized, that is the state being referred to, the state of having one or more of the electrons removed from the atom by increasing it’s energy beyond a certain point.
There exists a point for every type of atom where the atom can have all electrons stripped off. If you have a group of atoms like that, you have the beginnings of a “plasma”. Fun stuff!
These energy states involved with electron movement are “quantized”, which is where the word quantum comes from, quantum being the singular form of the word, quanta being the plural. All it means is “amount”, as in it takes a certain amount of energy to make a particular change.
Duff Howell mentioned about the various criteria that are involved in determining an electron’s energy, so I won’t repeat it other than to concur.
Many properties of atoms follow from this fairly simple fact, the way an atom behaves chemically is part of that, and ions, as something that is ionized is called, is very important in some chemistry. The spectra of an atom, which I’m not going to get into here, but can be easily looked up on Wikipedia or similar, is another consequence of the way electron orbitals fill and empty.

Why does an LED glow when connected to a battery through a resistor but not with no resistor attached to it, even though both have current flowing through them?
When you have a resistor in the proper range of values for the LED and the particular voltage source involved, the resistor will limit the flow of electricity to the level that will allow the LED to light up and not be destroyed. Without a resistor, depending on how high the voltage source is and the particular LED (most of them) the sudden very heavy surge of current through the LED will destroy it nearly instantly, sometimes even so fast that you won’t see the flash, though normally the flash is bright enough to be noticable. Then the current will stop flowing because the LED is burned out, much like a flashlight bulb plugged into an electric socket would be. Other possibilities of an LED being connected to a power source and not lighting up include not enough voltage is present, because a…

Are there some other theories of the root cause of ADHD besides Low dopamine (e.g. different genetic profile, environment, etc)?
I tend more to the epigenetic origin of ADHD.
At this point I’ve become fairly convinced that it is mostly due to genetics, but not all of those genes are always expressed. There can be many events, many chemical exposures, many environmental exposures that alter the way genetics are expressed, and I think that is why it appears in some people, doesn’t appear in others, and sometimes appears to skip a generation.
Also, the variations in the types of ADHD indicate that there are either more than a just few genes involved, or that variable gene expression (or even both!) are involved in the development of ADHD.

For how long it stays in your body, that is basically correct. I don’t think there is any “relax time” for caffeine that I’m aware of, but maybe I’m different, I can’t really say.
However, the 400mg per 24 hours is a long way from correct. On occasion I take 200mg caffeine every few hours when I need to up my concentration (I have ADHD), and it works wonderfully. If I exceed about 800mg/day, I’ll get the mild runs, maybe a mild headache, and trouble sleeping later but that’s it. The LD50 (50% of takers would die of toxicity) of caffeine is 300mg/kg! for me that would be 30 grams, or 30,000mg. I would figure that I’d die of a heart attack long before then, but 400mg/day is plainly not correct.

A 1TB drive takes 1TB of temporary space. This way is highly inefficient, drive images take a LONG time to move over the network regardless of the size of the drive as every sector has to be imaged and then transferred.

Can we use a capacitor as a resistor or vice versa?
The short answer is no, resistors and capacitors perform different functions using different physical methods. A resistor “resists” the flow of current, restricting the flow by a specified amount. A capacitor briefly stores a small charge, with varying effects on a circuit depending on if the current is Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC), and the frequency of the AC if used. A resistor works to slow the amount of electricity flowing in a circuit much like stepping on a garden hose will slow the delivery of water. A resistor works just the same on AC or DC with no complicated mathematics other than the use of fractions and simple algebra at the most. Resistors are accurate to within a given percentage of their value, measured in Ohms, that percentage varying according to the grad…

I’ve had exactly those sorts of experiences. If asked specific questions about what I had been doing I could usually explain pretty well, but as to what day it happened? Usually not a clue. And it’s not restricted to just days, but months, seasons, even years. I know of a lot of things that I’ve done, I’m not missing much memory that I know of, but many times I can be hard pressed to tell you within 5 years of when it happened unless there is some sort of event that I can pin down when it happened.
For instance, I remember a conversation I had with a good friend. If he hadn’t mentioned about the Murrah federal building bombing the day before, I wouldn’t have had a clue as to when it happened. That sort of thing.
I hope that once your referral comes through you can get useful treatment options for yourself. I’ve found that with good treatment it is easy enough to get by, with a few caveats. I used to work internal tech support for a Fortune 500 company. I constantly had an issue where I could either talk to the caller and troubleshoot, or I could make notes of what I was doing, but I never got to where I can do both at the same time! That’s not something that people think of when they talk about ADHD, but that’s one of the things I’ve discovered.

My mother knew something was up before I was born, I was in near constant motion a couple of months before I was born, she described it as like being about to have a Mexican jumping bean. From right after birth I was strongly hyperactive, which was quite a challenge for a young first-time mother. That being said, I can see some reasons why attention span and/or attention to detail might change over the years. Aside from changing circumstances in your life and surroundings that may be more challenging that you’ve previously had to deal with, I can think of a few other things that might be going on. It could be that you’re getting into a time in your life that taxes your natural endowment o…

A PhD literally means “Doctor of Philosophy”! That’s what the “D” means. I fail to see the problem at all. They have earned the right to be called doctor by the investiture of all those difficult years of study in their area of expertise.
All my life I’ve called people with a PhD doctor if I knew they had one, unless they’re a close personal friend. I grew up in an area around Emory University in a neighborhood where a lot of university teaches had settled when the neighborhood was young. Many of my friends had one (or two!) parents who I would always call Dr. (whatever) instead of Mr. or Mrs. No stopping to think about it, that’s just the way it was.

I really hate to have to say this, but you are correct, I’ve had a friend that kept saying how she had pelvic pain and was literally given Tylenol and sent home, just like you suggested. It wasn’t until she started urinating blood that they took her seriously, she had a terrible bladder infection. Nasty business, that. They had to catheterize her and she was on antibiotics for about 6 weeks!

Do hyperactive people with ADHD find it very difficult to stay at home relaxing, like they need to leave the house as if claustrophobic?
I’m not sure that is ADHD related so much as driven by other aspects of personality, such as the extrovert-introvert axis. I’m a very strong introvert and I have a pretty strong manifestation of ADHD. I can absolutely stay at home and work on various projects, read, watch TV, you name it and not find it difficult at all.

What would happen if anime made a story about people with ADHD? How would this impact the ADHD community? What should anime industries do to make it relateable and understanding?
Looking back at the character stereotypes normally found in most anime shows, the spacey, hyperactive, distractible and impulsive character is very common, and all that often occurs all in one character. That certainly sounds like stereotypical ADHD to me. I’ve seen characters that fit that description quite closely from many different series starting in the early ’80’s, unfortunately they’re usually used for comic relief. At least they have the grace to not make the characters stupid too. I don’t know of any shows specifically about a character with this stereotype but it could be interesting if done well, at least from my point of view.

Why do people with ADHD have trouble remembering their childhood?

How does ADD/ADHD affect a person's ability to pay attention?
In one word: drastically. When not medicated my attention can wander a lot, even with no direct distractions. At times, especially if bored, my mind simply doesn’t stay on point and I’ll find myself having thoughts about this morning’s breakfast or some show I watched yesterday or maybe two years ago, or something like the sound of the building's A/C blower. Once I eventually become aware that my attention has derailed, often I can bring my attention back around, but then it wanders again. When bored, I’m very handicapped by my ADHD and it’s caused me real trouble at times. I am what I think of as self-distracting. I don’t necessarily need something external to attract my attention away from what I’m trying to pay attention to. I’m also one of those people who has hyper-focus. If something e…

ADHD isn’t something you “get”. It’s an either - or, you have it, or you don’t. Fortunately for most people it isn’t contagious. Of course, there is a large variation in the intensity of various symptoms among individuals. I can’t give a hard answer to this question because there are still a lot of questions about what causes ADHD, but the general consensus seems to be that it is likely for genetics to play a role, but it is unclear how much of a role. So, if your identical twin has ADHD, you at least have the genes that are involved in having ADHD, but in your case they might not be expressed for some reason or another. Since you seem to suspect that you might have it, I would suggest that you speak with a doctor or qualified counsellor or other qualified professional about a proper intervie…

I quit smoking weed back in mid June and its now into the first week of September. Why am I still failing my drug screens?
That totally depends on the type of drug screening. Hair sample? You’ll fail until all the hair you grew while using is gone. A hair sample will retain the metabolites indefinitely. A urine test? Depends on if it’s a quick chemical screen or if they run it through a mass spectrometer. The quick screen USUALLY won’t show usage for longer than 4-ish weeks, unless you smoked for a really long time and/or in large amounts. Edibles tend to stick around for a while too since they go in via the digestive system. THC is also fat-soluble, meaning it’s dissolved in your body fat and only comes back out at a fairly slow rate. Depending on how much, for how long, and how much body fat you have it can go double that. The mass spectrometry test is hard to beat, it’s good for months if you were a regular u…

What is the effect of feedback on an op-amp circuit?
Negative feedback in an op-amp circuit is used to provide for stable circuit operation. A bare op-amp has such a high gain that the slightest imbalance on the inputs, including the normal offset voltage, will tend to throw the op-amp as far to one rail or another as it can go. Once an op-amp hits the rail, it takes a much longer time to recover, so this is usually not desired behavior. By feeding back a pre-determined amount of the output signal to the inverting input, this tendency to rail is better controlled. The part of the output that is applied to the inverting input slows down the rate of change in the output by an amount proportional to the amount of feedback. This is negative feedback. Long long ago, in the 1920’s I believe, the basic principle of negative feedback in electronics wa…

What is the effect of using thick wires or thin wires on the total resistance in series circuits?
All else being the same, there is less conductor available to carry the current in a thin wire, and that will raise the resistance over a thicker wire. The resistance in a wire is determined by that material that the wire is made from, the cross-section of the wire (diameter1000 meters or 1000 feet or however you wish to measure it. So, a thinner wire has more resistance than a thicker wire, and a longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. For example, 22 gauge copper hookup wire often used in hobby electronics has a resistance somewhere around 16 ohms per 1000 feet. 12 gauge copper house wiring is somewhere around 1.5 ohms per 1000 feet, and 30 gauge copper wire (small magnet wire) is around 100 ohms per 1000 feet.

What would be the safest Depression drug that does not cause uncontrollable body movements?
No one drug can be considered to be the “safest” because there is both a very wide range of medications available as well as a very wide spectrum of people and their individual metabolisms and situations. What is super-safe for one person might be very different for another person. That doesn’t even begin to address people that might have metabolic irregularities. As an example, many of the popular antidepressants can push someone who is undiagnosed Bipolar, who appears to be depressed, over into a manic/hypomanic state which can lead to dangerous behavior for that person and others, where as the same medication might be literally lifesaving for someone in a deep suicidal depression.

Does having an inattentive type of ADHD make it harder to remember things than other types of ADHD?
My issue has always been in paying enough attention to get it into my head in the first place. Once it’s there, I’m generally good. I have an excellent episodic memory (if I was paying any attention at all), and I can still remember a fair amount of some of my college lectures from the early 80’s.
Getting it into my head in the first place is the real struggle, most especially if it’s not something that I can manage to make myself get interested in. With me, if I was tuned out when something happens, many times it’s like I was never there at all, no retention of much if anything. I can’t even begin to remember any of my high school trig, I had to relearn it later on.

I didn’t stop smoking from being in a coma, but I had pneumonia for a really long time, about 3 months. I was on the edge of hospitalization for about 2 of those months, mostly having to stay in bed because I was too tired/weak to move around much. Every few days I was having to go to the doctor for bloodwork and oxygen saturation checks. For the first week I insanely kept trying really hard to smoke, the addiction ran deep, but as you might imagine it was ultimately impossible. When I finally started coughing so hard that my head would swim, my vision would black out and a little blood would come up is when I finally stopped, my body just couldn’t take it anymore.
My body was so happy that I had stopped smoking that I don’t even remember the physical withdrawal at all, maybe I was just too sick to differentiate the physical symptoms from my pneumonia symptoms, I’m not sure.
This was back in 1998, I’ve never gone back to smoking since then. But sometimes, usually out of the blue, I will have a nearly intolerable desire to smoke. I don't necessarily want a cigarette so much as I want the nicotine. I have to remind myself that if I go get some gum that I’ll be stuck having to get off nicotine all over again.
Social cues can still get to me a bit. When I still drank alcohol in a bar, I would often have a strong social urge to smoke simply because whenever I drank in that circumstance I had a cigarette, or several, during that time. Rarely, I still get the urge to smoke when I’m sitting at my computer with a cup of coffee, which is another time I used to always smoke. Fortunately over the past 24 years that particular urge has really faded, it’s probably been a month now since I have had that particular craving.
Getting past the physical addiction was never that much of the problem in the 5 or 6 times I quit, it was always the social and habitual aspect that had me throwing in the towel. I think that the mental association of smoking with those awful coughing fits when I had the pneumonia is what has let me stay quit all these years.

Can you be both bipolar and have ADHD at the same time? If so, how do they interact with each other in terms of treatment and symptoms?
Being Bipolar and having ADHD can definitely interact with each other, but not so much at the extremes of the Bipolar cycles. The ways they can interact are strongly dependent on a persons individual presentations. Usually Bipolar disorder will overshadow ADHD in most people except during the middle of the cycle. Especially while hypomanic, having ADHD can work so as to completely ruin any concentration you might normally have been able to summon. Hypomania already causes major issues with the inability to intentionally direct your thinking, and having the ADHD makes it that much harder to cope. Usually though, unless the ADHD is really bad, it will be overshadowed by the hypomania. I intentionally left mania out of this because if you are in a full-blown manic state or approaching the top,…

Is hypersensitivity to stimuli (e.g. touch) a possible feature of ADHD? A woman I have a crush on (who has been diagnosed w/ ADHD) says that while she strongly desires physical affection, close contact with others causes her significant discomfort.
When I was a much younger, touching me at all, whether by a person or not, could distract me terribly. One of the worst offenders was the tag in the back of my shirt. It was mildly itchy, scratchy, and could distract me to the point where I wanted to stand up, scream, and whip off my shirt in the middle of class. I didn’t, but I sure wanted to at times. My first solution was to cut the tags out of my shirts, but in some ways that was worse because now I had that little hard ridge of extra stitching where the tag had been sewed in. It felt like a no-win situation. Collar shirts were much worse, and a tie ensured that I would be a nervous, unpleasant mess.

Can you become completely resistant to Ritalin? I used to take 108 mg to feel something, but some days ago I ended up taking 648 mg throughout the day, because I wasn’t feeling anything. Why don’t I feel anything with such a high dose?
Ritalin, methylphenidate, is quite addictive and over time will require higher and higher doses to get the same effect as you become more and more resistant to it. Resistance is one of the major signs of full-blown addiction. Ritalin is in the general class of methamphetamines and has all the risks of the same. Long term misuse of ritalin at the higher dosages can and will damage your dopaminergic pathways in your brain over time, resulting in a reduced capability to feel pleasure, among other unpleasantness. It’s also rather toxic to your liver, it will drive your blood pressure higher, often dangerously high. Fortunately (or not) it’s really hard to kill yourself with ritalin, it’s LD50 is around 190 mg/ Kg, so if you weigh 75 Kg, you’d have to take around 14-1/4 grams to have a 50% chanc…

If you spin a magnet inside of a coil of wire in a given direction you will generate voltage. If the magnet were to suddenly stop and begin spinning in the opposite direction, what effect would this have?
It would still generate electricity, it would just change the polarity. If you have a coil connected between points A and B, with the magnet moving linearly in such a direction that A is positive and B is negative, switching the direction of the magnet will switch which terminal is positive, i.e B will be positive and A will be negative, which is the same effect you would have if the poles were swapped. Spinning a magnet inside of coil will generally introduce a alternating current (unless mechanical steps are taken to switch the generated electricity based on which pole is where in the rotation) because of the opposite poles moving over the coil in the same direction. The number of poles and the speed of the rotation controls the frequency of the alternating current. The strength of the mag…

What is the point of an op-amp if the resistors are what determines the gain?
The resistors don’t provide the gain, they control what the final gain of the op amp will be. An op amp has a very very high level of amplification by design. Except for a few corner cases, the amplification is so high as to not be useful on it’s own. A gain of 80db to over 100db are not uncommon ( which translates roughly to a gain of 10,000 to over 100,000, sometimes even higher, I’ve seen one over 120db). The resistors feed back a small, controlled amount of the output signal to the negative input, cancelling out all but the desired amount of the gain. As a result, an op amp with negative feedback is much more stable, has less noise, and a much wider bandwidth than one used “bare”, that is without a feedback network. One without negative feedback is almost unusable except as a slow compar…

How do increase the upper cut off frequency of an op-amp, if gain is 400-500?
As the Gain Bandwidth Product (GBW) (GBP) (the result of multiplying the Gain at a particular frequency of an op-amp by it’s bandwidth at a that frequency) of an op-amp is dictated by it’s design and manufacturing process, there are really only two things that can be done when you are up against the GBW GBP limitations of an op-amp. Either break up the amplifier into multiple stages or use a different op-amp, either of which may have drawbacks in your individual situation.¶

situation. The harder a GBP is pushed on a particular application, the more distortion and instabilities will tend to happen. Plus, very high-gain stages are very, very unforgiving with their physical layouts. Lower amplification per stage is much more forgiving. Also, gain drops off rapidly as the bandwidth is pushed.¶

When using the currently selected op-amp is necessary due to budgetary or supply limitations, my usual approach is to break the amplifier into two or more stages, whose overall gain is the product of the gains of the sub-stages.¶

sub-stages. That also gives you a chance to build in a bit more negative feedback to keep things more stable at the higher amplifications. If you are able to wrap the whole thing in a negative feedback loop, all the better, but that can take a bit more planning in the design phase.¶

For example, if a gain of 500 is required, that amplifier can be broken down into a 2-stage amplifier with the first stage having a gain of 25 and the second stage having a gain of 20, for an overall 25 * 20 gain working out to a total of 500, but with a much higher total available bandwidth.¶

However, breaking the amplifier into two stages will increase the noise level over that of a single-stage as the first op-amp’s noise figure is amplified by the second stage, so if your noise level is important that might not be the way to go.¶

go. Making the second stage the lower amplification stage can help some with this somewhat.¶

The other alternative is to use a higher GBW GBP op-amp. This means looking at the commercial sites that list this information in their product descriptions, followed by looking at the data sheets directly to make the final choice.choice. Just about any approach is going to have some trade-offs and it might well be necessary to put together a few test circuits to see how they actually perform. Calculations are all nice and good, but there is never a substitute for real-world testing.

Can ADHD kill you?
ADHD in and of itself is not a dangerous condition, it certainly won’t kill you in and of itself. However, some of it’s deficits, particularly those involving in lowered abilities to assess risk and an increased degree of impulsivity, can magnify the routine dangers that are a part of growing up. I cannot count the number of bicycle accidents, some fairly severe, that I had as a child. Broken bones, medium to severe abrasions and lacerations, occasionally resulting in stitches or major road-rash. Countless impacts to my head resulting in probable concussions, all of this was a normal part of my youth. Most of this was from doing something on the spur of the moment (the impulse control issue) or due to being distracted while riding or performing other mildly dangerous activity. This was in th…

Is it safe to smoke weed while on prescription ADHD meds?
It entirely depends on which medication you’re on. As for bupropion, don’t, it will keep it from working correctly. Adderall, ritalin, and other stimulants, I don’t personally see an issue with it, other than weed blows your concentration all to hell and has a mild lasting effect on concentration if you are a daily or multiple times weekly smoker. That lasting effect would tend to blunt the effectiveness of the stimulant medication. I know several people that are ADD and have been weed consumers to varying degrees and that seems to be the general result. The reason I mentioned buproprion is that it works through a different process ( it is a SSRI/SNRI), and drinking or smoking weed seems to render that either useless or it interferes so much with the action that it might as well have kept it…

Launching the high-level nuclear waste into the sun is one of those evergreen ideas that keeps cropping up time and time again but isn’t practical for a number of reasons, both economic and safety-related.
I first heard the idea mentioned in some science-fiction written in the pre-sixties era, I’m not really sure how much older but I think it is significantly older than that, probably late forties or early fifties.
The problem with the economic portion of the problem is a combination of how insanely expensive it would be to simply loft all those multi-tons of waste (the high level waste tends to be mostly heavy metals and such, very dense) into orbit, even at SpaceX prices. Then it would have to be boosted from Earth orbit to solar orbit, then deorbited from the solar orbit that the Earth occupies, which would be an insanely fuel-intensive operation, to get the waste to the sun. Even science probes don’t do it directly, they make multiple gravitational braking passes over many orbits. I don’t remember how many passes it took the Mercury mission to get in close, but it took a fair number of them. So we have the original price to boost it to orbit, then pay to move away from Earth, then pay to deorbit the Sun and drop it on in. Plus the fuel to make all those maneuvers, and the machinery to hold the fuel and make use of it. To just add to the difficulty level would be the navigation required, you just can’t drop something in the sun. Any object that doesn’t have sufficient orbital momentum to stay in orbit will drop towards the sun and more often than not will pull a hyperbolic pass around the sun and end up in an eccentric orbit. I don’t know the actual figures, but it surely would have to be in the multiple millions per ton, if not more, to dispose of it in that manner. And then there is the other problem.
The other problem and the real show-stopper being that it would only take one launch accident or failure to achieve orbit to potentially spread the high-level waste under consideration over a much wider area, which could be anywhere from the launch site to any other place that the orbit might have passed over. Maybe deep ocean, maybe a city, who knows? Now, it is possible to put the waste in a container that could survive a explosion or crash landing, but that would add even more weight and expense to the already hyper-expensive effort.
So no, I don’t think it will ever be practical. If we could get over being afraid of fast breeder reactors, we could use a lot of the waste to manufacture more fuel that could be used several more times. The (in the US at least) government fears proliferation because fast breeders can make large quantities of plutonium quite easily, making them a potential nuclear proliferation risk. I do know that other countries have at lease some breeder reactors, I think France has one, maybe more, but I don’t know for sure. If I recall my education correctly, breeder reactors should be fairly inexpensive to operate safely, certainly no more than a regular reactor except for the separation of useful isotopes and such.

What is the reason computer storage devices are rectangular shaped?
I would posit that it’s because they make better use of space. If the objects were round, they wouldn’t fit side-by-side very efficiently. Rectangular objects just pack better and more regularly into a given space.
Additionally, drives and such used to use a common form factor so you could place them in a case as you pleased (in the drive section). Computers seem to be getting away from that with the advent of the SSD since they are so small and can be put in nearly any available space.

How do stimulants help someone who has ADHD? Does an overactive mind add stimulation?
From what I’ve read in bits and pieces over the years, part of the brain in ADDers is underactive, specifically the part that governs attention and executive function. Taking a stimulant, usually fairly mild but not always, pushes that part (among many others) to a higher level of activity, resulting in more manageable impulse control and better ability to direct attention.

I think that your students are very lucky to have a teacher like you. I sure would have benefitted from teaching like that in high school! I think that the lack of rigor is one of the things that turned me off so much about history and the like in my early days. It wasn’t until I had a particular college professor that I was able to understand and appreciate history. I was lucky to have some similar teachers earlier on in the math and sciences.
I think you made a really major point with the lack of interconnectedness of the lessons. The only teaching that I have done personally is individual or small group tutoring. I’ve only ever taught one class, and that was much more like a mass tutoring session. That interconnectedness is something I’ve always aimed for without knowing really being aware of it. I usually tutored in math or computer science and I tried to build on the past sessions.
I appreciate this short discussion. Not only have I vented opinions, though they weren’t nearly as well thought out as I had thought they were, but I’ve learned a number of things too. Thank you!

I do not have any direct knowledge of what is being taught in US civics classes these days, but I’ve heard from several different parents of current school children that it has a lot of fluff as compared with 30 years ago, with not enough time devoted to the basic mechanics of our government. Some of the nonsense that I’ve heard from the younger segments of society lends some weight to that observation.
Above, when I said political science course, I meant something more serious than civics, much more general in nature, but it doesn’t necessarily need to be a full class of it’s own for most people. I think that a brief exposure to the various types of governments and the philosophies that both gave rise to them and drive them would be an excellent addition to some sort of class, but I don’t know if civics would be the one. Civics seems to be focused inwards, just on the US. What I am envisioning would be much more general. World geography was a class when I was in high school (secondary education), fitting the political end of things in with their geography might be a good way, or something similar. There certainly should be an elective available that covers such things in good detail.
Sadly, I don’t know many people around me that could tell me basically how the British PM is selected, much less than providing any sort of detail at all. Just listening to others here it seems to be “common knowledge” in much of the US that the Scandinavian countries are completely socialist and much of Europe is assumed to be as well. The average US citizen’s knowledge of other governments is painfully lacking, and I think that colors the impression that US citizens have of other countries and informs their attitudes towards them. For such a large and diverse country I fear that many of us harbor terribly provincial outlooks.

Less than a month is all anyone really needs to tell the basic differences between the various governmental types. I’ve had exactly one class in political science, back in college.

I really think that a single class in political science should be part of the secondary curriculum in most places, it would really short-circuit some of these ignorant claims that we keep hearing about. Of course, then the focus might shift towards the politicians trying to slant those courses in the directions suited to them.

Can you use an NVMe SSD as external storage?
Yes!
The only two things you need is a NVME adapter, plenty of them on Amazon or your favorite electronics retailer, put it in the case, hook it up to the computer with a USB cable, and it’s ready to format and use, or just use if it’s already been formatted and has data on it from when it was in the computer.
However, I would strongly suggest that you use a nice adapter with a minimum USB 3.0 unless you’re the patient type.
There are two types of NVME, but most of the NVME adapters take both types, so it’s not so much of a concern.
The two types of NVME SSD are the PCI-E interface and the SATA interface. They look the same except the way the slots on the insertion end of the NVME stick itself are arranged.

The two carbon-hydrogen bonds provide a decent amount of energy when it combusts (i.e. the bonds are broken) same as in methane or the end bonds in the higher hydrocarbons, and the triple carbon bond is where the magic of all the energy is stored. Having that much energy invested in the triple bonds makes them much less stable, hence the issue with pressure decomposition of the acetylene.

Mathematics gives us a system of determining some things, attributes or other information about an object or objects or relationships between objects from a set of information. Simplistically speaking, it can let you determine the correct volume of wood to build a shed given certain dimensions, or it can help you determine how and when to apply force to an object to get it to swing by Saturn, or it can be used to infer probabilities of outcomes, amon…

Maybe, maybe not, the SS as a unit is the point of the spear when it comes to computer investigations and such, it has a high concentration of know-how. If it’s an actual conspiracy that starts up high in the management, the SS has more than enough know-how to make things either disappear or at least be VERY hard to recreate. The FBI is pretty good too, but I don’t think they’re in quite the same league.

Can you put a different operating system on an external hard drive?
Yes it’s actually fairly easy. As long as the external drive shows up on its own without any drivers or anything (USB and the like) it’s a valid destination for installation of an OS. If the USB requires a Windows driver though, all bets are off, it would be a maybe/maybe not situation. However, and a big however, it will be much slower than one on a drive that sits on the SATA bus, such as the ones inside your computer. I would imagine an ESATA drive would work well, though I have no personal experience with one. Typically you would use a USB3 drive to install the OS to, but a USB2 drive will work, if you have the patience. I have installed OSes on a variety of flash drives, external hard drives of both the spinning rust and SSD varieties. Flash drives are a whole subject, just because one…

How much in average can the "" GPU and CPU "" last with good performance?
I have one old computer, one that’s nearly unimaginably out of date, that has been running science calculations as well as formerly having been used as my main computer that dates from 2003 or so. It still runs just fine, but it is so outdated it won’t run anything modern at all. A modern GPU and a modern CPU will, generally speaking, last a couple of decades IF you don’t overclock it or over volt it. Cooling s key. Eventually they’ll die from electro-migration of ions and such in the silicon, but unless too much voltage is applied that is an extremely slow process. Failure of the cooling mechanism or of the power supply is far more likely to eventually kill the CPU or GPU than death by old age.

How high can your HbA1c go?
A1C is a measure of the general glucose available in the blood while a certain blood component is growing. I can’t remember precisely what it is, but it might be the hemoglobin. In any event, it’s a 3 month average, weighted toward the most recent month. I’m not really sure exactly how high it can go, but when I was first diagnosed as Type II diabetic, my A1C was 14.6, and I’ve heard of higher ones. Not sure how high, though. As far as I know, the scale is nearly open-ended, probably terminating at some sort of saturation point where it cannot go higher. I’m not sure about this either, but it could well be that you reach fatal levels before it technically tops out. I’m quite pleased to be able to say that I’m now down to a steady 5.7.

I used to work with a guy who had the same idea, and he just couldn't understand why it wouldn't work, even though I sat down with him and worked out the math in front of him.
His problem seemed to be in his understanding that it takes a lot of torque to drive a useful generator, which of course would cause a lot of drag. Combined with the electrical losses and friction losses, it's a losing proposition. In addition, getting a turbine with a wide enough intake to get enough volume to extract useful energy from would be quite large, and reducing that would get into quite a bit of engineering to handle the airflow. The very last time I heard from him, about 20 years ago, he was trying to source a turbine to hook up to an alternator.

They have great capacity and speed, far superior to any thumb drive I’ve encountered. Get a SSD Enclosure adapter that is made for that physical size of hard drive, usually 2.5″ for most SSDs, put your drive into the enclosure, close it up, plug the USB cable into your computer and it will be an external drive. Being a SSD you won’t need the kind of enclosure that comes with external power, it should work via the USB power quite well. These kits are available inexpensively at most anyplace that sells computer parts, costing $15 or so on up to $30, depending on the bells and whistles included.

Is there some sort of mental illness besides depression that will not let someone find joy in anything?
Yes. Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. Several things can bring it on, from deep depression and a few other mental diseases to side effects of some drugs, such as methamphetamine. In the particular case of methamphetamine, frequent use actually damages the pathways in the brain that register pleasure. Sometimes the effect can be temporary and over time it may rebound to some extent, in more severe cases involving long time addiction it can be permanent. Anhedonia can break the action-reward feedback loop, resulting in varying difficulties with motivation. If you don’t take pleasure in something, why do it, especially if it involves effort? There are two types of anhedonia that I am aware of: physical and social. Social anhedonia, I believe, is more typical, while physical is rarer…

Do shorter Ethernet cables make a difference in gaming?
Shorter Ethernet cables will not make any practical difference in gaming. There is far more latency in the network circuitry than there is in a few kilometers of Ethernet cable. The electrical impulses in Ethernet travel at the velocity of light in copper, minus a tad due to the impedance of the cable. The speed of light in copper in a good cable is roughly 80% of light speed’s 300,000 km/s. A 1 millisecond delay would be somewhere around 240,000 meters of cable, or 240 kilometers. Much much longer than any Ethernet cable could ever be. The maximum channel length of Cat-anything Ethernet is 328 feet, or a tad over 100 meters. Factors internal to the cable such as cross-talk, noise, capacitance, conductor resistance and overall impedance all factor in to limit the practical length of cable. Ke…

Are braided HDMI cables better?
The only thing braided in a braided cable is its exterior covering, usually some sort of braided cloth or other fiber. The interior of HDMI cables are structured in a way so as to allow good quality signals to pass down the cable with minimum cross-talk or attenuation while still being flexible and not straining the wires. Analog signals, such as low-level audio or VGA require better quality wiring because the very fine details of the signals are quite important in that application as they carry the majority of the detail. The signals on HDMI cables are digital, not analog, so the quality of the signal isn’t terribly important as long as it arrives at the other end without any bit-wise errors. The fine details of the signals are unimportant, so spending outlandishly for signal quality is a w…

Does insulin cause a decrease in glucose?
I am not a doctor! Cells use glucose and oxygen together to power their internal machinery. Insulin is a hormone that controls how cells metabolize glucose Speaking very generally so as to avoid getting into cell chemistry, insulin sets the cell up to take glucose in through pathways through it’s cell membrane, reducing the available glucose in the process. A little insulin goes a long way, so a very small amount of insulin can make a significant change in your blood glucose levels. I seem to remember that 1 unit of insulin U100 will account for about 30 points of blood glucose on average. Your mileage may vary significant for a number of reasons. There is also something called insulin resistance, where the body is desensitized to insulin to some degree, requiring larger doses to get the same…

What is the difference between cloning an HDD and copying files?
Cloning a hard drive is the process of making a sector-by-sector duplicate of the original drive, not just a copy of the data. Even the unused portions are copied, which is one way that files may be recovered even though they they were deleted, assuming that the sectors have not been overwritten by new data. Thais is one way that hard drives are forensically examined, by cloning the drive in question and then studying the clone, leaving the original drive in it’s original, unaltered condition. In comparison, making a copy of a hard drive is just that, a copy of the data on the drive. The operating system reads the data from the source hard drive and writes the file data to the new drive, but all the physical details of formatting and layout are not preserved, nor are the contents of empty s…

Is a 500GB hard drive enough for a desktop computer?
Drive capacity entirely depends on what you plan to do with your desktop and how long you plan to keep using it. If it will be used for several years, bump the drive size up one level to account for the sheer level of junk that builds up over time. If you are a casual user, as most people are, just doing your email and some web surfing, making online purchases, maybe doing some light office work, 500 GB would be plenty. If you plan to use your computer for gaming, the size of the drive needed depends on how many games you intend to install. Some of these games can go over 5 GB in size and they can eat up all sorts of extra room with auxiliary files, but unless you have 20 or more of them, I wouldn’t worry about that very much, 500 would be fine, though I would suggest a SSD for speed.

How do you slow your racing mind? What strategy has actually helped you?
It depends on how and why your mind is racing. There can be a wide variety of issues and sometimes more than one issue can work together to cause a problem when they aren’t a problem on their own. Since you are asking about it I will assume that these thoughts are either causing you a problem, or are unpleasant, or both. When your mind is constantly racing, the very first thing to do is cut back on the stimulants. Tea and coffee can be problematic if you drink more than a cup or two in a day.

Also, the current limit on the stack is going to be the current limit on the lowest-power device in the stack. Don’t forget to subtract the combined voltages of the Zeners from the supply voltage when determining the current-limiting resistance.
As Jonathan Morrish said, consider a monolithic reference device if you’re having to stack Zeners. It will likely be more stable and accurate, and won’t take up all the real estate.
Of course, if it’s a one-off use and you already have the Zeners on-hand, it will work, I’ve done it a couple of times when breadboarding.

What are the first flows in a wire between current and voltage?
That’s an interesting question. An electronics-related newsgroup that I belong to posited this questing a while back in a slightly different form and there was no real agreement. I think that the way this is phrased lends itself to the basic response of “Only current flows, voltage is what makes the current flow”. What I think is actually being asked is which comes first, the voltage or the current? I have to say that to my mind it depends on the circumstances. If the circuit is driven by a battery or some other electron source, as far as I am concerned the voltage comes first because of the electron source creating the voltage field that causes the current to begin. However, in the case of an induced current, as in magnetic induction, I think that the current comes first as the lines of force…

The direct answer is NO. You could, but please don’t! It’s not safe and will destroy the iron and probably be dangerous to yourself. The soldering irons with the 5 or 6 prong round plugs are temperature-controlled soldering irons. The two/three wires in the wall plug power the primary side of the internal transformer though the on/off switch. The secondary(s) on the transformer powers the control unit as well as the heating element in the iron. The temperature sensor in the iron provides the controller electronics, making this a (ta-da!) closed-loop control system. The leads generally are: 2 for the power to the heating element 2 for the temperature-sensing element 1 for the tip ground Possibly other pins for other functions or redundancy.

Can I replace a 20 amp circuit breaker with a 30 amp on generator that has a 30-amp receptacle?
The current capacity of the receptacle doesn’t matter in this case, what matters is the output capacity of the generator itself.
It is a very bad idea to increase the rating of the breaker over what it is designed for. A generator has a maximum Wattage which it can output, beyond this capacity, it will not be able to keep up with the demand.
Best case scenario if the generator is overloaded is that it will not be able to produce enough voltage to keep up with the current demand, a condition called voltage sag, or brown-out.
Worst case scenario is that the generator catches on fire due to the overload on the wiring.
Be safe, don’t make the substitution. Order the correct part.

The depressive episodes can be just as bad as a Bipolar I depressive episode, but the manic phase only rises to hypomania.
I *think* that mixed episodes, where some symptoms of hypomania and depression are both present, are more common in Bipolar II individuals, but I am not certain of that.
The timing of the cycles is highly individual and some individuals seem to have no set cycle.

How do increase the upper cut off frequency of an op-amp, if gain is 400-500?
As the Gain Bandwidth Product (GBP) (the result of multiplying the Gain at a particular frequency of an op-amp by it’s bandwidth at a that frequency) of an op-amp is dictated by it’s design and manufacturing process, there are really only two things that can be done when you are up against the GBP limitations of an op-amp. Either break up the amplifier into multiple stages or use a different op-amp, either of which may have drawbacks in your individual situation. The harder a GBP is pushed on a particular application, the more distortion and instabilities will tend to happen. Plus, very high-gain stages are very, very unforgiving with their physical layouts. Lower amplification per stage is much more forgiving. Also, gain drops off rapidly as the bandwidth is pushed. When using the currentl…

Is breadboard analog or digital?
Breadboarding is a useful temporary construction method that can be done in several differect different ways. The particular method you choose chosen affects the type of circuits you can make.¶

In general, breadboarding works for both analog and digital circuits, but with some caveats. High speed or high frequency circuits require more specialized techniques than the common protoboard or perfboard techniques.¶

In particular, the ever-popular (at least among beginning or casual hobbyists) 5-hole protoboard has closely spaced parallel conductors under the surface that provide the connectivity between the holes. The These spaced conductors will act as small capacitors between each row. For low frequency or low speed circuitry that is not an issue, but as frequencies or speeds increase the inter-row capacitance starts affecting the operation of the circuit by first degrading performance and eventually making it unreliable or even completely nonfunctional. A few KHz is the most you can reasonably expect from this method.¶

Perfboard construction does not suffer from the inter-row capacitance issue, but it often suffers from longer connection paths that, at higher speeds or frequencies, can bring other factors like self inductance into play, with negative results. It Perfboard can achieve significantly higher speeds and frequencies than the protoboard. A good many Many MHz are possible with this technique if proper care is taken in construction.¶

What I personally find to be the most difficult breadboarding technique is the so-called “dead bug” method. This is where components are soldered directly to other components, eliminating lead length as a source of error. Such construction is quite compact, but very difficult to modify. I have seen people get good 20 ps pico-second pulses with decent waveforms this way.¶

To the best of my knowledge, dead bug doesn't have the speed issues that the other two techniques I mentioned, but it still has significant drawbacks over more permanent means of construction.¶

construction. As an example, I cannot readily think of any way to make more than the simplest parallel connections such as a bus.¶

This was just intended as a quick overview of some of the techniques and issues, maybe someone who has a keyboard can expound on this at length. I will try to revisit this answer when I get to my computer.issues and in no way is intended to be a general overview of breadboarding, which can be a complex subject.

Is bipolar disorder even a mental illness that all? My parents say that if I take medication, I am not mentally ill ""like someone with schizophrenia"".
Medications taken for bipolar disorder do not cure the disorder, they only help to manage the symptoms to some degree. The symptomatic management of something such as bipolar disorder is somewhat akin to a diabetic who takes insulin to manage their diabetes. Someone taking insulin is still diabetic, they are not “cured” in any way. The same is true of taking medication for bipolar disorder, the underlying condition still exists.

If you are far away enough from the source so that the radiation is unable to reach you, I would think that you haven't yet been exposed. I would assume that the exposure would start when the radiation first encounters any portion of your body.
Heat is electromagnetic radiation. Not nuclear radiation, which is what I think you were thinking of when you mentioned eliminating radiation. Gamma rays are photonic in nature, so they should meet that particular definition of heat, they are similar in nature to infra-red, the most common carrier of energy that we think of as heat, just far, far higher in frequency and therefore energy. Are you thinking of another definition for heat?

What are some good crafts to make with toddlers?
Toddlers are easily entertained just not for very long! It's best to have things set up and ready to go but I'm never that organized. Washable paint - Paint with fingers, paint with brushes, cut up some clean sponges (into shapes if you're feeling industrious) and dip the sponges into the paint. Stamps - Stamps and an ink pad are always a hit. Glue- Print their name in glue on a piece of construction paper. Then they can stick marshmallows/cotton/etc to the glue and 'make' their name. Threading: Toddlers can thread cheerios or colorful straws (that you've cut into pieces) onto pipe cleaners. Twist it into a bracelet. Use painter's tape to make a design on craft paper. Let your little one paint all over the paper. While the paint is still wet carefully remove the tape to show the design - grea…

No one tells you that sometimes these wonderful bundles of magic suck. Their dispositions can be bad and taking care of them is a lot of work - emotional work, financial work, manual work. Dude, it's a lot. Many long days will be spent trying to wipe up their bodily fluids before those same bodily fluids end up being wiped up on you. That right there can be a whole day. It isn't one long joy fest of parenting. It's a lot (if you're lucky) of little moments that make it profound.

For a 16-year-old 5’1 female, is 3000 calories a day enough/too much for anorexia recovery?
You need to consult a doctor. There’s way too much missing information (how much weight needs to be restored, what the current calorie intake is, current blood count levels to make sure the body is healthy enough to endure the drastic change).
Weight restoration can be dangerous, as it’s a shock to the anorexic body’s system. Please seek help.

In the case of sibling abuse what age difference between brothers qualified an act as abuse? If a child is forced into sex by a sibling 3 years older is it abuse?
In the US, legally three or more years is considered legally abusive. However, force is force and there are plenty of cases of younger siblings abusing older siblings that are just as damaging.

If someone was sexually abused as a child, but never realized they were, because they thought it was part of growing up, or for whatever other notion they had in their head, would it still affect them psychologically?
This is actually very common. Growing up I thought a lot of people’s dads were having sex with them they just hid it like I did. I still showed symptoms of a very damaged child from a young age. Child abuse is damaging because it’s horribly traumatic, not because the child doesn’t know any better.

Thank you, this is really validating to hear. Most therapists I hear from seem very “the patient shouldn’t become dependent on the therapist at all” and “there should be a set time limit for therapy.” For me, because I was never able to trust an adult or form healthy relationships, my relationship with my therapist has become a big learning experience in how to attach and heal from what happened with someone who is kind of a maternal figure. I understand it’s not right for everyone, or even most people, but it’s been life saving for me.

Which psychotherapy method was absolutely wrong for you and why?
So, as background information, I was severely abused sexually, physically, and emotionally as a child and early adolescent, as well as neglected. I struggled with self harm, suicidality, anorexia, and C-PTSD as well as a dissociative disorder. I was finally removed from my parents custody and placed in a succession of group homes and residential treatment centers. Most of them employed CBT and DBT and they were incredibly ineffective for me. My issues went well beyond depression and anxiety, and the frequency and duration of treatment was never sufficient. Because of my trust and attachment issues, I wasn’t able to open up to a therapist enough to process what happened to me. After 12 years of most every therapy I can think of (including EMDR, my therapist says that’s more for people to resolve a single or couple instance trauma which is why it didn’t work for me), I very skeptically entered psychodynamic/psychoanalytic therapy. I see my therapist four times a week, which for most people is extreme. However, as someone who couldn’t get out of bed and was repeatedly hospitalized, it was the support I needed to trust someone enough to process what happened. The content was also so upsetting that the frequency gives me the support needed to sit with it. It hasn’t been a quick fix at all, it’s been incredibly frustrating. 14 months in I’m not “cured” but I’m leaps and bounds from where I started, and so much better than the previous 11 years of mostly CBT and DBT combined. I am about to graduate from college, I’m in a healthy relationship, and haven’t self harmed or engaged in eating disordered behaviors in over eight months. I’m so grateful I’ve found a solution, because for so long things were hopeless for me.

Have you ever been sexually assaulted by your partner, and if so did you stay with that person despite them doing so?
My partner has had sex with me while I was under the influence, or on ambien and completely passed out after I asked him not to. I’m a survivor of severe sexual abuse and currently am not able to have sex and he gets frustrated. It’s messed up but it’s a complicated situation and I’m still with him.

What are the best ways for me to reduce my anxiety while writing, using healthy coping mechanisms (no alcohol or drugs, prescription or otherwise)?
Exercise has been crucial for me! I know it is sometimes really hard to go out and be active when panicking but it can really help. Yoga has been so helpful for me in gently getting stress out of my body and learning to breathe and be mindful. I’m lucky enough to live in the mountains so hiking is a great outlet. I’m trying to teach myself to snowboard, which is a good outlet and learning new things can be really helpful. If this isn’t an option try to get outside when you can or maybe try channeling your energy into something new! I have a friend who is teaching herself guitar and it’s helping her anxiety a lot.

What supplements do I take for anorexia recovery?
Things that have been helpful for me are fish oil and a multivitamin and I would buy a lot of Boost. It tastes gross but it’s reallt helpful for calorie restore.
Most importantly, go to a doctor. They can be incredibly helpful and sometimes medication can help with recovery. They can also refer you to a therapist which will be crucial to your recovery.
If health care isn’t an option right now, supplements like Kava Kava and Valerian root can help with anxiety.

I genuinely don’t think there’s a correlation, it’s more of a stereotype. Both of my abusers were good looking, “likable”, successful people. It allows them to blend in and get away with it.

How can I forget old of child abuse memories completely? See details.
I am so sorry this happened to you. There is no way to forget the memories. Please go to a therapist. There are many kinds of therapy that can help you heal from this and resolve the shameful feelings. One in particular that is a relatively brief and efficient therapy where you don't have to talk about the trauma if you don't want (I've never tried but have heard good things, especially in regard to symptom relief) is EMDR. I would look up EMDR therapists in your area and visit a few to find a good fit.

How does being molested as a child affect adult romantic relationships and loyalty to a partner?
In pretty much every way possible. My partner is the most gentle man I've ever met, has never pressured me into intimacy, etc. However, the closer we've gotten emotionally, the more difficult it is for me to be physically intimate with him. When he is affectionate towards me, my brain often confuses him with my abuser. We've had to take a sexual break because every time we are intimate I disassociate for about a day, and then have a horrible flashback/panic attack. Other times I feel irrationally angry at him, and don't understand if he loved me why he'd want to have sex with me. I'm constantly doubting his motivations, I've become very scared of him, I am no longer able to be emotionally vulnerable with him, etc. It really scares me that he needs me (emotionally, physically, whatever way).…

Thank you that's good to know. I had some when I was in state custody who were kind of voyeuristic, and two that took my dad’s side which was incredibly invalidating and harmful. I've also had some therapists that were very uncomfortable hearing about what happened. But she is Very validating, very invested in building the relationship before we talk about the hard things, helps explain how my brain is working, etc. also I can usually weasel around therapists but she's smart and doesn't let me get away with that sort of thing. So it seems promising at least.

Great, thank you. I think a lot of it is trying to speed up building the relationship so I feel safe enough to talk. I was taken out of my home by CPS as a teenager, and put in various group homes with not great therapy until I turned 18. I got a scholarship to college and pushed it all down but still kind of coped unhealthily. I had a series of therapists who kind of made it worse. I finally found a therapist I trusted and who helped me stabilize, but it was pretty hard when she quit. This current therapist specializes in trauma, and she has had several internships at trauma centers. She really seems like she knows what she's doing, it's just that after some of the stuff that's happened to me, I doubt if I can trust my own perceptions. It feels helpful to me, and I'm finally at the point of my life where I can't avoid it any longer, or “deal with it” by myself.

I feel like it's the amount of help I need right now, and that she's worked really hard to rearrange her schedule so that she can fit me in. As for more info - Last month my previous therapist I was very attached to quit her practice very unexpectedly, my abusive family did some pretty messed up things and completely disowned me, I got into a not great relationship where I had sex for the first time as an adult (several times) which really messed me up and triggered me more than I thought it would and really sent me into a spiral. Then the same SO got put in the psych ward for bipolar 2 which was really out of the blue. I've relapsed with my eating disorder and I've never processed my trauma, but it's gotten to the point where I can't really function the flashbacks and insomnia are so bad.

Thank you so much. I've had some pretty bad therapy before and due to life stressors in the last two months (former therapist of many years quitting, getting disowned by my abusive family, SO getting hospitalized out of the blue, as well as being in a relationship where physical intimacy was expected…. I kind of lost it) it's really hard to get through most days. I just want to get better so bad but I don't know if I'm going about it the right way.

Are there certain ways a fever is triggered when you have anorexia nervosa?
It's not so much that anorexia triggers fevers as it is that anorexia leads to a severely weakened immune system. Thus, whenever someone around her is sick she is much more at risk to get sick than healthy people are. Her body cannot combat germs and illness like other bodies can. Her body is so focused on using the few resources it has to stay functioning that it can't devote any time to fighting off illness. The only way to fix it is to recover from the eating disorder and regain the weight. I know this is a very difficult answer but it's the only way.

Anorexia is complete hell. Your body is so weak that you never want to go anywhere. I would faint and sometimes my legs would give in because I was so weak.

My hair fell out so much that I would avoid taking showers because I would be in the shower so long trying to clean up all of the hair. I could only wear one pair of jeans because they were the only pair that fit me. When I put on my old jeans they slid off my body. I never had any clothes to wear but all I cared about was the size.

No. I had much more acne when I was an anorexic. My immune system was messed up and my hormones were imbalanced because I had lost my period.

Why do abusive parents act nicely around other people and sometimes act/display abusive behavior towards their child/children?
My father is also very abusive and did the same thing growing up. Around town he was the model father, a stand up guy. Everyone loves him. Behind closed doors he's a completely different person. When my abuse was reported to the police it was hard for a lot of people to believe me because in their minds he was such a great guy. It's all about control. They won't get in trouble if no one believes their victims and they can continue to be accepted and loved by society while always having an outlet for their rage.

How do adults abused as children act?
I certainly think that anyone that is abused as a child is effected as an adult in certain ways, though factors such as personality and the extent of the abuse will dictate how they act. For me my social skills were very much damaged because my first intimate social interactions were extremely negative. Even though I have worked through much of my trauma I am still very introverted and have a very hard time having relationships with people unless they earn my trust. I also have a tendency to always worry that the other shoe will drop and something will change in the relationship and the other person will hurt me. Relationships aren't impossible but the other person must be supportive and patient. I think like everything it's a combination of nurture and nature. I've always been told I'm a…

How do you communicate with someone whose been abused/traumatized?
Just how you'd communicate with anyone else. Help them to feel safe and valued. Validate their experiences and express that you are sorry for what they've been through. Let them go at their own pace in the relationship. It can often be very triggering for abuse survivors to be around very controlling or angry people, so try to refrain from being that way.
More than anything an abuse survivor needs a kind, patient, loving person who is consistently there. You won't say everything perfectly, but try to be empathetic, kind and patient and you will help.

far from wrong I was a mistress me and the married man were so compatible in every way, there was a strong connection, he spoke very highly about his family and the wife the mother of his kids, and guess what there was never never ever sexual activity or money exchange or never promised me any thing only a comfort to talk to a person who understood him, hell yes there was a physical attraction and all but we were two adults who understood there is no point in hurting either party

YES I suffer from that and I refuse to take laxatives or any thing I do suffer from IBD, what helps is 1/2 glass of boiling water and squezzing lemon in the water drinking it first thing in the morning wait 20 minutes then eat as usual
another way is take a table spoon olive oil by mouth first thing in the morning wait 20 minutes and have your breakfast
another way is I eat papaya and kiwi fruit that guarantee to go
dates or prunes also

This boy told me he liked me. About a month later we started dating. This is when I find out that 2 days after he told me he liked me, he hung out with and kissed another girl. He’s apologized but I can’t seem to forgive. What do I do?
easy get rid of him, already a sign of CHEATING, and trust issues at least he did it early in the relationship and not 4 years later

How do you get over a relationship that ended because the family wouldn't accept it? Everything else was perfect otherwise, and they broke up only because they put family first.
EXACTLY what happened to me, he moved on mummy chose a nice girl for him and yes he married her and had a baby,

I disagree because you don't have sex to make up you need to first talk about the problem so the issue can get solved so it doesn't happen again and then have sex and do what you went, me and my ex used sex for everything the problems just escalated no issues were solved so where are we now SEX IS NOT THE ANSWER

I totally agree with you Roxana, couldn't have said it better, its not to be used as a punishment, how can you even enjoy the moment when he has shattered or upset you so much, when we make love we make it for a reason because you love your partner and content with where you are in life, we don't do it when we are tortured or upset and just make love and everything is alright....... that's why there are brothels were we have no feelings or emotions are attached

far from wrong I was a mistress me and the married man were so compatible in every way, there was a strong connection, he spoke very highly about his family and the wife the mother of his kids, and guess what there was never never ever sexual activity or money exchange or never promised me any thing only a comfort to talk to a person who understood him, hell yes there was a physical attraction and all but we were two adults who understood there is no point in hurting either party

I totally agree with you Roxana, couldn't have said it better, its not to be used as a punishment, how can you even enjoy the moment when he has shattered or upset you so much, when we make love we make it for a reason because you love your partner and content with where you are in life, we don't do it when we are tortured or upset and just make love and everything is alright....... that's why there are brothels were we have no feelings or emotions are attached

I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!

What has been the most gruesome real footage you've ever seen?
Hi. Let me tell you the story of Tatiane Spitzner and how her recorded death shocked the world and opened many eyes to what exactly domestic violence looks like. Tatiane was a 29-year-old lawyer who lived with her husband Luis Filipe in Guarapuava. Looking at pictures of the couple they looked like a happy and deeply in love couple: But behind these pictures hid a truly shocking reality that ended in a horrific way. On the 22nd of July, 2018, the couple went to a party and when they returned (at around 2:30 AM) they can be seen on CCTV parked in front of their building. They spoke for a little bit and then he suddenly hit her thrice, with considerable strength, in the head. She then tried to run and opened the door, but he forced her to close it and put her seatbelt around her neck, while grabbing her by the hair and punching her head repeatedly. Then they drove to the garage, he parked the car, got out, dragged her out and pushed her against the car. He then punched her throat causing her to pass out and fall to the ground. As she laid there he parked his car and two minutes later he came back and started kicking her until she woke up and got up. When she started regaining consciousness she decided to run for her life and she started running towards the elevator as he chased her. They both managed to get inside the elevator and she clicked the ground floor button instead of the fourth floor where they lived. When the elevator opened on the ground floor she tried to run, and managed to get out but he grabbed her and forced her back inside grabbing her and putting her against the wall until the door closed again. When they got to the fourth floor she put her hands on the sides of the elevator to try and stop him from forcing her to get out, but to no avail. When they left the elevator, it was the last time Tatiane was seen alive. When they got to their apartment, the neighbours heard her cries for help but did nothing. Less than 15 minutes later the camera outside the building filmed her body falling onto the floor. He claimed that she jumped by herself, but it's clear that's a lie because in the video we can see that she was not trying to block her face or even screaming. She was lifeless when she fell. He came downstairs, picked her up and took her to the elevator where he, covered in her blood, started to caress her face and covered her breasts. He took her back to their apartment and then came back and cleaned the blood from the elevator, before driving away. Dunia Rampazzo, a prosecutor on the case, stated: Our investigation proves that the victim was killed inside the apartment by asphyxiation and her body was thrown over the balcony of the apartment. We believe the accused then took the elevator to the ground floor and collected Tatiane’s body, taking it back up to the apartment in the elevator. We suspect that before she was killed, Luis subjected his wife to a prolonged period of violent physical aggression. This was not a suicide, but femicide. The aggressor then attempted to escape by car. The case had multiple delays due to covid, but in May this year, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. If you know someone who has an abusive partner or if you're in such a relationship, get help. Her death cannot be in vain, and it'll hopefully inspire those who need the inspiration to get out while they can. Thank you for reading.

My Zoe adopted me 2years ago when I moved into my apartment her previous owner wanted to put her down because she couldn't take her with her when she moved out, so I moved in with Zoe.
Zoe and I get on well she enjoys her space. Problem is Zoe doesn't allow me to sleep late. I wake up every morning at 5h30 and feed her get ready for work and leave at 7h00, if I get back into bed on a morning that I don't have to go to work she brings home birds she catches or she jumps on top of me meowing licking or biting me until I eventually give up and get out of bed. If I decide to take a nap infront of the TV she does the same.
How do I get Zoe to let me sleep late?

Thanks for the clarification. I was also wondering why they yelled at me to get off the floor when I was extremely ill. I had an awful fracture on my lower back and after 5 hours I could NOT sit in the hard chairs. So chairs any longer. I was out of my mind in pain but they didn’t care and I kept it to myself because there was nothing they were going to do. I just thought a different position would help even though yes, it was probably terribly unsanitary. I didn’t care. I just got on the floor. What can they do besides yell They yelled at you?me of course but I countered if you have a better solution I’m all ears. They didn’t.

Sadly I witnessed both. I was in a horrible hospital while in college dealing with breaking my arm and there was this psychotic woman having an huge break. Instead of treating her they just injected her with a bunch off different drugs until she stopped yelling. I interned in a psych ward before and I knew this was the completely wrong protocol! No restraints or watching her on camera. A few hours later the same staff tried waking her up for breakfast and she wouldn’t move. They kept yelling to get up but I knew the first time. It was really sad especially that none of these people were held accountable.

I don’t think anyone gets to judge Marilyn Monroe unless you lived her life and walked in her shoes. Her mother was mentally unstable causing her aunt to care for her. When she finally made a life for herself from modeling to acting, most men, directors mostly, took advantage of her and didn’t pay her anything near what she deserved compared to her men counterparts. Most deserved in diamonds is a girls best friend. Marilyn never even got paid for being playboy of the year. She paid for her mother to receive the best care. It’s not talked about often, but she inherited her mother’s mental illness as well and was suicidal about it. She took a lot of pills and alcohol which is how she passed. Albeit whatever allegations about the dirty dishes and IBS, where were the maids to take care of the dishes and sheets?

Have you ever been rude to someone and thought that you were right in doing so?
Not sure if it is considered rude. I Just responded in kind. This was several decades ago. As a child, and into my mid twenties I was naturally very skinny. Not underweight but skinny. Well, one day, I was coming home from work. I was about 22 years old or so.. This overweight woman, with moles on her face, about 50 or so, says to me-""You are so skinny, you need to eat something. You would look so much better with some meat on your bones.” Mind you, I worked at a restaurant at that time. I ate 2 meals there everyday. I had bacon and eggs, and for lunch I had fish, and pasta. And-I was going to have dinner later, at home So, her comment was ridiculous. I was just a skinny healthy 22 year old, who was naturally skinny. How I miss those days! Well, I lost it with her. I said- ""You should really lose some weight. You should eat less. You would look so much better with some meat off your bones. You should have those moles on your face checked, and removed, you would look better. Are we done exchanging advice complete stranger?” She just sat on the bench and gawked at me. The bus arrived, and she got on first and sat in the front. As, I got on, the bus, the handsome bus driver looks at me and says, you're a pretty girl. A boy about my age smiles at me. The big lady, heard the bus driver, and saw the youngman smile at me. I was just a skinny, 22 year-old in blue jeans and a Tee-Shirt, and no makeup. As I walked by the advice lady when I got off the bus. I smiled at her, and said you have a great day now. She rolled her eyes, and didn't respond. I was a bit harsh, with her, but, her commenting negatively on my personal appearance, was just inappropriate. Her making an inaccurate asumption, that I didn't eat, and telling me what I need to do, was, hurtful,, and disrespectful. I know she thought twice about what she said to people after that.

What are you talking about? Anorexia definitely is otherwise they wouldn’t consult psych in the first place. According to the dsm it is definitely a psychiatric condition. I’m not talking about appetite loss. I’m talking about being a small person already who has severe weight loss. That raises eyebrows unfortunately that strays away from my main medical issues. My doctor typical will not prescribe pain medication because it creates nausea.

It’s a joke for me. I’ve suffered for years with documented GI problems however whenever I show up to the er it’s a hit or miss situation. Sometimes they give me what I need other times they won’t. With my condition it also causes a lot of weight loss so they love to throw in a psych diagnosis of anorexia.

I get it. I have a GI condition that makes it impossible for me to keep food down. As a result, I lose weight and have to get rehydrated through iv. The last time I was in the hospital they didn’t do anything but ask for a psych evaluation for an eating disorder. I was genuinely angry.

Typically you won’t. Doctors are highly against prescribing it due to it being addictive. You have to have a doctor for a long time like 10 years to have it.

Personally, I’ve never had this issue happen to me but I’ve seen it firsthand and it’s just abhorrent. I spend a certain amount of money in certain retailers and it definitely makes me uncomfortable. I think twice about where I spend my hard earned money after experiencing this no matter the brand.

It might be cheaper however depending on numerous factors such as taking into account how long the flight is- I’d say 8 hours or more, which airline it is, certain amenities, most importantly if you have medical conditions where you just cannot sit straight for hours on end. Some things you can’t put a price on. I’m not an extremist and say blow $20k for emirates but a practical price especially if you have the capability to use mileage to upgrade.

It’s hard to pick one.. I recently had a tech picking on me. I don’t know why she didn’t like me but she was a straight up bully. I have serious GI issues such as gastroparesis which constantly flares and causes extreme vomiting. When I was admitted to the er I went to the bathroom and all of a sudden she starts banging on the door telling me to get out. I was literally hovering over the toilet saying lady don’t F&ck with me. I’ve never been more furious in my life. I ended up reporting her to hr. I’ll find out later what happened.

I’m 5’4 85 but I’ve always been considered very short and petite. I have a digestive issue so I can’t really eat regular. I never have. My doctors told me to try to do 6 small in stead of 3 large but I couldn’t do that. I got sick drinking endure. It’s gotten worse over the past 7 years to wear even swallowing is painful.

I’m trying to figure out if my mom has dementia or a “selective memory”. She does not use I statements, take any accountability for mistakes made on her part, however Will apologize with complete sarcasm and turn the tables. I don’t even consider them mistakes at this point. It’s was pure negligence in my case letting me go so long without physical care because school was more important. Yes I graduated high school at the top of my class getting all A’s. Yes I went to an Ivy League. But at what cost? I am 31 have severe kidney failure, osteoporosis, gastroparesis, etc, because as a kid she refused to listen to me if something was wrong. “Yes I was making up all my ailments as early as 3 years old” if anything I can stay it made me stronger to deal with such a person like that from the start.

I have gastroparesis which includes several trips to er due to flare ups. There is no cure and many people are not educated on it. I once had an admission and could not stop vomiting and while vomiting the dr said I must like attention. I was really angry and still am. I haven’t forgotten that. You can’t cause this but shame on medical professionals who don’t act professional.

As a patient, what's the angriest you have ever been toward a doctor?
Oh so many to count: * The doctor who assumed my swollen face and rash was from makeup and he literally took a coffee break while I sat waiting. Turns out it was a severe reaction to a spider bite. Figured that one out when my throat swelled shut and I couldn’t breathe. * The doctor who literally rolled his eyes when I was trying to describe severe gut pain. He thought it was “just a bug”. Turns out it was an acute pancreatitis attack. It took 8 doctors and 8–1/2 months to get a proper diagnosis because every doctor dismissed my pain and description of symptoms. * The doctor who told me “I was just a slow healer” when I described continuing severe pain after my total knee replacement. A year later a new doctor diagnosed the problem: It’d torn a tendon during physical therapy. My knee swung back and forth sideways like a clock pendulum. I had to have a second total knee replacement because the damage had healed and couldn’t be repaired any other way. * The ER doctor who was killing time until retirement so often went to breakfast, leaving patients to wait. I was peeing blood. He was eating eggs and bacon at a nearby diner. * The gynecologist who told me I had a “swollen ovary” and to wait 2–3 months even though the pain was so bad I couldn’t even stand up straight. Turned out to be a grapefruit-sized tumor that had caused ovarian torsion (twisted fallopian tube). The doctor who believed me and agreed to a “second opinion” examination wouldn’t even let me leave. They wheeled me across the parking lot directly into surgery. He said the tumor was so close to rupturing I could easily have died. There are probably millions of stories in the US about dismissive, arrogant, incompetent doctors. Especially for women. US doctors are notorious for not listening to women.

I had the same experience. My ex and I were together for 10 years. He had 3 kids but his eldest was completely nefarious. He promised that went she went away to college things would change but they never did. She treated her own blood family like garbage even though they paid for everything but not including she already had a trust fund. At the end of college it was covid and she started working from home. At that time, I had suffered enough emotionally and psychologically abuse and panic attacks from her narcissism and her nastiness and so did her father because she refused to get her own place. After a period of time and no matter what happened my ex said I might hate her but she’s my daughter I can’t divorce her. That was the end of my relationship.

I can relate to some extent. I have gastroparesis and literally cannot eat or swallow anything anymore so they always accuse me of having anorexia because my weight is really low. Unfortunately the doctors in the hospitals don’t know too well of that stomach disorder so they pretend is psychological and treat me as such. I was just in the hospital for a week vomiting blood and they wouldn’t give me anything for pain or relief. In my situation I’m allergic to haldol, reglan, and I cannot take zofran because of the QT waves. So they literally couldn’t wouldn’t do anything because I refused those meds. I flat out told them they are in my allergy notes for a reason reason. I’m wearing a allergy bracelet for one, and I don’t plan on appeasing anyone by taking them again again and getting really sick like having a heart attack or seizure. But yeah for the most part doctors have way too much power and pride. They rather see you suffer than it be on their hands.hands. I like the term medical gaslighting.

actually I’m allergic to most emetics they cause dystonia. For my episodes they have to knock me out me with something strong through iv. Even though it’s in my notes they just do not understand what gastroparesis is since it’s not common. I hate my hospital. The last time I was there I was kept in the waiting room for 5 hours vomiting non stop until I had a tear and it started eroding. When they admitted finally, this dr I never met came in and the first thing she saw was “I like attention” I couldn’t answer because I was still vomiting. I was so confused but too in pain to be angry at the moment.

I call him a few days later to remind him, he asks who I am which isn’t too surprising because he has a ton of patients, doesn’t take insurance and wants to be paid in cash. We go over my med list for the thousandth time like something has changed. After 7 minutes he says I have to go bye and hangs up on me. I am literally so inconceivably angry I have no words. I don’t mind the money if he actually does something useful. But nothing. He texts he later for a less than a 15 session he wants 175. I text him sometime later after cooling off saying that my needs cannot be met with a session lasting less than 15 minutes. He got upset with that and said well if that’s your situation then maybe you should see another doctor. I had no problem with that. I know he’s just in it for the money considering I had one session where he was getting a facts about one of his patients being incarcerated.
Mainly I was upset because he was committing malpractice and didn’t care. I have severe insomnia and that’s what I needed to talk about more in-depth. The fact of the matter is he didn’t care when I told him I have low blood pressure and he was prescribing me a low blood pressure pill that was making it worse. I kept saying no you can’t do that. I already have low blood pressure and I have been admitted several times. He didn’t care or listen, just said well I’m gonna up the dose. I tried to tell him but he literally would not listen.

Is it normal for a narcissistic mother to be nice one day and the next a horrible person again? Or even just a time space of 1 minute to a few months?
Oh it’s more than normal. That’s how they live. Although I rarely saw my mother “nice” except to other people. I’ll just say quiet for us. We would never make it to months. A few minutes later she would be yelling or criticizing me or my sibling for something completely asinine. We eventually just stopped talking to her. She is a npd fucked up nut job who takes no culpability for any of the horrible things she done. No remorse.

Yeah school was hard. I hate saying “mom” or mother even because it’s too painful so I’ll just say X. She never tried to figure out what was wrong with me even after multiple ER visits.

That’s odd. I’ve never had a problem getting zofran, however I find that it completely ineffective and never helps with my chronic nausea and vomiting.

I have endometriosis and ovarian cysts often. I just turned 30. I tried all the medications in terms of bc I don’t know why because I have no chance of getting pregnant. Even if I did I decided against it. My partner already had kids from a previous marriage and has a vasectomy. No one can convince me to change my mind about a hysterectomy. The pain I go through this often with the no chance of being fertile anyways.. it’s a no brainer. I hope after all this time my doctor will concur.

It’s good to know that in someway, I’m not This might be long but it’s worth the only one at odds with NOT just someone in my family, but a grandparent almost my entire life.read.
Here’s the story:
On my paternal side I had amazing grandparents. They survived WW2 and immigrated to Israel with the rest of their family who survived. Some didn’t make it. The story alone brings so many tears to my face and what they went through. I literally try not to hate anyone but I will Never accept people that do not believe that the holocaust ever happened. I didn’t know my grandma (safta) much as she passed when I was three but I remember her and her memory very well. Her kindness and what little I do remember still brings me joy. My grandfather aka saba was literally the most immeasurable man I ever knew in my life and looked up to. We didn’t talk about it much but one of his brothers was shot to death right in front of him. I couldn’t even imagine how he had the courage to move forward and keep going but he did. To see what he overcame in his stories and lived on to have worked several jobs to support his family and kids despite what happened to him at such a young age is inconceivable. He also was a talented artist, he spoke several languages, up to 5, and he just had a heart of gold. Most of all he was just patient and kind. He unfortunately passed from cancer when I was about 14. He could not be at my bat mitzvah since he was so sick so we streamed it to him and it literally made him light up. The irony is that these are the grandparents that I didn’t get to see very often because they lived in Israel and I live lived in the states. To this day I am still so angry livid at my mom for choosing where we had to live and so is my dad (he is Israeli and that is his homeland)¶

homeland) where all our REAL family lives.¶

Now on maternal side, I never met my grandfather because he died 7 to 8 years before I was born. It was mentioned at some point he didn’t really have the patience for children anyway. My mom doesn’t talk about him too much except that he loved the piano. piano and was very musical. With that being said, I do have a grandmother who is still alive. She is 94 94 but looks 65 65 with all her work done. I could post a picture but I refuse to live in the vapidity. She actually has gotten mistaken for Joan Rivers at the airport before. The Multiple times….The reason I don’t get along with her well is because nepotism. simply nepotism. She has five grandchildren grandchildren, including me, I’m last, and now two new great grandchildren. All she cares about is the almighty dollar. She rates us mainly on how much is in our bank account, what ivy we attended, who we married, etc. Her first born golden boy son is a executive CEO of a multi million dollar company. I’m not going to mention my mom or the other sibling. But the fact of the matter is he’s her first born son had done some pretty bad stuff and felonious things in his childhood that were clearly not within the limits of stealing candy or anything of that nature. Obviously the statue of limitations has run out and I’m not going to say specifically. I’m just going to say it had a HUGE impact and strain on my life. He’s gotten away with it and it, because at an older age he suddenly decided to become pious as ever, donates at least 6 figures to his congregation, she just doesn’t care because all she sees is money. dollar signs. I’ve only seen her maybe 10 times in my entire life and I’m approaching 30 now. When I have seen here they are called “duty visits” because it’s only done because it’s something that she feels she has to do. obligated to do, like a check list. Not because she truly wants to. She only spends time with the grandchildren with the most money. My mother denies this but it is completely true. true considering she even calls them “duty visits”. This one time I had cousins coming down from Chicago at the time and she chose to spend time with them over me. I have a older sister that has cut her out off of her life years ago because all she wants to do is gossip and then spread it around to other family members which is totally not right. Note toxic. As for me, I would prefer it to be that way or keep it on the most basic level. For now it’s not available. I’ve cut my mom out of every doctor appointment, labs, surgery, and as a an emergency contact. I have a ton of medical issues so and as much as I try to keep them private, my mom talks about me all the time even though I keep asking pleading with her not to. For example I was in a I grew up really bad car accident in May. No drugs drinking or speeding. I happened to have mature to begin with, from all of my rather “anomalous” family situations and with my medical conditions. I had really low blood pressure severe nerve damage when I was born that caused several problems I wouldn’t know about until several years later. The only thing I knew I had besides the nerve problem was gastroparesis. It is a stomach condition which caused me to not want to eat anything because I couldn’t digest it correctly. It started out as ARFID (DSM-5) of not wanting food because I would start getting physically sick but eventually evolved into full blown anorexia. I know I can’t blame anyone for it but it certainly didn’t help that the times I did see my grandmother, all of a sudden and my car hit a curb and suddenly it turned over. This was my first accident ever. In 16 she did was fat shame people in front of me. She even told another family member in front of me to not wear shorts anymore because they’re legs did not look good in them. I’ve had multiple treatments and I think it’s something I’m mostly over but the fat shaming is still a big part of my family. Ironically enough, I became a dietitian. My mom did eventually bring it up it up to her several years of driving. I was in my neighborhood and was able to call home on my car phone. Before paramedics arrived. Of course my mom told my grandmother. She didn’t ask if I was ok. Just that I was a really bad driver and don’t think about getting me another car. later and she still denies the correlation between her words and my condition. I feel really bad for saying this even, but I think about it all the time. Why did I lose the best grandparents and she is all I have left? I don’t care about the will whatsoever or anything because I don’t expect to be included. There is no amount of money that could justify anything. I just wish I had my loving grandparents still here.

Is it ethical for a psychiatrist to not show up for a appointment (mind you) he’s in late 80s and still practicing out of his home. I call him a few days later to remind him, he asks who I am which isn’t too surprising because he has a ton of patients, doesn’t take insurance and wants to be paid in cash. We go over my med list for the thousandth time like something has changed. After 7 minutes he says I have to go bye and hangs up on me. I am literally so inconceivably angry I have no words. I don’t mind the money if he actually does something useful. But nothing. He texts he later for a less than a 15 session he wants 175. I text him sometime later after cooling off saying that my needs cannot be met with a session lasting less than 15 minutes. He got upset with that and said well if that’s your situation then maybe you should see another doctor. I had no problem with that. I know he’s just in it for the money considering I had one session where he was getting a facts about one of his patients being incarcerated.
Mainly I was upset because he was committing malpractice and didn’t care. I have severe insomnia and that’s what I needed to talk about more in-depth. The fact of the matter is he didn’t care when I told him I have low blood pressure and he was prescribing me a low blood pressure pill that was making it worse. I kept saying no you can’t do that. I already have low blood pressure and I have been admitted several times. He didn’t care or listen, just said well I’m gonna up the dose. I tried to tell him but he literally would not listen. Could I sue him on that?

After a certain time, no matter how many laxatives magnesium sitrate or enema you give yourself it’s simply will not work. The stool is simply just too hard from being up there from so long and and enema can’t even reach that far. It’s best that you go to the ER to see whether or not you have a bowel impaction. They can see how much fecal matter you have and based on that, treat that rather appropriately and quickly to relieve your discomfort.

My mother was born in the fifties her brother in 49, and the last sibling in in the fifties too. I know back in this time. Fathers really couldn’t go in the room or anything. As far as I know her mother had a nanny or nurse taken care of each child up into a certain age.

You know nothing about trauma or memory. I was 3 years old already having the brink of an eating disorder currently known by the DSM-5 as arfid, which led into full blown anorexia. I remember being at relatives house and my dad broke something, knowing about my college fund I begged them not to take it from there.

I too have had a unpleasant experience with a nurse or two. A was having neck spasms with extreme pain causing it too be completely stiff to one side. My neck was twisted to one side either completely left or right at the time and it would budge. It looked pretty odd not to mention the agony I was going through WITHOUT pain meds at the time. The nurse on my shift was literally treating me as if it was fake and that I could move my neck. She kept asking me, rudely, to move my neck to the proper position forward and this I could not do. I remember I got really thirsty and could barely reach what little water there was. When I did grasp the cup I was drinking sideways and I started aspirating, and she didn’t respond. Another nurse checked on me and helped. I literally counted the hours, actually minutes until the nurse changed shifts. I finally got a muscle relaxer that relieved the nerve pain and stiffness. I found out later that the neck condition was caused by an allergic reaction to medication causing a condition known as cervical dysontia. Anyways yes some nurses are just nasty and shouldn’t be nurses.

I understand it’s important to have everything to be cleaned out which is why they give you that big jug and peg solution however I was wondering if it was necessary to drink it all especially if you only weigh a certain weight and cannot tolerate a certain amount of food or fluids without being ill.
asking this question was because most of the time I don’t or I really can’t eat anything because of my Gastro situation. If I do eat it’s mainline liquid and that’s it or some thing really low caloric like fruit so grapes or cherries. Less than 1/4 cup, if that. I really can’t eat without getting violently sick. I feel better for my stomach when I don’t eat because there’s no vomiting or anything like that. I’m still very young towards my late 20s and my doctor hasn’t given me a reason why I need to have a colonoscopy albeit, I’ve done several endoscopy's. i’m struggling to find the urgency for this. Why is it so important if I’m so young. Yes I have a lot of G.I. issues but i’ve never heard of a colonoscopy being able to fix anything. I know I don’t have polyps or anything like that. I’m just mainly wondering what I can expect out of this.

Why am I not losing weight like I did previously? I’m a late 20s female. Nothing has changed. I’ve always been thin, petite, and been able to lose weight quickly. In addition, I have not been able to exercise in a few years because I have osteoporosis. I have severe GI problems that limits so many foods, that eating is just so unpleasant. Last year I went down from 98 to 85 in 2 1/2 months or less. I started at 96 this time a week or so ago and I’m only down to 92. It’s not a race I just want to know why I’m not losing when I’m not really eating anything.

What ingredients should we have in our toothpaste?
The most important ingredient in your toothpaste is called fluoride. It protects and builds enamel on your teeth. You will also find potassium nitrate, which helps reduce tooth sensitivity. Other important ingredients include pyrophosphates and triclosan. These reduce tartar, gingivitis, and bad breath. As your dentist will tell you, these ingredients are crucial to effective dental care. They will help you maintain healthy teeth between your dental exams and teeth cleanings.

I mean, I hid my meth addiction from my boyfriend who I lived with for 2 whole years before I finally broke down and told him.
He said he had no idea, but that he wasn’t exactly that surprised when he thinks back about how I was always so energetic, able to work 3 jobs without a complaint, and how little sleep I needed to function normally compared to most people… lol.
So, unless you’ve been smoking it around him or being blatantly and obviously tweaked out, maybe he just thinks you have a quirky personality 🤷🏻‍♀️

True. I have also seen marijuana, alcohol, acid and cocaine trigger schizophrenia in people who were predisposed, as well.

Wait. So, you’re saying that not everybody acts this way in these types of situations???
For the most part, I honestly kind of just assumed this was normal breakup behaviour lol…. Oh dear.

You are literally the reason why so many people wait FAR too long to get help when they might desperately need it.

I have been trying to figure out why I am the way I am my entire life. Constantly trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Or if there even is anything actually wrong with me. Maybe I’m just more weak, less adequate, less worthy of a person than most.
I relate pretty heavily to every single one of these. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember so I was confused at first, because I just considered them my norm… even though my norm also consists of knowing that these traits make me feel the very opposite of “normal”.
Anyway. It was oddly comforting to read this list, written by someone else, when it feels like it could have come from my brain. Thank you for taking the time to write it.

Is it unfair of me to feel frustrated about having my boyfriend's friend (who is known for pathologically lying in the past) stay on our couch indefinitely, rent free, in our already cramped basement suite?

Well.. I'm not sure the feedback part applies to new features beecause that's (tinder & co) already an established business that can't just take advice from anyone… hence my suggestion for a totally new app… I get your point though, thanks for sharing your opinion.

It’s only been a week for me but I already feel like I have a huge weight lifted off my shoulders .. for some reason I keep thinking about him and blaming myself for the downfalls in our relationship although I know I tried my hardest to make him happy it was truely impossible to do … no appreciation for anything I ever did … just expected it and it still was never good enough
