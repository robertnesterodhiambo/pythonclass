perfect answer, I totally agree its never the other person its the person who your married to, the man must have promised her so much for him to act in a certain way how do I know because I have been through it my self……………. he promised me the world then I said to him show me I want action not just saying things verbally, the next day I never heard from him

you have a break when your dating but I don't believe that's right to say he wants a break from marriage, communicate with him on a higher level and ask for more clarification , what this all means to him

far from wrong I was a mistress me and the married man were so compatible in every way, there was a strong connection, he spoke very highly about his family and the wife the mother of his kids, and guess what there was never never ever sexual activity or money exchange or never promised me any thing only a comfort to talk to a person who understood him, hell yes there was a physical attraction and all but we were two adults who understood there is no point in hurting either party

AMEN somebody said, a man will truly marry you if he loves you and wants to commit to you, when men use financial reasons or family reasons to me that's a total lie, how hard can it be either you want to be with someone or not

I agree in someway I think marriage is a commitment between a couple and If you believe in god its also making that commitment in front of GOD . these days any one can live with any one but it does feel special when you have that special commitment

YES I suffer from that and I refuse to take laxatives or any thing I do suffer from IBD, what helps is 1/2 glass of boiling water and squezzing lemon in the water drinking it first thing in the morning wait 20 minutes then eat as usual
another way is take a table spoon olive oil by mouth first thing in the morning wait 20 minutes and have your breakfast
another way is I eat papaya and kiwi fruit that guarantee to go
dates or prunes also

This boy told me he liked me. About a month later we started dating. This is when I find out that 2 days after he told me he liked me, he hung out with and kissed another girl. He’s apologized but I can’t seem to forgive. What do I do?
easy get rid of him, already a sign of CHEATING, and trust issues at least he did it early in the relationship and not 4 years later

How do you get over a relationship that ended because the family wouldn't accept it? Everything else was perfect otherwise, and they broke up only because they put family first.
EXACTLY what happened to me, he moved on mummy chose a nice girl for him and yes he married her and had a baby,

I disagree because you don't have sex to make up you need to first talk about the problem so the issue can get solved so it doesn't happen again and then have sex and do what you went, me and my ex used sex for everything the problems just escalated no issues were solved so where are we now SEX IS NOT THE ANSWER

I totally agree with you Roxana, couldn't have said it better, its not to be used as a punishment, how can you even enjoy the moment when he has shattered or upset you so much, when we make love we make it for a reason because you love your partner and content with where you are in life, we don't do it when we are tortured or upset and just make love and everything is alright....... that's why there are brothels were we have no feelings or emotions are attached
