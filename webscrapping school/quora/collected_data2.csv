I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!

What has been the most gruesome real footage you've ever seen?
Hi. Let me tell you the story of Tatiane Spitzner and how her recorded death shocked the world and opened many eyes to what exactly domestic violence looks like. Tatiane was a 29-year-old lawyer who lived with her husband Luis Filipe in Guarapuava. Looking at pictures of the couple they looked like a happy and deeply in love couple: But behind these pictures hid a truly shocking reality that ended in a horrific way. On the 22nd of July, 2018, the couple went to a party and when they returned (at around 2:30 AM) they can be seen on CCTV parked in front of their building. They spoke for a little bit and then he suddenly hit her thrice, with considerable strength, in the head. She then tried to run and opened the door, but he forced her to close it and put her seatbelt around her neck, while grabbing her by the hair and punching her head repeatedly. Then they drove to the garage, he parked the car, got out, dragged her out and pushed her against the car. He then punched her throat causing her to pass out and fall to the ground. As she laid there he parked his car and two minutes later he came back and started kicking her until she woke up and got up. When she started regaining consciousness she decided to run for her life and she started running towards the elevator as he chased her. They both managed to get inside the elevator and she clicked the ground floor button instead of the fourth floor where they lived. When the elevator opened on the ground floor she tried to run, and managed to get out but he grabbed her and forced her back inside grabbing her and putting her against the wall until the door closed again. When they got to the fourth floor she put her hands on the sides of the elevator to try and stop him from forcing her to get out, but to no avail. When they left the elevator, it was the last time Tatiane was seen alive. When they got to their apartment, the neighbours heard her cries for help but did nothing. Less than 15 minutes later the camera outside the building filmed her body falling onto the floor. He claimed that she jumped by herself, but it's clear that's a lie because in the video we can see that she was not trying to block her face or even screaming. She was lifeless when she fell. He came downstairs, picked her up and took her to the elevator where he, covered in her blood, started to caress her face and covered her breasts. He took her back to their apartment and then came back and cleaned the blood from the elevator, before driving away. Dunia Rampazzo, a prosecutor on the case, stated: Our investigation proves that the victim was killed inside the apartment by asphyxiation and her body was thrown over the balcony of the apartment. We believe the accused then took the elevator to the ground floor and collected Tatiane’s body, taking it back up to the apartment in the elevator. We suspect that before she was killed, Luis subjected his wife to a prolonged period of violent physical aggression. This was not a suicide, but femicide. The aggressor then attempted to escape by car. The case had multiple delays due to covid, but in May this year, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. If you know someone who has an abusive partner or if you're in such a relationship, get help. Her death cannot be in vain, and it'll hopefully inspire those who need the inspiration to get out while they can. Thank you for reading.

What do you remember about your first relationship?
I wouldn’t call my first boyfriend a relationship. The middle school stuff is just puppy love. My first real relationship was in high school. We lived in the same neighborhood but went to different schools. He played football and was super smart. My parents loved him. Not as much as me of course . We went on dates, walked around the neighborhood, snuck in some hanky panky when our parents weren’t home. We even made love in a hotel room when my parents took us to a fancy NYE party/dance. He left for college a year before me. He stopped calling and writing letters as often and I panicked and broke up with him. That aaa 30 years ago and he has kept up with me all these years. He’s married and has a beautiful family wile I’m still struggling with fear of abandonment that has affected my curren…

Did your ex change after you broke up?
Only after a year and three months of the year was no contact. We both changed. I worked on myself the past year. He worked on himself. We are both more ready to acknowledge on our own issues and we communicate much better. It’s falling in love all over again. He is even more romantic

Have you been intimate with an ex?
Yes. Then we took a break and I worked on myself. Now we are back together. We do not live together like we did previously. It took about 3 months of no contact to get us back together. Try it.

Should I expect an ex-narcissist to come back after he’s had me blocked already for 3 weeks? He’s never done this before.
Why would you want a narcissist back? Focus on yourself and work on becoming the best version of yourself. You have to look within to find out why you want to return to a narcissist. He’s probably with his new “supply” (someone who uplifts his ego) and will pop back up in your life when you’re not giving a care about him l, him, after she’s left.

What are the signs of flirtation that girls miss?
Sometimes girls just don't see the signs especially when they are not used to being flirted with. If a girl is approached by a guy I feel like she should try to relax and maybe see what he's thinking about. If she's given a hint of a date or something else it might help!

As a male I am attracted to only those girls who wear skinny jeans leggings and tights? How normal is this?
I'd say everyone has there own attraction to different types of women. Some men prefer tall, thin, fluffy(little extra lbs), blonde, or brunette women. I guess it boils down to what you want. You are very normal!

Do you feel bad about telling lies regarding your ex?
Depends. I guess I consider an ex exactly that no longer my problem. Spreading rumors about someone you used to care about is immature. I wouldn't recommend it. The best revenge is living your life happily. Doing things that make your life incredible. Being a bit more spontaneous or whatever you enjoy. Don't feed into the feeling you may have of wanting him/her to suffer like you are move on is the best answer.

Should I continue to give her the silent treatment?
Depends on what she did! I personally don't encourage the silent treatment as it gets you nowhere really. If I was in that position I'd try explaining to her how what she did made you feel. Such as when you (blank) it made me feel like (blank) and I'm (happy, sad, pissed off) and I'd like to clear the air between us.

What is the solution to the Palestinian and Israeli conflict?
The Israeli people must adopt the orphans of Palestine, and the Palestinians must adopt the orphans of Israel, and each must raise these children in the religions of the deceased parents. This will bring these peoples together in a just and lasting peace.

My Father never talks to a women with disrespect and i have the same habit. He never spoke a ill word about her with me in his entire life. Whenever i visit my father he asks how is everything at home.My Father even made attempts to forget everything even before my kid was born and tried to invite her for family functions and also gave us to freedom to stay wherever we want, but this time my wife did not wan’t to join family no matter how hard i tried to convince her.
“ who is wrong now”? His father or his wife decide yourself.

How many dads out there don't know how to change their baby's diaper?
You need to get your head in the game, my friend. As your children get older their problems get bigger and more complex. I often wish that I could soothe my troubled 6 year old as easily as I did when she was a baby. Changing diapers is something concrete that you can do to help both your baby and wife. Don’t miss the chance to fix all the problems that have an instant solution!

What are some good crafts to make with toddlers?
Toddlers are easily entertained just not for very long! It's best to have things set up and ready to go but I'm never that organized. Washable paint - Paint with fingers, paint with brushes, cut up some clean sponges (into shapes if you're feeling industrious) and dip the sponges into the paint. Stamps - Stamps and an ink pad are always a hit. Glue- Print their name in glue on a piece of construction paper. Then they can stick marshmallows/cotton/etc to the glue and 'make' their name. Threading: Toddlers can thread cheerios or colorful straws (that you've cut into pieces) onto pipe cleaners. Twist it into a bracelet. Use painter's tape to make a design on craft paper. Let your little one paint all over the paper. While the paint is still wet carefully remove the tape to show the design - grea…

My biggest regret in life so far is having children. How do I learn to enjoy parenting more?
Kids can be boring. Get them involved in things that you like to do. They are incredibly malleable. Just use your powers for good not evil.

No one tells you that sometimes these wonderful bundles of magic suck. Their dispositions can be bad and taking care of them is a lot of work - emotional work, financial work, manual work. Dude, it's a lot. Many long days will be spent trying to wipe up their bodily fluids before those same bodily fluids end up being wiped up on you. That right there can be a whole day. It isn't one long joy fest of parenting. It's a lot (if you're lucky) of little moments that make it profound.

I like your way of studying- this is similar to how I studied in college, too. You mentioned that medication doesn’t always work for you- I’d experienced this too, and after talking with my doctor, found out that most ADHD medication affects women more/less depending on where they’re at in their menstrual cycle. Not sure if this helps/is useful, but thought I’d share!

Is it normal for someone with ADHD to think about multiple topics within a short period of time?
TL;DR: Yes, sometimes. You know that feeling when you’ve read the same paragraph five times, but you still don’t know what it says? That’s what ADHD feels like. It doesn’t necessarily mean that I have racing thoughts in my head all the time, it just means I can’t focus on what I’m wanting to focus on. Sometimes when I’m feeling high energy or excited, I can get racing thoughts like what you’ve described. Sometimes, I feel more like I have a brain fog, and it’s difficult to grasp onto the train of thought that I want without it slipping away. The severity of ADHD is different from person-to-person, and even an individuals lived experience can vary. For example, we know that menstruating women have worse/better symptoms during different times in their cycle. Or, I know I tend to exhibit more “h…

Can Adderall give someone with ADHD a stimulant feeling if they are new to it?
When I was very first figuring out what dosage worked best for me, there were a couple of times that I’d accidentally taken more than needed. Being on too much addy can feel a bit exciting, like a strong caffeine buzz, but it’s not super comfortable, either. I felt like a machine that had been given too strong of a voltage- lots of energy, exciting, but exhausting. On edge, like a taut string.
On both occasions, once the addy wore off my body felt a bit sore, like I’d been dehydrated. I had a difficult time falling asleep, and my appetite was gone. It’s not super fun.

My son has been begging for a new phone. I have tried all the options, but all of them are too expensive. What should I do?
Buy what you can afford. Be open with your child about what you can and cannot afford. If they’re old enough, set up a payment plan with them.
Ie: “I can afford to front X amount; let’s see if we can find a phone in that budget. If you don’t like any of these and want something more expensive, I’m happy to pay that amount towards what you’d like. If you can come up with the rest, we can purchase this phone you’ve been wanting.”

If your adult son/daughter, who is very much capable of working and help witht he house finances, doesn't want to work out of pure laziness and expects to get everything form others, would you let them stay at your house or would you kick them out?
TL;DR: Kick them out. Communicate and set clear boundaries. Help a family member out if you can, but know the difference between helping and enabling. ___________________________________________________________ I had this situation recently with a younger brother. I was torn. He didn’t have a job when he came to live with me, and no savings either. No problem, I’d said, first month’s on me.

Does Adderall make you more motivated and confident (ADHD)?
Adderall doesn’t make me more motivated or confident. It makes my brain quiet, and more functional for modern purposes. I’m definitely motivated to get my job done- I like my boss and co-workers, and completing my job makes work easier for them. I like the sense of accomplishment I get upon completing projects. I particularly enjoy having money to spend on things like food and housing. But sometimes my brain has other plans. My lack of attention isn’t a lack of motivation. It’s a lack of “flow”, or consistency. Starting a task isn’t a problem, but staying on task continues to evade me. Before my diagnosis, I relied on extensive checklists and reminders, and the occasional nudge from a co-worker. Adderall alleviates the need for those extra systems. Adderall doesn’t add motivation- it just mak…

How do I deal with an ADHD child?
It’s encouraging to see this question asked. As a heads up, I do not have a professional background in treating ADHD, so what I have to say is all anecdotal. Both my twin brother and I were diagnosed with ADHD. He was diagnosed around 14, I was 24. Here’s what would have helped: Pro-active Monitoring: In my brother’s case, he was never taken in for diagnosis until he was really struggling in school. He got help after everything had gone wrong. I wasn’t diagnosed, because I managed to squeak by. It took until I was to my breaking point before I got diagnosed, and got help; it’s made a world of difference, and I always wish that I’d had help sooner. If you are a parent and you think there’s a chance your child may have ADHD (it’s highly heritable), keep an eye out for the signs, and get help be…

I learned about this early 2021 around my 30th birthday. I have been under the thumb of the same Narcissistic foster parent (mother) for 25 years, and NEVER have I been allowed to speak the truth or my mind or have a back bone. I remember being backed into a corner by her and her friends being severely abused and hit and beat on as a child. And unfortunately, I've carried that trait into my adulthood, until I woke up at 3 in the morning in pain and went to the ER and found out I almost had a heart attack or stroke either that day or week, and then found out later on that week I developed BOTH Hashimoto's Disease AND Graves Disease (thyroid diseases) and that it's REALLY RARE to have both diseases, and then realized after doing research that it all has to do with using my voice, and that my foster parent was trying to take away my voice and literally kill me. I'm still sick, still have to take medication right now, but little by little I've been using my voice and finding the strength I used to have again. In fact, when the Narcissist foster parent came to see me for my 31st birthday and started stuff, I was able to call her out (which infuriated her) but left me feeling more powerful speaking truth to her lies. But yes, dealing with a Narcissist CAN and WILL put you in the hospital if you don't do something about it.

Honestly, I left her sorry behind in Orlando and dropped her. Went No contact PERMANENTLY.
For YEARS I had put up with her neeed to be the center of my universe, dealt with her insulting comments, didn't wear the same colors as her or same perfumes or eat the same foods as her (etc), dealt with her making comments about me behind my back and our ""friends"" that we shared disrespecting me because of her, her therapist snapping at me for her behavior because she made up stories and blamed me for things, said she ""might"" have done stuff but it was only because of _______ (name your excuse), the list go ones and on…
Until one day, I had enough.
I remember we had a friend who worked at Disney World and we were in Orlando, and she had helped me move to Tampa, and in conversation with her and that acquaintance, I told them MY SPIRITUAL BELIEFS had changed and that I no longer held the same beliefs as then, and they froze, and THAT is when EVERYTHING changed. I saw her become possibly the worst version of her that I had seen. She became angry, asked why I couldn't have told her earlier, then started to argue with me saying trying to tell me about how ""amazing"" and ""great"" our denomination was (at the time) and that the LEAST I could have done was _______(x,y and z). And then she and that acquaintance got up, went into the acquaintance's room and slammed the door, leaving me out in the living room. I sat on the couch and thought all night. Before I realized it, it was morning and the sun was rising. I remember going over how she treated me through the years, whether it was a things done or said and I remembered them both getting up and coming out from their room and her angrily stomping around, wouldn't look at me and put shoes on and went downstairs and the acquaintance making faces at me and closing the door and then 15 minutes later she came back, slammed a venti Starbucks cup full of tea on the table and went back into the acquaintance's room with the acquaintance. Well, I wasn't putting up with it anymore and got my shoes on, took my stuff, put it in the car, took that tea and left QUICKLY and drove my stunned and shocked behind back to Tampa. I was surprised at myself, because I never IMAGINED IN MY LIFE doing what I did or being strong enough to walk away from her, but there I was, in the morning traffic, LEAVING her for GOOD and I wasn't coming back. In the days and weeks and months that followed, she tried to contact me via email and phone calls (to which I bluntly and coldly told her I wouldn't speak to her again, I wasn't explaining anything, and moving forward we will only speak by email), her friends tried multiple times to call me (to which I ended up telling them it's in their beat interest that they mind their own business and stay out of hers and mine), and lived my life. The ex friend tried to contact me multiple times, but I held my ground. It's not say I Don't plan on giving her back why is hers, but it is to say I found my strength and I realize my worth, and I realized I don't need someone who claims to be your friend but it's not a friend. Who makes everything all about her and who needs to be a center of everyone's universe, and whose opinion needs to be the only thing that matters, Who pretends to be a leader and has followers who follow her blindly and treat people any sort of toxic way blindly. Since then, I've learned that toxic people attract toxic people and they come in groups. And I've learned who to let in my life and who did not learn in my life. And I've let go of many friends, and family members, and I have found the strength and self-esteem to be able to make better friends and make better decisions in my life. So I went cold turkey that's what I did with her. I cut her off permanently. For good. I don't know if my story could have helped you, and I don't recommend that everybody do what I did by cutting people off, that's just what I do if that works for me and that's within my personality to do so, and to treat someone coldly and bluntly and to remove them from my life. But I do recommend that you do what's best for you, to remove anyone in your life who is toxic and negative, including friends. And I definitely encourage you to find a method that helps you because you don't deserve having friends in your life who are not loving or supportive or who don't care about you. I hope this helps ❤️.

Why am I wrong to fear that people think that I’m incapable?
You're not wrong for fearing that thought, it's normal to feel that way. But if you're letting it stop you from doing what you can, from living life, then yes, you are very wrong for that. What others think of you and does not matter if they are not there supporting you or encouraging you. Essentially, what others think doesn't matter. Do you think you're capable? If you do, go for whatever it is you want to accomplish . If you don't, only you can sit down and really and truly think over that and figure out what is holding you back and why the opinions of others is tied so strongly into it and affects you so strongly. I will also add this: Not believing in you and your capabilities holds you back from so much in life and all that you can accomplish for you. Never allow the thoughts and nega…

Why is it so hard for people with Major Depressive Disorder to keep our rooms clean?
I will answer this from my own experience : As someone suffering from dysthymia, I have become slow in many things. Cleaning is one of them. A clean house does actually make my head clearer so I should really do it more often. Still, it's rock hard. Why? Let me explain. I am living a pretty isolated life. My husband is off to work everyday and works overtime hours many days. I am pretty much home alone every day. I do have friends but they just live a little far away for me to see them often. I don't mind being alone as I'm introverted and like my own space and silence. Cleaning often just doesn’t bother me. Like many things in life don't bother me. I am thinking alot about why I am alive. Don't get me wrong- I am not suicidal- I just wonder a lot about my purpose on this planet. I am very luc…

How do Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day compare?
So they are up there in my list of bands I love.
Sum 41- Is questioning the world. (The hell song) But has this self deserved anger (still waiting) or sadness (without you) to help provide meaning or searching in life.
Blink 182- Ok let’s make light of real life issues. I don’t need to grow up (Whats my age again) I just wanna do me (shut up) blame my family for who I am (reckless abandon) (anthem part 2) I can’t change nothing (dammit) I’m fuckin sad (Adams song)
Green Day- all I need is me and I love it (Boulevard of broken dreams) (still breathing) (give me novacaine) (brain stew) (basket case)

How do you forgive your haters?
You don’t, u use em as motivators and soon ull evolve godsize (like Pantera’s song). Shove it in their face how awesome u r and how much they aren’t shit compared to u. U secretly act dumb, then u push them to react, and then u realize, u always had the hold over them not them over u. And in the end, u gain this power. And u wonder where it’s been ur whole life.

Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
Nurture. Environment is active and conscious, nature is hidden. Or so for me that’s how I feel. Imagine being born with the most desirable genes and traits, but you go through hardships your whole entire life , the traits that are most valuable to you, of course will stick, but the hardships will cause great havoc in traits that are vulnerable.

Another right here 🤚🏻 trust us all when we say nobody gives a flying fuck. Also trust me when I say, those who don’t give a fuck, will at some point begin to when they repeatedly get accused of something and have it shoved down their throats. So please don’t act surprised when white people do become actually begin to show hate and make attempts to “discredit” whatever bullshit you’re spewing, because you’re literally asking for it sparking these debates. All. The. Time.

Do I still deserve to be happy after all the mistakes I had in the past?
How awful could it be? Hurting someone in purpose is such a bad idea. For whatever reason it is, what's past is past. If only a time machine exists so that you can travel backward and ensure everything was right in the first place. Everyone seems to travel in time to re-do everything all over again. That's the idea of a perfect world. Get rid of the things that could probably drag you from overthinking. Try to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. No doubt, it haunts you like forever? Be thankful for what you have. The power of being thankful even when things don't go your way. Look after something or someone that can make you happy. After all, you just have to move on and be ensure to keep your head up.

Why does make up make me happy?
Drop dead gorgeous wannabe. Who doesn't? Anyhow not too much intentionally. The no make-up makeup look is quite highly desirable. It really takes a good practice to actually master the techniques. I adore people who can do good in makeup and how they can pull it off effortlessly. I dream of someday being a professional makeup artist :)

How can I keep myself together and stay up after not sleeping?
It's somehow very frustrating because all you want to do is going to bed. Your mind, body is tired but you can't sleep. Do you think you are in a state of depression? Perhaps. Probably because it leads to imbalances in chemicals in the brain. At first by trying to avoid using your mobile phone before going to bed yet at the same time you wants to do some reading. It will start to drag you by minutes to hours. While your alarm clock is set at 5.30am. Now it almost 3 in the morning. It can be so stressful until you actually woke up by the alarm feeling restless. Kick-start your day with a cup of coffee will do. Boosting up a bit even though your mind is unable to rest and relax.

Why do people hurt you if you have a good heart and soul?
Remind yourself that kindness is always the answer. We are treated somehow a good wellbeing to not hurt others. To always put ourselves in peoples’ shoe. What if? What if it happens to us, what would it be like to overcome the circumstances? We go beyond the consequences beforehand. By showing some respect I am pretty sure we will less likely to hurt people. Not everyone have the same thinking as we do and by the way of that, we tend to not involve with this circle of population any longer.

I am in tears. I can only imagine how horrific it must have been to actually witness something like that. Your descriptive telling of events brought pictures to my mind that both hurt my heart and astounded me. The suffering that poor man went through—it just wrecks me to think about it. Thank you for showing him care and compassion during his last days. I’m not very religious, but I pray he is now completely in peace.

Can drinking water cause your urine to turn dark brown?
Hello, as far as I know, no. There are several factors that influence the color of your urine so it's best to consult a doctor to figure out if the cause of your unusual urine color is pathological. :)

What is the function of alkaline phosphatase, and why is it used in hematology tests?
Hello I'm just a student studying medical technology so I am not an expert but from the review material I am studying it mentioned that it is a nonspecific enzyme that is found in many tissues but it's major tissue sources are the liver, the bone, the placenta, and the intestine. From what I understand the value of measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lies not in measuring the total ALP levels but in measuring it's isoenzymes. The isoenzymes of ALP is associated with several conditions. The liver isoenzyme is usually elevated in obstructive jaundice, the bone isoenzyme is elevated during osteoblastic activities that's why it is normally elevated in children during periods of growth and, pathologically, in patient's with osteitis deformans. The placental ALP elevates in pregnant women. The…

I'm a targeted individual that is going through the suffering of everyday gangstalking I too also am aware of who is stalking me. My question is what can I do, or who do I call to get justice for me, and my children who are the innocent victims of this sick way of abusing, bullying, and harassment. And in my case I have been sexually abused over and over again by this particular obsessed group. I am going to give you some names of who I know to be involved. The first person that is immediately involved as a perpetrator is Terrance “ tuggs” Winfrey age 35 location in Spokane, WA and his family located off of Greene and 4th Ave in Spokane Washington. And his family that is also located in Sacramento, CA as the Grovan family their headquarters are at Pat Grovan's house in her basement. The entire family which happens to be over 30+ members have all taken part in the stalking, harassment, and sexual assault of myself and claimed to have done this to members of my family. They are upset because I don't want to be with one of their family members which happens to be Terrance”tuggs” Winfrey. If there's any added information that you have for me please let me know right away.

Very interesting ways of looking at jealousy and how to not always be so closed minded and negative about the situation because it should be taken as a way to work on yourself in a positive light don't short change yourself and feed that negative approach to jealousy, When embracing the fact that you have this time in your life to reflect on who you are and what you want, minus all the yucky entanglements of emotions, and hatred you have for someone else. Your free from the burden of them having the reins on your emotions. Isn't that something.

Isn't being yourself the reason why you got in this mess in the first place? I know I am not fake or phony and don't have to put on an act for nobody. My emotions are real and I don't sugar coat nothing. But this must be enough to keep some people obsessed with my personality. It almost makes me want to do the opposite of being myself, because maybe it would help all of us out by them being able to learn different things to do instead of obsess over me and would also help me find peace

Very true. I look at men's shoes when I find the man physically attractive. If they have horrible off brand shoes and he's cute I find him less attractive after that. Sometimes I can view that differently as well by having nice shoes or a good unique style it can make the man attractive even if he's not so attractive style is everything.

Why was my thirteen-year-old upset when I told her that she was too old for a birthday party?
Because your a birch for that. Why would you tell your 13 year old she's too old for a birthday party? And then ask why she got upset? Not okay. You probably broke her heart. Wouldn't you want your child to still be a child and be able to do those things for her at any age. What is wrong with you?

I totally agree with you about the rate of speed ppl drive & they love to ride your bumper to get you to move, even police officers do it. It’s very annoying when ppl are walking in the streets holding signs up asking for money. I know which convenient stores to avoid due to this problem. The things that go on here is not just a Baton Rouge problem, this is happening every where. There’s a lot of racism & rude people, but we also have some friendly ppl I've ever met.

I was born & raised in Baton Rouge. I have my moments where I hate living here & times I love it. There’s a lot racism’s here, & some of the schools are awful. L.S.U is a great university, but to me it's a place to party. They have a great football team, but I can care less because I'm not a fan of anything dealing with sports. We also an H.B.U.C ( SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY) with one of the best nursing programs ( my opinion) yaay jags. It's not a lot of stuff to do these days. I don't travel much because I'm a full-time college student, & simply don't have the time. New Orleans is a 60/90 minute drive & one of my favorite places to spend a weekend. There's definitely always something going on in N.O almost every weekend & I love the nightlife there 😊. But honestly if I had it my way I would’ve moved some place else where it snows but my husband not having

That’s not how Jesus would speak about anyone and you have no right to judge her because you are a sinner too (John 8:7) and you’re no better (Romans 14:1–23). Jesus taught us to love everyone and to be peaceful (1 John 4:16–19), even to those that are not Christian. Please practice what you preach.

My theory is it's a very high sensitivity of clairvoyance, but without support in learning how to control it on a spiritual level and grounding it, it can be destructive.

Do you think most mental health issues are psychic abilities that are uncontrolled? Such as people with OCD and intrusive thoughts are probably picking up on thoughts/energy from spirits or from people around them.

They are tricksters and if they cannot directly attack you, they may find their way through people you care about to try and weaken your spirit. Its so important to pray, meditate, focus on being love, being positive, and have faith because this strengthens your aura and this can shift others around you to a higher frequency as well. Also, when you are aware of their tricks, you hold more power over them.

Yes, in hindsight I realized that I should have told my parents what was going on and I was very, very naive. However, being only 12 years old at the time I sadly didn’t know what abuse really was (especially emotional and sexual abuse) so I didn’t know at the time that anything was wrong. Also, he had me so manipulated that I was scared to tell anyone that what was happening didn’t feel right because I didn’t want him to get in trouble. He had me convinced that he “loved” me and that he was there for me over anyone else.
Years later when I told my mom some of what happened, she told me that at the time it was almost like I was in a trance or was brainwashed because no matter how many times she told me to stop talking to him, I just wouldn’t listen to reason. That’s actually common in abuse victims.
If I could go back and change things, believe me, I would in a heartbeat.
I wish that 12 year old me had been more educated about what behaviors from boys (especially older ones) are okay and what aren’t. Luckily, more schools have programs that discuss sexual abuse now so more children are being taught what is okay and what isn’t when it comes to touches and behaviors from other people.
Thanks for your response.

As a young adult (20) who was a disrespectful and sassy 12 year old daughter myself, I would try to calmly sit down and talk to her and let her know that you’re there for her. I’d ask her what’s going on and explain to her that you don’t appreciate how she’s been acting and that you took her phone as a result of her behavior. All behaviors have consequences and punishing her for being disrespectful and rude is fine. But my guess is that something is causing her to act the way she is. I can tell you that I and many friends I know greatly valued privacy at that age, and she may have lashed out because she felt her privacy was violated when you took her phone. Maybe ask her if that’s why she got so upset when you took it as a punishment. I always had an attitude at that age because I was feeling so much and going through so much. I had undiagnosed anxiety until I was 16 which came with depressive episodes and I was self harming and felt suicidal regularly. I was also being bullied and sexually/emotionally abused. All of these were things my parents didn’t know about so they didn’t understand why I was in emotional turmoil and being so defensive and rude to them. I didn’t feel like I could talk to them about it and when they would get frustrated with me and get angry at me for being so upset all the time it made me feel like they would never understand and that I was all alone. I’d shut myself away in my room and just wanted to be alone and seemingly never wanted to interact with them. And when they made me interact with them, I was negative and kept to myself the whole time. When they’d ask what was wrong and why I was being so rude I would immediately get defensive and get an attitude because I felt attacked. Does that sound familiar? If so, and if she won’t talk to you about whatever may be going on, I would recommend looking into a therapist or mental health professional. Even if it’s not something like anxiety or depression, your daughter may be having a tough time dealing with emotions and feelings that come with being 12 and puberty. I know that for myself, my hormones were all over the place and I just didn’t know how to cope with that. Therapists can be for everyone and don’t have to be a forever thing. Everyone can use some help coping with the stress of life sometimes and believe it or not, being a 12 year old girl can be very stressful. Now, I’d also like to mention that as a parent you do have the right to go through your daughter’s phone and see if anything is going on. And doing that may end up being necessary. However, if you choose to do that please seek professional advice on how to go about that in a healthy way because it can be really traumatizing to the child. When my parents wanted to search my phone when I was younger it was incredibly stressful for me because even though I knew that they owned the phone and had a right to, that was one of the only things I had as a teen where I had a certain amount of privacy expected and them demanding to search it felt violating. I think it’s really easy for parents to forget that it’s important that their kids need a certain amount of privacy too as another human being. I hope any of this helps and I hope that things work out soon with your daughter. Best of luck to you.

What?? I never said to subscribe to me what are you talking about lol. This is the very first time in like the three years I’ve been a member of quora that I posted something and regretfully so! I never post or answer anything I’m just someone interested in reading things from knowledgeable people. Unfortunately, not everyone on here who answers questions are knowledgeable of the subject…. ahem…. anyways, I don’t owe you a name or a profile picture and it doesn’t make me any less human just because I don’t show those things. And no need to project your lack of substance onto me, which appears so obviously in your “writing”.

Lol. And I’ve seen many people like you who structure their sentences and say certain words against borderlines like you do. The point is I was just trying to help you see something I felt you weren’t noticing and that maybe you were answering some questions incorrectly because of your negative experience. But yes I realize now my words have fallen on deaf ears and you are determined that everything you say is correct and that anything I say is discredited because I have bpd. But you’re entitled to your opinions, I just thought I could get some kind of proper response from you but you responded in the way I was afraid you would. So I understand now there was no point in trying to talk with you to try to help you understand that all the things you write about borderlines aren’t correct. I am not implying that everything you say is wrong, what I am saying though is that some of the things you say are wrong. It doesn’t matter if you’re an asshole about it or sugar coat it, I don’t care about that, that wasn’t my point… what I care about is that some of the things you’ve written are incorrect therefore spreading misinformation. And if multiple people have told you this before perhaps it’s not us that’s wrong, it’s you lol.

Look, Jason, i initially read your response to this question then ventured over to your profile and saw numerous answers you gave regarding bpd questions. It feels like you have a biased view on borderlines because of your negative experience with a bpd person. I completely understand why you’re so angry and why you feel like bpd individuals are “shitty”. However, it’s important to remember that just like there are “normal” people who are shitheads and who are not, the same goes for borderlines. I understand there are people diagnosed with this disorder that do have bad intentions and who don’t care about the suffering they inflict on to others, perhaps for those kinds of people it is too late for them, I have met those types of people before. This can be said about anyone suffering from anything, not just bpd. Some people, in general, aren’t good people at heart. That being said, and I cannot stress this enough, NOT ALL BORDERLINES ARE BAD PEOPLE. There are borderlines out there that have tried so hard to get better. Some have and some are still on that path. They do not get enjoyment from being the way they are. They don’t get enjoyment from being mentally ill and from seeing their loved ones suffer because of their unintentional wrong-doings. It may sound silly coming from me but, it’s not so black and white. I don’t want to be this way. I do whatever I can to get better. Getting better has become a life long journey. And in order for this bad stigma to go away that’s associated with those who have borderline, it is crucial that people like you don’t spread hate. Whether you see it or not, I am telling you your post sounded hateful. And you have every right to be hateful towards a person who hurt you or affected you so negatively. But to group everyone together and assume that all borderlines fit into one giant shitty person category is wrong to do. You may be stuck with the thoughts you have towards bpd people because of your experience with them, and nothing I, or anyone says will change your mind. That’s fine. I understand what its like to be so sure of something. But because you’ve never experienced it yourself, as in you actually having it, it may be near impossible for you to truly know the magnitude of how this disorder feels. I may have trouble with my thoughts and emotions but I’m still a decent person with morals and values and try to be as non judge mental as possible. My personal relationships are chaotic and I have many deep issues I need to understand still to hopefully get past this. Maybe I never will. But please, if you want to answer questions about bpd, please don’t spread misinformation. Please read non-biased information about bpd. And if you can’t be un-biased, please don’t spread hate and lies. Not every bpd is the person who hurt you.

Drive to a gas station and ask some people for help I see people all the time asking for money for gas and when I do have it I give . You might meet some nice people and mean and it may be hard to ask but it might work it’s just a idea

What are the temperature control features of Instacart's delivery vehicles? How do they compare to those of Amazon Flex and Postmates?
Instacart does not have a fleet of delivery vehicles. They do not send out “temperature controlled” company cars or trucks at all. When you order through Instacart, the order gets sent out to independent contractors (aka: Moms, Dads, students, neighbors, anyone who needs extra income can sign up to SHOP & deliver for Instacart). When that order gets picked up, that person will drive their own vehicle to the store, park, go inside & shop for the items on your list, go to checkout, wait in line, bag your groceries, load them back into their personal vehicle, drive to your home, unload all bags & carefully leave them at your doorstep. Would you like to know the average pay for someone who is doing all that work AND driving their OWN vehicle? I can tell u that it’s barely enough to cover the gas…

Yes, in fact, the Instacart app will send you a push notification after the order has been placed (but before its been picked up by a shopper) that asks you if there is anything else youd like to add. The app will also show you items to buy based on your previous order history. If your order is already being shoppe...

Would I be the worst person ever if I returned 2 of my 4 dogs to the shelter? I am a single parent and struggling to cope.
Yes. Dogs are family. Find a way to cope.

Can’t we do better….for Dixie and all the others?
Author Unknown “I was leaving the dollar store today and the cute little lady in front of me , alll dressed up, was struggling. She didn’t know her PIN number at the register. The man behind me kept sighing and said “Come ON” while the cashier and I tried to help her. When she was trying to leave, she asked for help trying to get the cart out the door because it had a big pole on it to prevent people from taking the carts out. I explained that they weren’t allowed outside and that I could help her. She immediately declined but looked out at the parking lot and then back at all her bags. “Really,” I said, “I would love to help.” She said, “Oh I couldn’t do that. You might not even be parked near me!” Seriously? When walking out with her, I learned her name was Dixie and she was 83 and stopped in after church and the grocery store. “These errands wear my old body out!” She sighed as we loaded the bags into car. The part that made me so sad was when I finished and shut the trunk, she asked me how much she owed me. I laughed and answered but she said, “No, I must pay you!”. Obviously, I declined and told her to have a beautiful day BUT how tragic is it that she thought she should pay me to walk with her to her car. Sparklers, we must do better. We must be proactive, bolder and deliberate with our kindness. We are failing our elderly. We are failing our young ones who will only know a world such as this. We are failing each other. Step up and go outside of your comfort zone today and just spark. Seriously! Oh…and invite your friends worldwide to our group so we can set this world on fire with GOODNESS.” Author: Unknowns Source: Let’s Spread the Kindness

60 Minutes had a hit piece on Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, but failed to disclose these facts: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the US Naval Reserve Center in Dallas Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant junior grade, to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a Lieutenant Commander in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal. He represented Florida's 6th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018. Obviously, with these qualifications, he is NOT qualified to be a Democrat, or serve in a senior political position in our nation’s capital when one considers and compares the credentials of Pelosi, Schumer, Harris or Biden. He has kept Florida free of the grip of a tyrannical federal government while our State of Florida still prospers, which is why more people have moved to Florida than any other state for the last couple years. So, for anyone who criticizes him, I have a request of you. Can you please post your education and service to our country in a resume so we can compare and put your opinion in perspective? THIS, my fellow Americans is the greatest Governor in our nation! I hope 2028 we find him in the White House...right after VP to Trump in 2024

I don’t know if it’s comfort, it’s what I’ve seen while working in the field of behavioral health. I’m sorry that presenting it in a matter-of-fact way is disturbing to you. There was typically an incident that led to them being there, either a threat to harm someone else or themselves. Being placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold is a process that requires more than just conjecture; evidence is needed for that hold.

Hi Manny, I appreciate you explaining a lot of these intricacies. (This is not sarcasm, I know it’s hard to tell over the internet). But you did a really good job of making this easy for someone who is not super well-versed on these issues to understand. I appreciate that.

My mom’s favorite to use on me: “if you would just try harder…..”
If I would just try harder what? Will my brain chemistry change? My genetics? (Granted I do realize a certain level of “trying” is needed in order to develop coping skills and emotional regulation skills).
The assumption that I am NOT trying is insulting. This is me trying.

…thank you to the person who already said “ok boomer”, but may I reiterate: “OK BOOMER”.
Sir, I have no idea if you are a baby boomer or not, but your comment sounds very inline with something a baby boomer would say about the Millennial Generation.
Were all of the Millennials who VOLUNTARILY signed up for the military immediately following 9/11 doing so because they knew “no hardship, pain, or suffering”?
OR were all the Baby Boomers who had to get DRAFTED demonstrating their lack of desire to go through “hardship, pain, and/or suffering”.
Have some respect for your Millennials.

100 truth. The Gambino's primarily own Long Island and also have a significant presence in Rochester, Miami, some neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn along with sprouting up in Los Angeles and other parts of California. The Genovese have control over pretty much all upstate New York outside of Rochester and The Arms Turf. The Genovese are also VERY VERY dominant around Portland in Oregon which is why the Russian mob (who own that territory) are at war with them now. The Latinos are also at a turf war with parts of The Outfit and more specifically the Genovese/Lucianos in Chicago. Many of the things that the Feds say on the news is false! The Mafia is still around and have a much different kind of influence then they used to. They infiltrated parts of law enforcement on Long Island in order to have a heads up on arrests for their guys and associates. They infiltrated parts of the FBI Office in Upstate New York for the same reason. The Genovese have a significant amount of family members in the Southwest part of the country who are either in the military or are ex-military. Many of the things they used to do mutated into things like mortgage fraud, identity theft, credit card skimming, COVID-19 assistance program fraud, tax fraud and other white collar crimes because they carry much less jail time.
The Mafia is evil.

United Blood Nation.
The West Side signed itself out of the UBN. And that's, not the East Side’s problem.
The founder of the Bloods which was founded in LA, was incarcerated in Rikers with a high ranking member of the Lucchese Family. When the Families didn't want him, they exiled him to LA. From that animosity he had towards The Families he found an excuse to find another Gang “to protect the Blood Families from the Crips”. The same founding statement of La Cosa Nostra and La Camorra from 800 years prior.

Involved? You're Funny! The Gambino Family uses the Bloods Gang to do all of its hits even to this day! They would never throw one of their own under the bus unless they were a snitch! The Lucchese Family and it’s founder were in prison with the Founder of the Bloods in Rikers so they share a very special bond. The Crips are closer with the Lucianos and Genovese on the West Coast and in Chicago. Whereas, Luccheses and Gambinos are very close with the Bloods in New York and on the East Coast. In General, the Italian Mafia has allowed people in the Bloods and Crips to marry into their Families under certain circumstances like when their is strategic value. So to answer your question, their are affiliated but not always on a personal level and more on a business level.

Why are people more united by what they hate than by what they love?
It's the same reason why everyone around the world wanted to help NYC on 9/11. And on every other day people in NYC are considered rude, self centered and selfish.

I don't want to be gay. Is there any way to stop it?
It's a blessing to be gay. Gays dress better, have better jobs, make more money, are generally better people, happier, when they get married they appreciate it more, better style and cook better - just to name a few. Be who you are.

I'm 90 days sober from a five year meth addiction. I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and struggle to do things. When will it get easier and what can I do to feel better?
It took about a year for me to start to feel better (I slept a lot). It has been an uphill battle, but worth it ultimately, as I could not live any longer as I was.
After 2 1/2 years, I feel tremendously better!

How does your anger affect your relationships?
Man. My anger at my junky tweeker ex is so bad that the woman I use to love is now who I send the most vile hurtful messages to and it’s tsking me down a dark hole. My energy is down and it’s pouring into the rest of my life. Anger is good when you take the lesson on why you are feeling it. It’s causing me to want to destroy her but I’m hurting myself in the process.

What is your review of Bremerton, WA?
Bremerton is a navy town. Ship port to be exact. It’s old. Run down for the most part. Lack of good jobs and rampant meth use that had already wreaked havoc in the early 90s. When we were young all we did was get into trouble. Bremerton is really a dump.

What are baby steps you can start taking to start loving yourself and what you look like?
If there are things you don’t like about yourself that you CAN change then tackle one thing at a time. Take something little that is easier and fix it. Celebrate your victory and then tackle something else that you will make you feel better about yourself. Baby steps. Accept the things you can not change and be the best most confident you that you can be!

What are some good coping mechanisms to stop someone from relapsing?
You can’t stop anyone from relapsing. For one, you cant make anyone do anything. For two relapsing is part of the process so they say, not sure what they might relapse on, but a few things are nasty, life and soul consuming and its an ongoing battle for life I have heard.
You can encourage and support them, let them know you care and help them see there is a different option.

This person appears to be asserting that a large big toe relative to the other toes may be an indication of ""nervous weakness"" that the person is attempting to conceal, maybe by being inconspicuous or avoiding drawing attention to themselves. Just to be clear, here is no scientific evidence to support the notion that the size or form of a person's toes is related to their personality or behavior in any manner.

Quite difficult to apply to those who are Ignorant and/or Irrational but it is the right thing to do! I do and have believed this is the way to deal with all the hate and deceitfulness in the world today towards others.

What is the meaning of Romans 12:19-21?
It is surprising how difficult this passage is for Christians to understand, although it is straightforward when you read it with an open mind. Paul is saying not to seek revenge against your enemies. Paul makes a vague allusion to Deuteronomy 32:35, saying that any revenge should be left to God. He then says that if we go out of our way to be good to those we consider enemies, helping them in any way possible, we will cause them to suffer burning shame (“coals of fire”) with greater effect than any revenge is likely to achieve. He summarises: Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil with good.

My Son joined right out of high school, went 0311, it was tough but he really felt like he was where he was suppose to be, it was home for him. He then was selected for MSG, passed the course and did some Embassy time, then was selected to a FAST Team which he seems to like too, but his sense of loyalty is… and always will be with the Infantry no doubt. One builds a bond, a sense of loyalty and a deep appreciation/understanding for what sacrifice and commitment means for the betterment of the guy next to you, the Corp’s and service to (and for) our nation.That life lesson can be well worth the investment of what one would put into it and conversely what one would get out of there experiences’.
However, there is something to be said about acquiring skills through other POG MOS’s, the VA working as it should and the fact you are left to pickup the pieces once your out. Though my son has had… and friends of his have had offers with major corporations offering them employment as soon as they get out for 6 figure security contracts both privet sector as well as Government both in country and out. So I see it as… make the best out of whatever you decided to do. Your training will help you move forward in life if you embrace the training use it as your weapon to go out there and make your way in this world.
And as a (Combat-Veteran myself} who served in the ARMY and have had more experience with the VA and society in general than most on the subject. I agree with the OP on his assessment of what really happens to the Vet’s here at home after all the hard work, sacrifice and hardships left for you and your loved ones to deal with can be extremely challenging. It’s a fight all the way through life, why not get to see some of the world on there dime and pick up what you can to get a running start when exit the service. As one E-8 MARINE said to me the other day, “It beats working at Wall-Mart”. Give it a shot if you apply yourself there is no telling where you might end up because there’s always opportunity if you look for it.

AGREED: Solid Perspective on Reality! Contrary to a lot of people’s belief’s, As a Veteran who has experienced/participated in a coup/take-over Military Coup/Take-Over of Government and repatriation of it’s population, it’s population. It’s my contention that it is… very possible that if the extreme shift of the Ult-Left continues to push this narrative of extremism ideology, extremism/ideology and propaganda, “our way or we all burn” type mentality, we will see those who are now understanding (maybe for the first time) it’s now or never to rise and save what’s left of this Republic and that for which it stands… they (we) very well could loose everything if they we don’t fight back with equal or greater force “you force. I believe we will end up in a civil war for a number of reasons, and I know from experience, “Sometimes it takes a wolf to kill a wolf”. The sheep dogs aren’t getting it done against this uprising of the kind of violence we are experiencing from the extreme left today. The kinds of mass rioting and civil disobedience directed at our current President, who is the legitimate Elected Government Official, is (in my eye’s) Treason and puts all of us at risk if it’s not stopped and stopped quickly. Whatever it takes to get these unruly masses under control must and ultimately will be a wolf to kill a wolf”, just being a sheep dog won’t get it done.done or we will all suffer the consequences.

I’d rather be in a foxhole with someone that wanted to join, than someone who was guilted by a total stranger on the internet, and called a coward. I think it takes quite a bit of courage to profess you made a mistake and don’t want to serve.
Signed a combat infantryman.

That’s a fair and reasonable question brother, and I’m glad you’re at least willing to consider another candidate, if available. I’m a lifelong registered republican, gun owner, combat infantryman , a Texan, and hell I have a shaved head, a beard, and beer belly! I am the stereotypical dream demographic of a Trump follower by all visual, and assumed standards. I shamefully admit I voted for Trump in 2016 for the mere fact that he represented the least of two evils (Hillary). I just as shamefully did not vote for either candidate in 2020, and will be voting 3rd party or write in “deez nutz” in November’24.
Trump ain’t no republican brother, he has masterfully found inroads to a usually silent majority(?) and manipulated that disenfranchised group of Americans to a fever pitch, he’s a genius by no means, but rather a shrewd manipulator of basic human nature of a certain demographic.
Biden is not a viable option either, trumps meteoric rise to prominence was a set of dumb luck, perfect opportunities represented by 2 of the worst polarizing democratic candidates that folks hate so much they will vote for anything that is the polar opposite of these two democrats.
I’m 55 and have never witnessed a hatred filled, vitriol controlled constituency anything near what Trump has created.
Ive never feared a constituency until trumps creation, I can take care of myself, but trump owns the golden dog-whistle. I’m sure a large majority of my associates, combat brothers, and general public will continue in goose step admiration for him.
I’m not hearing anyone of his followers saying things like “Trump is a mess but Biden isn’t a better choice,” people are “convinced” that Trump is the best candidate ever?!
Human nature, unfortunately, is very easy to manipulate in large groups, Trump has rewritten the book in this arena…I don’t even wish ill will on Trump…I’m also looking for an alternative to the two jokes that the “powers that be” have decided are the best choices.

Thank you for being a bright light in an otherwise pit of darkness. You could have easily looked the other way, ignored, or even added to their mental anguish. You chose to show compassion to souls who have no hope or even understand why or where they’re at. I wish blessings on you and hope you realize the blessings you brought to your fellow inmates, you did this for no other reward than that of knowing you were helping unfortunate souls, while you yourself was suffering the same hell. I am certain your acts will be rewarded in this life or when you pass into eternity. Bless you.

What are LGBT+ people tired of hearing?
“So, when did you choose to be gay?” My response is always “When did you choose to be straight?” the look on their faces is priceless! Haha. Also, when men preach that they're against homosexuals and then say “It's only okay if it's just girl on girl.” Then proceed to ask if they can watch or join.” HA. Men that act like that should have no right to vote against gay marriage. When men talk about how disgusting gay men are in terms of how they male love..Like, really bitch! Who cares bc love is love and if they dont agree they should just keep their mouth shut bc it does not affect their life what. so. ever. The funniest one is when they ask “how do lesbians have sex?” welp if they had to ask that then I feel sorry for whoever is dating them. Lol I could go on for days.

What do you mean he prepared for it by doing a modified low crawl? I don’t know how to swim and I’m in process of enlisting.

I'm pretty sure this anonymous muslim is just an undercover hindutva guy idealising BJP and their unjust culling of muslim minorities in India. India have been nothing but absolute shit head. They spread rumors regarding Bangladesh, they spread rumors about homes of muslim cricketers that were burned and made it seem like it was hindu household, just to paint a wrong picture in media and many more. And I can vouch that the “rape muslim women and make India Hindu again” is a BJP punchline, not muslim, but the punchline of hindu extremists. I have no respect for them, and just a few days back they opened a dam in the middle of the night without prior notice and flooded many district in Bangladesh, and many people died, hindu and muslims boths. Where is their humanity now? Domestic violence is something requiring attention despite all religions, and this guy is nothing but spewing bullshit besides bathing in it.

Dude, in what world XD your personal experience does not total the whole tall woman demographic. In fact, it is you all “short queens” who are after the tail of tall women, as is evident from all these answers: “size of a man” “The Hulk” psst grow up (pun intended) you guys sound so immature trying to fit in your demographic in these answers. And you sound like a “pick me” by creating divides based on your imaginary feuds with tall women. We don’t really give a damn.

Should a parent watch over their 8-year-old child whilst bathing if the child keeps coming out of the bath covered in soap? What if the kid feels embarrassed about the parent seeing their privates?
Depends. My daughter is 8 years old and just completed a mile stone of taking a shower solo. I told her her that it’s time to see if she could successfully shower without assistance. It went well. She was concerned she might not have rinsed a 100% but that’s okay. She is learning and will get better over time with verbal reminders. She does like me to wash her back but today I told her to do her best. Ask your 8 year old if he/she would like help. If they answer no, respect that boundary. Verbally remind them what to wash and rinse well. If there is soap or conditioner in the hair that is obviously hard to hide, have the child get back in there and rinse A second time. It’s inconvenient for them to do so especially when they want to do something else. To be honest…If I had not rinsed well en…

I wouldn't be able to do it. Lol I'm Mexican and I just pull my friend aside and mention that I don't eat meat but appreciate the offer. I mention that I'd be happy to eat some sides or anything without pork, chicken or beef. I eat seafood but that's as far as I am able to eat anymore. If I don't eat something I'm not going to make myself sick trying to eat it and true friends would understand that.

This. I went to a Coco's, which had shutdown a few months after we went, and there was a long dark hair in my Alfredo toward the bottom of the bowl. I told the waiter and they called over their manager who said I probably put it in there because it was not hers or the waiters and the cook didn't have long hair. I had red hair at the time. I was already cranky and tired because I had gotten out of work and I also had just thrown up because seeing someone else's hair in the food I just ate half of made me super nauseous. We paid for our meal and were offered a slice of pie before we left because “their kitchen was closed and we can't make anymore food"". I just wanted to leave. I was already fighting off tears and a breakdown from stress at work and the situation. My husband felt so bad. Lol If they had just owned up to their mistake it wouldn't have been as bad but them calling me a liar when I clearly didn't shove a hair into the bottom of the dish on top of puking was the tip of the iceberg that day.

When I was younger, someone called CPS on my mom and she was told by the social workers that my brother and I needed to have separate rooms. We are a year apart and we were about 9 and 10. This was in California in the late 90s to early 2000s. I guess it all depends on the person who actually goes out and is checking on families.

I was debating on doing my own makeup for my wedding but a friend of mine made a great point he said, “you'll have enough to worry about that day let alone trying to get your makeup right yourself. “ My makeup was gifted by my amazing mother in law but it was worth it. I just had to sit there, try to relax from wedding day jitters and not worry about anything like why my wings aren't coming out straight. Lol Someone also did my hair. I know myself and how frustrated I get when I'm trying to do something perfect so it helped a lot.
All the women I've known in my lifetime have gotten their makeup done professionally.

I tip after they come usually in cash because our food has been stolen way too many times. I've had a woman driver answer my call when she completed my order and pretend she couldn't hear me when I was trying to ask where she was because we didn't get our food. I could hear myself echoing on her end over her speaker. She hung up on me and declined my calls after that. It was an expensive order so I guess her greed got the best of her.
If you don't accept my order, that's totally fine but I'm not tipping until after what I paid for gets to my house and in my hands.

I am worried this will be my brother. My brother has crippling anxiety. He is going to be 23 soon, he just quit his job of 6 years because of his anxiety, he has quit school 2 times, and now he’s on academic probation.
It’s been very hard for him, but it has always been really hard for my family, especially for my mother. I hope he can find his way in life because he can’t live with our parents forever.

See my neuroscience program isn’t like that. We never had to memorize pathways (except for Biochemistry class). i had to take a 4 credit neuroscience research methods class where we had preform PCR, western blots, cell splitting, cell staining, mouse brain slicing and staining, microscopy, etc. That class was the hardest class I have ever taken.
My curriculum is also missing coding. Although they introduce R in biology II lab and you practice with excel is statistics. But yeah, that’s It’s not enough.
I think that a lot of people do not know what studying neuroscience is really like because it’s so interdisciplinary. Definitely look deeply into the classes and program before applying.

Hi Kale it’s me. I’m going to be a senior in college soon! Crazy, right?
I was going to apply for a PhD in molecular neuroscience this fall, and well.. I realize that I absolutely hate bench work. I might look into more clinical/psychology side of neuroscience, but as right now I’m not pursuing a PhD nor do I have any desire to go to medical school.
Luckily, my parents are very supportive of this decision. I’m sorry that you’re parents are pushing you to keep pursuing a higher education. You’re so smart and young, Kale.

Hi Kale it’s me. I’m going to be a senior in college soon! Crazy, right?
I was going to apply for a PhD in molecular neuroscience this fall, and well.. I realize that I absolutely hate bench work. I might look into more clinical/psychology side of neuroscience, but as right now I’m not pursuing a PhD nor do I have any desire to go to medical school.
Luckily, my parents are very supportive of this decision. I’m sorry that you’re parents are pushing you to keep pursuing a higher education. You’re so smart and still young, Kale. Stick to your gut and have faith in yourself.

If mentally ill means permanent to you, then no. The happy news is that is recoverable. With the right mood stabillizer, and giving yourself the chance to reboot, it is something generally obatained by severe stress plus how you respond to things. OptimisticOptimistic.

What does it mean when someone tells you they love you in a dream?
I had a few dreams about the same guy id been in love with since the day i met him. But after a while one night after we got closer and closer i slept and dreamnt of being beside him in bed(where i was with him 3hrs earlier) and he told me he Loved me. I yearned to hear those words for years. The only dream i ever had with him saying it. I do believe it was a yearn, because id held onto the idea of him opening up to me for years.

I was abused sexually as a child by mother and her drug addict friends. I enjoyed and loved it. My father was mean and would beat me badly so whatever my mother had to give me I wanted it. The bad thing is my mind has ducked things up and now I have a deep hatred not for the ones who turned me out but those who knew and left me in the house they be tortured.

A little backstory about me. I’m a 45 year old man who has never been married. Im terrible with women and dating and relationships have never come easy to me and they never last. I’m always rejected. I am clearly a horrible human being if no woman wants to give me a chance at a relationship. But I’m trying to fix this and have been pouring lots of resources in. I got a big job promotion recently with a big raise and pouring more money and time into self help books and courses, therapy, and hiring a dating coach and a life coach and hiring a spiritual reiki coach and I’m calling the pastoral team to help me fix things just in case it’s simply just God hating me too much to help me get a girlfriend. I’m even pouring in lots of money to update my wardrobe and I’ve bought pheromone scented colognes and soaps and lotions and hygiene products which are supposed to alter my body chemistry to where it sends out chemical signals to nearby women telling them that I’m slightly more attractive than I actually am. I joined weight watchers and I get up at 4am to work out and have lost 60 pounds. I put off taking my own life to give all this a chance. But if it fails in a few years, I truly will know society is better off without me. After all, if no woman can fall in love with me and see me as husband and boyfriend material, then it means I’m a horrible human being with nothing to offer. Just look all the happy couples around and I see all kinds of guys who can walk up a woman and never get rejected. While I’m always rejected. I’ll be talking to my therapist and the pastoral team at my church before ending things. But before I take my life in a few years, how should I get my affairs in order before taking my own life? What advice can you give me?
This is a very heavy post! OK, first off, having a physical ailment doesn't mean that God, or anyone else, hates you; this includes palpitations at bedtime! You are investing in improving yourself thru therapy, self-help, dietary changes, exercise and spirituality. Adressing your health so holistically will improve your mood, appearance and life in general. These are all wonderful things! Make sure that you also do the activities you love. Fall in love with life, first. As for your nightly palpitations, there are many possibilities. You need to work with a general practitioner to determine if there is a physical cause for this malady. Your primary care practitioner (PCP) can help you by ordering initial tests, diagnostics and specialist referrals, like blood work, electrocardiograms and card…

People sometimes make mistakes. Regardless, this was not an “oops, I colored outside the lines” mistake. This was a series of poor choices that lead to you betraying a sacred vow in a heinous way. You need to be honest about your transgression, and take the consequences of your actions. If that means family counseling and doing everything necessary to rebuild trust with the husband you harmed, then you'll be lucky. More than likely, you've caused irreparable damage to your relationship.

I’m glad your nurse focused on the baby, and that you have a daughter who survived so healthily. I don’t believe this god complex is unique to male doctors. Most doctors do want to help as many as possible; unfortunately they become inured to the plight of humanity watching so many deaths and trying to focus on saving as many lives as possible amongst the stupidity and harshness of humankind.

Details: Both myself and my friend grew up very poor and homeless at times. We were incredibly close as teens, but parted ways in high school. She chose drugs and partying, I chose to enter the military and then pursued a career in healthcare. We came together again several years ago and have maintained a less-close relationship as adults.
I have tried to be helpful to her when my own finances allowed. I've supported her at times monetarily, and took her middle child under wing to provide several opportunities. I've never expected much in return, just friendship, and the hope that the little I could give might help her keep a job or build her confidence.
To be met with such an ugly statement hurts. I don't understand why she would gleefully wager on my potential suffering.

What would you do? I am 44F, and a relatively successful RN. I recently learned that one of my lifelong friends 47F was making bets with her boyfriend 45M that the man 36M I'm engaged to would drain me of my finances and leave me penniless.

So today I came to school with my shirt tucked in, and like almost everyone that passed me in the hallway stared at my tucked shirt. I felt so self conscious. I don’t really have a belly though. What’s going on?
Maybe, in your school others dont tuck in.
Or maybe you were so conscious that yu may be over thnkng that all eyes r on u. Acc to social psychology we tend to thnk that ppl r looking at us more than they actually r

What should I do? I am 34 years old, unemployed, single, I live with my old parents, I have social anxiety, I am afraid to go out. I have no money for medication and for the therapist. My English is not good to work online, no one is helping me.
First of all, Do not put yourself down and Do not compare yourself to others as that would break your confidence. 1. Upgrade your communication skill * Learn English and improve speaking skills as that would give you a competitive advantage and will land you a decent job as that's would make it easier for you to climb the corporate ladder. 2. Be Confident (if not fake it till you make it) * The technique to being confident is to try to recall any of your previous achievements that you have to endeavour, doesn't matter whether it's small or big. You have to be in that moment of achievement that you have achieved. As this would give you the “let's do it” kinda things and by this, you would be able to make the first impression as the best impression. 3. Try to make friends/meet more people * It's hard somet…

It is not the oppressed's responsibility to educate the oppressor. It is inappropriate and triggering to be asked to educate those whom hurt us.
However, I'll give you this: Our disdain for men is not a generalization based on one bad interaction. Our disdain (or more accurately, the need to protect ourselves) arises from years and years of perpetual and pervasive misogyny and interactions with men who feel they can dominate us. The effect is cumulative. You are a member of a population who has done a lot of damage and continues to oppress women. We would rather feel safe and live harmoniously with all of human-kind, but most of us have not had positive experiences with men (often starting with our fathers and brothers) and are now in self-preservation mode. No one is looking out for us. We have to do it for ourselves. Hell, we even have to fight misogyny within our own sex and gender!! Yes, many of us have become hypervigilant, but for numerous valid reasons.
So, rather than asking what is wrong with women/the oppressed, ask what is wrong with men/the oppressor and the society that breeds this corruption. You are not the victim here.

What should I do about my brother refusing to invite me to his wedding because I haven’t gotten the vaccine?
You should either get vaccinated so you can attend, or stay home.
What answer are you looking for here? Permission from strangers on the internet to breach your brothers trust and wishes by attending unvaccinated?

The only thing I would disagree with here is the overgeneralisation that chihuahuas and other small breeds are “never” suitable for families with kids. It’s just not true.

ok so I have been talking to my boyfriend for 5 months and we just started officially dating about two months ago. When we first started talking I was unsure if I wanted to be with him; however we would speak constantly. There were two instances before we started dating where we fought and he insulted me and blamed me for his bad actions. Eventually we began dating and since then he has not done anything bad or been mean to me. The other day I caught him looking through my messages him. I confronted him and he promised to never do that again and said he only did it be he wasn’t my number one best friend on Snapchat. My boyfriend also insists he sees me every single day and texts me all the time. He gets upset when I suggest that I sleep alone. He insists on driving me to class and picking me up (although I do appreciate not having to take the bus). He offers to pay for everything and buy me the world. I’m just not sure if this is normal or cause for worry.

What are the symptoms of anxiety?
When you overthink and it leads to inaction. That’s anxiety in its most basic form. Giving yourself time to think before doing is a good thing. But when overdone then it becomes a counterproductive, unhealthy mental habit that feeds your fears until you realize you don’t want to do it anymore. All of a sudden you’ve created ‘imaginary problems’ in your head which makes it more difficult for you to move forward. “What if they don’t like me? / But I’m so awkward / I might be terrible at it.” The antidote: Conscientiousness. “The mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.” (Robin Sharma) Discipline your mind. Do not let it work on its own. When you are aware of your own thoughts you can learn to stop overthinking at will. Like any mastery, it’ll take deliberate practice, but it is one of t…

So then why do people criticize Jews for being adamant about not allowing Palestinians to have equal voting rights? I'm sure they're afraid what happened to Lebanon will happen in Israel and it will eventually become Arab Muslim majority.
I live as a minority in the US and honestly speaking, I pray it stays secular as a Christian majority country even if I'm a South Asian Hindu minority. I don't want it to be Muslim majority in the very distant future or ever. If that happens, I feel the secular nature of the country will disappear.
I don't see Arab Muslim majority nations accommodating non-Muslim views on secularism or laws of the land. All Muslim majority countries, for the most part, try to be as Islamic as possible, so I wonder why Non-Muslim majority countries are so quick to accommodate sharia law and lose their secular nature.

Do some men hate feminism? If so, why?
The primary reason I know why feminism is hated by anti-feminists is that the anti-feminists feel that feminists are asking for special privileges for women. The special privileges feminists want for women are the rights men have enjoyed for centuries: access to work, property ownership, control of their own bodies, voting rights, wage equality… the list goes on, but it pretty much boils down to equality with men under the law. For anti-feminists, these equal rights are special rights. This is not the case for feminists.

How come Indian Supermarkets like Patel Brothers and Apna Bazaar sell beef and other meat products when they have pooja items and murtis sold in there markets? At same point the workers who stock the beef and other meats could also stock pooja items.
Indians or South Asians aren't just Hindu, they come in all different religions and subcultures some of which don’t have any issues with beef and other meats. Sadly, Indians have no knowledge about other religions and subcultures of India.
When it comes to a business, religion and political views don’t decide what is sold or offered by the business. Plus, Patel Brothers doesn’t just cater to Indians, they also cater to Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are majority Muslims.

I've been struggling with a similar issue. I love my fiance so much but im starting to realize I'm more attracted to women.
.I decided to stay with him because I do still love him weve been together for 9 years and I do have an attraction for him still. If you feel like you don't have any strong romantic feelings for him its better that you end it so that you can both find someone you can truly love

What attracts introverted men?
Introverts are attracted by things that do not interfere with their personality in any way. An introvert would be glad to spend time with less talkative person who does not disturb him/her with noise. So, socially introverts prefer nerds as friends. In a relationship, an intro would want to be associated with a person who is secretive, low profile and who likes indoor fun. Although introverts are not anxious in public settings, they have great tendency to make use of their own time without mingling with the external world. Such tendency may create boredom or loneliness and thus an introvert still would be willing to have a gf or bf whom he can spend quality time with.

Where I'm from, neither glass or alcohol are allowed on the beach. I think this “hack” is saying to switch out the Listerine and vodka, and give the vodka good coloring so it looks like Listerine — basically, it’s how to sneak alcohol onto the beach with minimal risk of getting caught.

This was all too interesting not to comment. INFJ here, just to specify. It really sounds like you’re just arguing about the logical fallacies of using specific cognitive functions while de-valuing others. Of course an INTP has a problem with an INFJ using Ni- INTP’s devalue it!
Let me compare this to a mathematics analogy (I’ve got a masters in pure math- and we’re talking about thought algorithms). To me, INTP’s thinking is kind of like a proof using induction, one step building to the next until the conclusion has been reached- like going up the stairs, one step at a time. That’s fantastic- very logical. If you wanted to prove 2 million was even, you could count up by 2’s until you reach it. QED- Fantastic. Or you could notice the pattern (Ni)- that it’s in the form of 2n. Much quicker way to reach a conclusion. In this analogy, the inductive proof (INTP) will most times be correct (yes- you’re human, you make mistakes too), but it takes forever, and they can’t even reach some conclusions. Finding the pattern will usually be correct, but of course the chance for constructing an erroneous pattern is higher. The trade-off being that INFJs can also reach conclusions more quickly, which has value in itself- especially for dealing with people in the present moment or theorizing ideas in general. INTP’s also need enough valid data to even reach their conclusions at all. Here I might compare INFJ’s to using a telescoping type proof to fix that problem. (It’s partially a judger vs perceiver preference difference too).
My long time best friend, whom I adore, is an INTP (female); the person that I spent the most time with this year is an INTP (male). I truly love how consistent you all are. But- your social skills lack! I’ve had to bail you guys out so many times. Inferior Fe, and polar Se- you’ve not got a strong a sense of the social aspects going on around you. You barely (if at all) notice when you are being offensive, so why would you notice when others are? An INFJ can hardly NOT notice it (Ni-Fe).
Plus, just because an INTJ says that they wanted to be mean to the kid because he looked like Joeffrey, doesn’t mean that the INFJ will devise their feelings the same way. It’s Fe-Ti axis vs Te-Fi axis. Decisions just aren’t made the same. You, who is on the same axis as the INFJ for decision making, didn’t mention feeling the desire to be mean to this kid- rather you liked him for what he did (being a hoot- Ti-Fe). This is because Fe-Ti axis makes decisions based on how the person is treating others (Fe) and that is basically aided by whatever subjective logic frame is built up in the person’s mind (Ti). INTJ was probably right about their own vendetta (Fi) showing up in their feelings about the kid. INTJ’s are endearing like that.
Also, the kid really may have been a jerk before that and you simply didn’t notice. Kid’s behaviors do 180’s so much (lots of great neuroplasticity). Also, some kids behave better for men, and some behave better for women. It’s a pattern that I’ve had many of my teacher friends tell me about- and noticed myself too. My money is on her having some information (probably picked up via Fe-Se) that you didn’t about the kid.
In sum, saying that INFJ’s are illogical just because they don’t use the same “Proof type” as you is a bit irresponsible. If I tried to only use inductive proofs, there would be a whole lot of things that I simply couldn’t do. Additionally, INTP’s subconsciously use a lot of Ni too (socionics). So your logic structures are built on your subjective thinking (Ti) and your subjective experiences (Si) with a swift undercurrent of subjective intuition (Ni) to boot. What I’m saying is, your logic is very subjective to your personal experiences- just as INFJ’s gut feelings are subjective to their own experiences. This really seems like the pot calling the kettle black. You really hate people going along with their gut feelings because you devalue Ni.
Every type has its thinking flaws, INTP’s are no different. To say that the “sore thumb” of an INFJ is a thinking flaw is kind of… it’s just your personal preference! Everyone has a thinking flaw! I think that you got the intent of the question incorrect too. Did you answer the question? Yes. Did you just answer it with a complaint that INTP’s have against anyone who doesn’t value Ti above all else? Yes.
On a side note, guess what type of mathematics problems that I had to assist INTP’s with? Ones involving patterns (Ni)! =)
Feel free to counter any of this. I wouldn’t mind clarifying certain points. I realize that I can sometimes jump from A to C, but skip mentioning B.

Why would someone who cheated on you, and after you left them, they found new awesome partner very soon (and they kinda liked comparing this new partner to you), contacts you occasionally even after a year, while still having this new relationship?
He's a narcissist, wants to keep you on a string so you'll be available if and when the new girl figures out he is evil. He feeds off your attention and the comparisons between you are a classic behavior. :(

Every pet I've ever had has slept in my bed, usually under the covers. Some of them even like to lay their heads on the pillow. Currently we have 3 small dogs and they are no exception. Nugget likes to burrow under they covers and snuggle alongside my back or belly. Millie likes to stay on top of the covers at the foot of the bed or up on a pillow between my husband and myself. Beau, the baby, sprawls on top of one or the other of our chests or heads even.. They keep us warm and derive comfort and security from being close to us. I would never have it any other way.

❤️ hang in …just keep holding on, hold on through the pain, even when it feels like it will never end, because it is a cycle, exactly as you said. I sometimes forget that myself. That's why it's so important to reach out to others wunderstand, like you are here. Because this life of manic highs and lows can at times cause us such deep anguish that we just want to get off the roller coaster. But, remember, it's all a wild ride and we are just a turn or a hill away from the next ecstatic joy. Even if it's brief moments, you will feel joy. Pain, after breaking us down, builds us up. It's just more dramatic for those of us who suffer depression. I'm holding on with you. ❤️❤️❤️

When Frontline plus stopped working for our dogs (after 15 years of excellent flea and tick control) we tried 4 other top spot treatments and ended up finding the most cost effective and almost total eradication of fleas with seresto collars. Purchased directly from authorized dealers only. There are a LOT of counterfeits out there and they can be dangerous.

What are some tips for keeping a journal of your therapy sessions?
That’s a great question and one that is such an individual process so take what I offer with a grain of salt. One thing to consider before taking notes may be asking yourself “what makes me want to journal in the first place?” So that you can get an idea of what structure and ideas you may have about the direction of journalling you’re headed in. For example, have you agreed with your therapist some exercise aims that might take a more structured, day-by-day journal shape, or if you are working more fluidly and often tap into the depths of your imagination, perhaps you’d try using a big blank journal where you can scribble notes and layer magazine images or colour drawings. If you’ve got an idea of what type of journal you’re drawn to, another question would be “what is holding or what would…

Why would someone stop therapy suddenly in the middle of their sessions without telling their therapist?
This strikes me as a question about what is unsaid between therapist and client. I’m imagining a client who regularly attends therapy and perhaps all’s going well on paper but one day towards the middle of their contracted relationship, they leave all of a sudden, no email, no voice message, nothing. Getting the obvious out of the way first; clients can face uncontrollable financial difficulties, physical or geographic circumstances etc. but I get the sense you’re wondering about what may cause a client to intentionally leave therapy. In that respect I’m drawn to the idea of rupture and repair in that particular therapy relationship. For example: * C: “A is bothering me because I feel B” * T: “Ok so A is bothering you because of X” * C: “No no… X has nothing to do with it, I feel B.” * T: “Well B might j…

Hi, thanks for the great post! It was incredible informative :) Just wondering, what city did you end up moving to in the UK?
My partner and I are actually living in London but looking to move due to the high crime rates here (and looking for more accessibility to greenery), so are weighing options to move to somewhere else in the the UK such as Edinburgh or Bristol with its supposed better quality of life.

For me, it's not emotional expression in itself that is off-putting. I agree that in a film, performance, piece of music, an authentic moment between friends or spouses, emotion can be deeply moving and even an INTP can get misty eyed, and have genuine empathy.
When people become irrationally or plain unhinged emotional, that's when I disconnect and want to run away and disengage. There's something about immature emotional expression like whining, dramatic flair for attention that comes off manipulative and disingenuous that is also really off-putting.
It's not that we run from emotions, or never feel any. I know I feel very intense/deeply but I'm definitely guarded with it. Showing emotion denotes vulnerability and I also get easily flustered when emotion is high. I don't like feeling out of control.

I enjoy these writing moments. You're hardly feeling as if you're “working” when you're in the flow and the characters have essentially hijacked you as their conduit to get themselves onto the page. Part of the occasional magic, in my humble opinion.

I believe that many of the comments here are very helpful. Probably much more so than what I'm about to say.
As a woman (and a writer of fiction, including some spicy works) I would only like to offer up this, perhaps it might be helpful: If you're writing from a female POV or just wanting to understand more about female perception, women are very sensitive to scent. In my own writing work, I personally draw a lot on the sense of smell and describe these things, also the tactile and even the sound/timbre/volume of a voice. They are aspects of “sexual attraction” that can be quite powerful. Though, I am a very sense oriented person in general. I can only write/speak from my experience.
Hope it can be a little useful, however, the other comments suggesting having a trusty female to assist, or a writer's circle is excellent.

What are the ghouls in Fallout?
They are human beings who were affected by high levels of radiation that mutated them into the crispy, husky-voiced characters we find in the game such as Hancock, Jason Bright, Bobbi No-Nose, Dean Domino and others. They achieve an almost immortality as ghouls exist from the Pre War Era and you will meet them in the various games. Their aging process is slowed significantly from the radiation mutations that occur. Ghouls typically kept settlements of their own and lived among one another in societies (Necropolis, Underworld) because all ghouls will eventually become feral but the rate at which that transformation occurs varies from Ghoul to Ghoul. Because of this eventuality, Ghouls will live among ferals and attempt to keep them from the rest of the wasteland population. Ghouls retain the…

What did Kellogg mean in Fallout 4 when he said ""I'm just a puppet like you""?
My personal interpretation is probably the most obvious; You’re both being manipulated by The Institute. He knows the truth about Shaun but at that point in the game, you do not. He was used by The Institute for at least, approx. 100 years and you were lead to him. It can be read as a warning.
Or, you can interpret it as a hint to the “Sole Survivor is a Synth” theory.
You be the judge.

Do you believe all addictions have the same root cause?
The short answer is No. I have met opiate addicts who had lived relatively “normal"", stable, well adjusted lives and due to some unforeseen incident such as a car accident, cancer diagnosis, physical injury, etc. were prescribed narcotics and after a time of taking them found themselves addicted. There IS a distinction between physical dependence and addiction however. But there can also be a crossover where one might have begun as physically dependent and then began acting out addiction behavior such as theft, secrecy, lying about intake, doing anything to access that substance, etc. . Then you have addicts who experienced abuse, trauma, chronic shame/neglect or were people who were by temperament or personality more curious and risk-taking or had impulse control issues and gravitated towar…

If God loves us, why doesn’t he give us what we want?
This answer may seem a bit simplistic and vague, even but I always understood it this way: God expects us to depend and rely on him with love and trust that his Will for us is greater than we can understand in the moment. He does not hand out wishes, like a magic genie in a bottle or a fairy godmother. He wants us to learn, grow and seek him in all we do. That requires faith. Faith in God means surrendering our will for his. Whatever that may be, whether we understand or no.

Without context it is a little hard to advise. Are your errors with social interactions, is it work tasks or is it family? Do you have addictions or a medical condition that makes focusing difficult? Age is the normal way with dealing with things if you can learn from your mistakes.
Thank you very much for the reply. Sorry english isn’t my first language but I am trying my best to clarify. The errors that I made are usually in social interactions and doing simple activities.
In social interactions, I sometimes fail to understand a simple command. And overcomplicate a simple instruction. I am trying to think in a simple way but still it is so hard. Like when my dad asked me to do A+B, but I do A+F+I+Z instead..
When I solve math problems, I overcomplicate an easy math problem. Strangely, I solve the hard problem faster than the easy one. That is so ironic
And I also make other dumb mistakes like: dropping a tray, picking up wrong trolley in supermarket, drinking wrong coffee in Starbucks. I know it is embarassing. But when I made such mistakes, i felt as if my MIND was not connected to the REALITY. As a result, no matter how much I tried to focus and anticipated any possible mistake, I still ended up making the mistakes.

1984 is one of my favorite books ever. The best part in this book I think is the part from “The Book” which describes the politics behind the eternal wars and the society manipulation. It's easier to control people when they're ignorant and living in constant fear.
Also the speech of O'Brien is so important: Power is not a tool for making justice and progress like many people think. Power is a goal and one doesn't get power to give it away.
Finally, Orwell insisted on the importance of language. You cannot think straight with poor linguistic knowledge. You cannot talk about “Freedom” if there's no word as “Freedom” in the dictionary.
I guess there's more to learn from 1984 than what I've mentioned above.

Do you always unconsciously sit on the edge of the chair because your legs can’t fully rest on the floor?
As someone who is barely 5 foot (that is 150 cm for you intelligent people), I can surely say that I always sit on the edge of the chair when my legs can’t rest on the floor
Some exceptions is when there are ledge on the chair or table (I don’t know if this is the correct term, I mean the bar between chair or table legs to rest your feet upon), only then can I sit comfortably.

Can being a people pleaser make you a toxic person?
Definitely.
Imagine a people pleaser stuck in between two opposing sides. She will try her best to be diplomatic, avoid confrontation, and please both sides. When that is not possible, she will eventually resort to deception, or other negative things just to avoid being disliked by either side. If deception is not toxic then I don’t know what is.

Not every culture makes out death as the horrific tragedy. Some even celebrated it, which quite make sense since death is natural and will happen to everyone. For the Torajans in Indonesia,

What is the biggest misnomer of historical figures?
In Indonesian history, there are many famous historical figures, here are some of them:
Gajah Mada, directly translated, “Gajah” means “Elephant” in Indonesia. And no, our famous hero is not an Elephant.
Hayam Wuruk, which literally translates to “An Educated Chicken” (no, I am serious). Again, he is not a chicken, though I assume he must be well educated as a King.
Orang Kayo Hitam, he is just my favorite hero, how could you not love a “Rich Black Man”. This is not racist, this is just Indonesian history.
There are others, but these are some of my favorite historical figures misnomers which have puzzled me since elementary school. I don’t know about the biggest though.

How do you wish good morning to your lover?
I am Asian, so we don’t. Not really. What is even the point of saying good morning, to someone you love or not? More importantly, are there even such things as good mornings? If you are like me, you start your morning dreading your work and job for the day. Doesn’t matter that my house is filled with people I love, there is no such thing as a “good morning”. On that note, to answer your question, really a grunt or simple “hey” is enough to start the day, anything more will take too much of my energy.
People you love will love you anyway!

What is the first thing you will notice once you cut toxic people out of your life?
I felt like that weird, friendless, lonely kid. Because from my experience, those toxic people are everywhere and everyone. They can be the popular crowd or the not-so-popular crowd. I used to think only popular kids are mean, they talk about people behind their backs and made fun of them. But I have known some ugly and not popular people be as toxic as those popular kids, because they want to drag others down and make themselves look better. Those cliches about how the pretty women are dumb and the nerds are super kind? NOT TRUE AT ALL. If you cut toxic people out of your life, you will find that there is nowhere that you really belong, because everyone is at least a little bit toxic, even you yourself.

Why do some people have wanderlust and not others?
I suppose different kind of people will have different reasons for having wanderlust. For me personally, my wanderlust is a result from my urge to run away from my current situation. I feel as though currently all my family and friends and colleagues and the strangers have all become too familiar and too much. By being too familiar, I no longer feel excited about what is to come. I know who I will meet tomorrow or the next day, so what am I supposed to be excited about? Not to mention I kept being reminded of all the past mistakes that I made everyday due to the familiar surrounding. So yeah, I would like nothing more than to just pack my bags and go somewhere foreign and be anonymous. Some reasons why some people doesn’t have wanderlust might be because they are perfectly content with wher…

At the least ,i could say personally that don't do drugs ,avoid medication ,maybe you need to question your being .being, i tell you this as a one medicated for so long ,(long enough to cover two decades) ,so what I advised is more precious than doctor's medication,in my thinking psychiatry is probably pseudoscience ,and when I delve into depths of reasoning ,i could easily say the so-called “doctors” are only the gatekeepers of capitalism ,at the end if you dare to question so-called “human civilization” ,you could see that all had been ,was ,is a “SCAM”.

I'm on the verge of taking my life. How can I say goodbye without hurting anyone?
Guys, life isn't for everyone. I've suffered for 3 years and now it's becoming unbearable. Why me ? I didn't choose to be like this. Telling me it'll be better won't help. You don't understand until you've gone through it. I'm tired of the sleepless nights and of the overwhelming thoughts. I just want to say goodbye without people feeling guilty and with questions unanswered. I don't want them to feel as bad as I do. Why me ? Why ? I just wish that you guys don't ever feel like this. There's so much for you to go forward. God bless you all.

How do you say ""relentless"" in Arabic?
I would say that it depends heavily on the context. The Online Cambridge Dictionary mentions the word قاس (Qaas)
In another place دَؤوب (daʼūb) is mentioned to signify never ending!

Yes, especially if he worked hard! I wish the grades we get in touch could reflect the level of success we get later in life but they really don’t. Perhaps his area of interests lie somewhere else. Just encourage him to keep trying hard and tell him that hard work is the only thing that truly matters.

Why are some people ashamed of their parents?
This answer is going to be a bit disjointed/emotional/to the point. I’m turning 30 this year. I was raised by my grandparents since the age of seven. I don’t call my mother mom, I refer to her by her name, because she was not my mother, my grandmother took on that role. I just got married last year and she wasn’t invited. I don’t regret this decision. I had to tell my family members to hide the fact that I’m getting married (which wasn’t too difficult, I’m the only child and there were only three family members of mine attending the wedding). Reasons behind this decision: I’m not comfortable around her, I have no relationship with her, she can’t control herself around alcohol and would surely make a fool of herself and ruin my wedding, she’s bizarre and childish, unable to hold an adult con…

thanks for your feedback! I actually wanted to point this out. I've had friends that said they recovered from a mental illness, but trying to remember what it was like before they felt better as they do right now seems blurry or foggy to them. I don't really ask a lot about it because I don't want to bother them, and maybe this could happen or could be seen as a coping mechanism like you said. In my case, I was diagnosed with depression and OCD two years ago, but I also can't recall what I've felt. When I talk with my mom about it and she asks me what was like having OCD and depression…I just don't know what to say, I get lost in my thoughts. I'm currently feeling better but sometimes I still feel like I used to before, OCD it's hard to control but I try. (btw, sorry I'm not a native English speaker:( my grammar can be a bit off) but thank you once again! :3

I have come to this conclusion as well. As far as not being into a relationship. I end up really hurting the people that I love or I end up hurting so bad that I can’t function. I believe that being alone is best for me. Not feeling alone, living in a happy solitude. Lol

I’m 52 and recently separated from a 27 year marriage. I had never lived alone. I moved into my own apartment. While I missed my home for a couple of months, I now come to my apartment and smile. I can not imagine sharing my space with anyone ever again. All that you say is true. Especially having the bed to yourself. Lol. Maybe someday I will look for another person to share my life with but right now it’s a big nope.

I have a 20 year old Asd son. He practically lives in his bedroom. He goes to work, comes home, goes to his bedroom. We have to pull conversation from him. I saw that you said that this type of behavior makes you happy. I struggle with accepting that my son is happy. He seems happy enough but I still worry. Please tell me, are you really truly happy with being alone and going to work? I just want my son to be happy and if this makes him happy, I’ll stop trying to force interaction with him or between him and others. Thank you.

This hits home for me. I’ve been estranged from my father for five years. He’s and alcoholic and uses crack. He has a violent temper and assaults people around him. I chose to cut ties with him. One day I had the oddest feelings. It took me about two weeks to realize that I was missing him. The way he used to be. The way he will never be again. When he used to sing to me and play jokes and laugh. He is still alive but he is so unsafe for my family and myself to be around. I dread the day he passes away because I know there will be guilt. Also some people give me a hard time and judge me for not taking care of him. He is homeless. Anyway thank you for writing this.

I dated a guy that would act out his dreams. Slap at the air, get up and throw furniture around, cuss himself out in the mirror. If I got his attention he would yell in my direction but look right through me. It was terrifying.

I absolutely know I'm depressed, but I don't want to get ""undepressed"" again. I don't get a sense in life, but also don't know why I should end it. Can I do anything about it?
I think it's called hopelessness. You don't really want to die but you can't think of a good reason to live either.

What are your top five suggestions for getting out of depression?
Get up . Get out of the house. Walk around the block. Sit at a coffe shop, be around people. Getting up and out is the hardest part but it helps so much.

I am sorry about a few of the answers. ——————————— What you are feeling is completely normal. It is a side effect of anxiety. I know, the word anxiety is scary- but there is no need to fear. There is a word for what you are feeling. It is called depersonalisation or derealisation. They are words that describe a feeling of a more dreamlike world, one that is out of your hands. It may feel as if you are observing someone else’s actions that are not your own. Here is a link that will help you understand anxiety and depersonalisation more.

Definitely show them the facial expressions of your suffering. It also helps if you're very interactive and affectionate (to their desired level, of course 😂). I have a beautiful 6 and a half month old male ginger tabby, and he's so beautifully sensitive and affectionate to my needs, very much a reciprocation of how I am and have been to him since I got him at 5 weeks - he even “protects” me when my partner is away 😭 he's my lil ginger angel-muffin😍❤️ best wishes to you with yours 🙏💗

I can see how you got there, but I think it's more of a “show me what you'd body likes and responds to so I can please you better”
Obviously some things will be the same as exes past but that's not to say that this husband will become kme like them to her or in her eyes, you know? Sex is a lot of repetition of the same kinda of actions if you think about it. Its the personal association I guess that would make it “like her exes”. I personally would argue maybe there's something deeper if the wife feels the need to express herself like so to her husband. To quote other lovers as better - what reason does that serve, I cannot imagine a world where that would be used to positively influence change in your partner though.

I strongly suggest a new therapist or breaking off the relationship — efforts to fix it yourselves haven't worked and professional help isn't working. Either your therapist is incompetent or trying to suck money out of you cause surely they'd be able to see a mile away if people aren't compatible and the like and it's their job to tell said people.

I think you are so amazing and empowering to both NT and autistics. Have you ever thought about going into counseling or starting some sort of advice/support program? Your level of introspection is comforting. I am the mom to an amazing son, who has so many amazing qualities. He is high functioning on the ASD. Unfortunately, he doesnt seem to see all the wonderfulness that I do. I can only imagine how hard this must be. I Very much try to let him be him, engage in his intrests, and support him. We are very close. He can have huge meltdowns and doesnt see the value in school. Hes a senior and it is everything I can do to get him through. This is the area we clash.
If you were to give advice to parents on how to best support their high functioning autistic child, what would you say?

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. You don't know how valuable they are to parents of children who are on the spectrum. My son is high functioning and Is so creative, out of the Box smart, hysterically funny And such a gift to this world. He doesnt see that or wont accept that. How do I help him to see these talents? I can tell him, but I'm just mom. I want him to believe in himself more. Do you have any suggestions on how to build that selfesteem. My heart hurts for him because I know hes going through so many extra issues that are not typical. Regulating his emotions and the way he reacts to things are very extreme and I know he knows that. Social skills and anxiety play a huge role. He can tell you how to handle situations but when they actually occur it leaves his brain. He has a therapist and an autisim itinerant. Is there anything that really helped you? You are so very articulate and really seem to understand your emotions. To me that seems like half the battle, trying to get him to explain why hes upset And how to take a pause when he is upset.Any advice would be great because the way you just explained things was so spot on. How do we let our children know just how wonderful they are and it's actually the rest the world thats not as fortunate as them. I am constantly reading to him about famous people in the world that have made Life changing inventions or ideas. Most of those people are on the autism spectrum. We need people on the autism spectrum to enhance our lives.!

I'm on the fence here. My mother didn't spend shit on us, do much for us, and mentally fucked us up. Lucky if we got government powdered milk and cornflakes. Stole tampons and clothes, etc for myself among other things. Yes she barely kept a roof over our heads but I can't recall if that was the whole time we were mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually(men in her life) abused. She deserves nothing if she ever found out my drug addicted sperm donors name and managed to get back pay..fuck that

Today, started out to be a completely normal day, except for the news which turned it into not so normal.
My husband stays awake all night because he is a PHD student and its very difficult for him to continue his work from home while the baby is awake.I mean, he still works during the day, but the efficency reduces greatly with the baby jumping and running all over the place, especially when he spot a laptop on his father’s lap and shout with all his might, OOOOON.
So today, after feeding my baby, I prepared his breakfast with smile plastered on my face. Its kind of my habbit since our marriage, I always prepare breakfast, before waking him up and he always thank for everying on the plate, even though the paratha(bread) doesn't even look like paratha. He said the same thing he has said zillion of times before.
Jaan, ap ny tou kamal kr dia. Ap bht achi hen.
Life or soul(referring to me), you have done wonders, you are so good.
And then he showed me an email from his professor which left me shocked or worried. He was moving somewhere else and can no longer support his new phd students anymore. He apologized and told my husband to keep it confidential from uni and to look somewhere else for phd.
I mean he left his job to pursue his dream of phd in ireland. Leaving me and my 8month old in home country. We were in the middle of applying our vissa. He left in sept 2019 and visited us in feb 2020 because he was missing our son so bad that he decided to take a flight to home country for just 3 days before the conference . Conference got cancelled because of covid-19 and he got stuck here because of lockdown. After lockdown he couldn't go because uni( trinity college dublin) in ireland was close and there was no point in going back there, as everything is shifted to an online system.
Back to square 1. Its 3:16am and he is sitting right beside me searching for new phd positions and i just can't seem to thank lord for blessing me with such an amazing man, who didn't complain neither to me nor to his professor. He congratulated his professor for his new position and told me for hundredth time
“hey, don't worry love. I will get a new scholarship within next 6 months, till then we have enough savings. Maybe it was for better, because this time you guys will go with me. I can't live a day without you and this little monster”.
I’m happy because I’m blessed beyond measure. I’m sad because i can't help him in this situation. I’m scared of, what if……I’m worried for the man who is standing strong for my sake but I’m in love with his calmness, politeness and belief that he will always be able to provide the best for his family.

Who told you that?. Get your facts straight. No muslim on the face of earth drink any form of animal waste, including this nonsense.
The best thing about islam is its clarity.
We are not allowed to drink wine because we have to pray 5 times a day( from the sunrise till the sunset). Wine is bound to make people lose control and no one can pray while they are drunk, hence bound to make mistakes during salah.

I was glad to see seizures mentioned as well; my flight or fight is so constantly in flight mode (I didn’t know this), any trigger can cause me to dead drop (faint, but not from lack of oxygen; just a straight drop to the floor), or worse, have a “seizure”.
My seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or PNES, look and feel like an epileptic grand mal/tonic-clonic, and a video EEG confirmed they’re not epileptic back in ‘17.
Glad to read about this.

I’ve been saying the same thing since 1994. I was a freshman in college, and will never forget that day. I have never believed it was a suicide; most people I knew who followed the band tended to agree. What I find most sad is that his death is remembered before his life. You hear ‘Kurt Cobain’, and most people think of his suicide before they remember what an amazing talent he was, how he shared his soul with his audience every night, how his lyrics could change a mood, a though, a life.
I never saw that note, thanks for sharing.

My daughter is 9, and has severe myopia for her age. She is -3.0 in her R and -4.25 in her L. We put her in contacts over the summer for convenience and to eliminate goggles for sports, and her only complaint is the occasional dry eye. Contacts may help slow myopic decline in certain pediatric patients, and her ophthalmologist was completely on board.
I should note that I am severely myopic, with astigmatisms in both eyes; I’m -9.0 in the R, -10.25 in my left, and have been in contacts since 4th grade (I’m 45). Admittedly, there have been times when we just can’t dial in a diopter/axis/base for my left eye, as it has changed over the years, and I’ve changed my desired outcome. I no longer strive for 20/20; I’m 40/60 at best, with my right eye being corrected for vision alone, while my left eye has always focused on the astigmatism first, then strength.
I have never felt disappointed, devastated, or upset about my vision…maybe a little envy when friends would get LASIK surgery and have perfect vision by the time they get home! (I’m not a candidate because I lack the corneal surface in both eyes, and refractive surgery is out of my budget and my comfort zone.)
Set an example for your child and embrace the uniqueness of wearing glasses. Don’t be their first “four-eyes” bully, please.

Contact the EEOC and file a claim. I also have a seizure disorder, and ended up losing a 17+ year career due to my employer’s knowledge of said disorder. The company made so many mistakes, it was a pretty clear case of disability discrimination, but it NEVER hurts to call.

Um…I’d remove that .onion link, like, now. Most people reading this are not accessing Quora through Tor, and here on the clearnet, your referral code isn’t anonymous.
There’s a reason this information isn’t found in an A2A on Quora. Same reason why .onion links aren’t indexed by Google…OPSEC. And yours, my friend, needs to be revised.
OP, if you know what to search for, try Reddit. And if you’re using a browser that isn’t Tor, please anonymize yourself behind a VPN until you do. Just a little friendly advice.

Neither. “Finding those papers made her day” is correct for present tense; in this example, “have/has” is unnecessary, as “made” is your verb, used with an object (day).

There is a personality disorder that can mimic OCD to the casual observer; OCPD. I’ve been diagnosed with OCPD - along with ADHD, BPD, BP, and agoraphobia w/ seizures or attacks. Here’s a link if anyone’s interested:

Productivity hack: if an email/ping/IM can be answered in <2 minutes, do it then. I am almost always awake between 3–4 (daughter is a light sleeper), and if I make the mistake of checking emails, I still follow this rule.
(I once had a manger tell me to stop emailing outside business hours because it “made her look bad”. Yeah, that's not what made her look bad…)

How hard is it to get a good GPA at Purdue?
If you do the exact opposite of what I did (change majors, skip classes, discover Everclear), then it’s not going to be easy.
Tackle college the right way, and you’ll do great. Or you’ll discover a different career path, and then do great then. Enjoy - BoilerUP!

Is there any case of dissociative identity disorder that you cannot remember the timeline of your childhood memory?
The abuse for me started when I was 2 and continued until I was 12. I don't remember much of my childhood at all. I'd say I remember maybe 25%. What I do remember are more like photographs in my head and not actual things I did. Just a picture or some vague smell that will trigger an image. Aside from that I don't remember any conversations except a few. My memories don't actually start until about 12 years old. But I do still have memory gaps when certain traumatic events have happened since then.

You get 2 wishes and no wishing for more wishes. What are they?
My first wish is that myself and everyone else in the world never has to deal with crippling mental health issues. Depression, ptsd, panic attacks, personality disorders, etc would all be knocked out without taking addictive medications.
My second wish would be to have my mom back so I could just talk to her, feel her hand holding mine, hear her voice, see her face one last time and be by her side as she passed. I didn't get to do that and it haunts me.

What has been your most memorable moment in the hospital?
When my second child was born there was a complication during her birth where she became stuck behind my pelvis. The nurse I had was an absolute dream before the pushing stage and afterwards. This nurse showed me and my family such compassion and love. I'll never forget her. I started my time with her after shift change. She was in her mid 40s and genuinely loved her job. At first her bubbly personality annoyed me while I was in pain, but I was never rude to her. She was too kind to be rude to! She stuck with me so much, always checking on me, providing me with as much assistance as I needed and she was just perfect. After the difficult delivery of my baby she came in to check on me shortly after. She stayed by my bed staring at my daughter and saying how proud she was of me for how I handle…

How did your husband react when your first child was born?
He was overwhelmed in a good way. This strong tough man turned into the most gentle person I had ever met.
The way he held her and watched her was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I've been lucky enough to witness it a second time and soon to be a 3rd time.

Perineum massage beginning 4 weeks prior to your due date can help.
Having your ob apply gentle pressure while pushing, having your OB use their fingers to gently stretch your vaginal opening while pushing.
Not pushing as hard and forcefully as possible. This allows for baby to stretch you down there instead of being shoved out.

What shocked you the most when giving birth?
A couple of things surprised me a bit.
First thing was that after your water breaks you continue to have gushes with each contraction. Nobody told me this and so I was pretty shocked when it happened with my first lol.
Second surprising thing to me was that I couldnt stop shaking after I received the epidural. I wasnt even abnormally cold, but I just couldnt control the shakes. Totally normal to experience that, but I didnt know to expect it.

Is it normal for a woman giving birth to ""tear"" down there?
I've had two babies and tore with both.
First baby was 6lbs 13oz and I needed 6 stitches.
Second baby was 9lbs 7oz and I had a 3rd degree tear that required internal and external stitches.
It's common for women to tear, but not every woman does. It depends on many factors and there are things you can do to minimize the chances of tearing.

Is pregnancy really that awful? Or is it just that one thing everyone lies about? As an anxious person, I am not sure pregnancy is the right thing for my future.
Everyone has different experiences with pregnancy and giving birth. It can be awful for some but for others it can be great. I feel like most women are honest about their experiences with pregnancy but you should keep in mind that it's so personal and doesnt mean your pregnancy would turn out the same way. My first pregnancy wasnt bad. It was pretty easy and I just dealt with the normal things like morning sickness and the uncomfortable parts like trying to figure out a comfortable sleeping position. My second pregnancy began pretty easily. I did have morning sickness for the first 4 months but after the baby began really growing I felt extremely uncomfortable. She was a large baby and took up lots of space in my stomach so naturally breathing and finding a comfortable position became tough. I…

What is something you wish people knew about pregnancy?
I wish that more people understood the discomforts of pregnancy. When a pregnant woman doesnt feel like going out, cleaning the entire house, cooking elaborate meals or what have you..it doesnt mean shes lazy.
Pregnancy comes easy for some but for others it's more difficult. My pregnancies have been difficult despite having no complications. Sometimes walking from one room to the next puts a lot of strain on my body. On top of that we go through things like months of insomnia, months of nausea and vomiting, not being able to breathe properly during the 3rd trimester and just feeling not quite like ourselves.

Has anyone had a bad experience with a therapist?
When I was 15 I was in therapy due to my issues with depression, self harm, and past trauma from sexual abuse. One of my biggest issues was my mother, which tied into all of the issues above. My mother suspected the abuse that I ensured from ages 2 till 12 and did nothing. She took me to therapy twice at 12 years old and took me out because she said I wasn't cooperating with the therapist. I was severely depressed and began self harming at 14. She only put me in therapy because my high school said in order for me to remain a student I had to see someone. Ok, so at 15 I was talking to my therapist about issues. My mother saw her alone before me for a couple minutes to explain to her that i was being difficult. When I opened up to my therapist she then told me my issues weren't my mom, but tha…

Thank you for saying this. I see so many people throwing around the word depression like it's nothing. Depression isnt just a bad day every once in a while. Depression has disrupted not only my life, but caused my loved ones pain as well. Depression alters a person to the point where they feel like they have nothing to look forward to for days, weeks, months or years on end.

Can panic attacks last for days? I have been having similar symptoms for four days and I went to the doctor and they said it was a panic attack but I have never heard of one lasting this long. It feels like my lungs aren’t inflating fully.
Short answer: yes, kind of.
More detailed answer: this happened to me after the birth of my second child. I was exhausted from lack of sleep and a hard labor. I had been home for a few weeks and was still recovering. I have panic disorder but hadn't had a panic attack since she was born. It hit me out of nowhere. Heart racing, cant catch my breath, face feeling numb, I'm dizzy, etc. I freak out thinking maybe I took too much medication by accident. I call my husband and enlist the help of my neighbor and am told to call 911. They come and check me and tell me its a panic attack. Ok, fine. Thinking it was just a huge one I try to rest. The symptoms of that attack lasted 3 days after that. It's not so much the panic attack, but the leftover symptoms and fear of it happening again.

“Time to try for a boy""
My dad wanted me to have a boy so bad. Both of my kids are girls. With both he kept saying maybe the ultrasound was wrong. It wasnt. I'm pregnant again and hes hoping it's a boy, but I'm convinced it's a girl. Healthy babies is all that matters to me.

Do you lose your appetite while in labor?
I did birth the births of both of my babies. There is so much going on and pains from contractions that you simply just arent hungry.
I was in labor for 32 hrs with my first. Went about 48 hours without food. I wasnt hungry at the time, but I was starving after!
With my second I was in labor from about midnight and she was born at 530pm. It wasnt bad, but after her difficult delivery I was starving.

Why do some people put a kiss (x) at the end of everything they post or send? Does it make you uncomfortable?
Maybe they’re the kind of person who’s just so expressive and loving? They probably think it’s harmless and is a positive feeling to spread around.
If you feel uncomfortable about it, just be honest about it then. Everyone see and feel things differently. Work something out and you might be able to get a mutual agreement or balance point on this issue.
I personally don’t feel uncomfortable as I know some people use different emojis to express their meanings. However, do know how to differentiate when someone is being… sexual tho. :o You might want to avoid those haha.

I don’t really understand why a guy is starving hungry and eat a lot during the date is a problem haha. As long as the way he eat food is clean and polite, I don’t think it’s a problem. Unless he gives more focus to the food rather than talking to me haha.

Is having sympathy a sign of being weak and unmanly for a male?
No! People needs to stop genderizing emotions.
Male or Female, both are humans. Both can feel happiness, sadness, and pain. It doesn’t make you unmanly for feeling emotions; it makes you a HUMAN.
Stop reacting to people who tells you what a gender should act as. Instead, be what you want to be. Prioritize your own happiness and well being. We wouldn’t want to live our limited life just to get controlled and judge by others, would we?
Life is short, love yourself. No one can treat you better than yourself!

How much should a guy eat if he's going out with a girl for the first time to avoid looking like a pig?
Why fake your food intake in the beginning if she’ll know it after being with you for sometime later?
I don’t think the amount of food intake should be a problem. Just be yourself.
Oh, and make sure you eat politely and clean. Table manners should still be taken care of. Good-luck!

What are some wrong ways to approach a potential love interest?
Being too desperate (you’ll scare them off before you even got the chance to know what is their favourite colour)
Being too conservative (you’re not giving a chance for the both of you to have something to connect to)
Just be yourself. If it’s the right one, it’ll find its way to you.

Why do people get so upset at goodbyes?
Because they cared about the people who are leaving. And they care a lot.
Also, you’ll never know if that goodbye is the last one. Life is unpredictable, and humans are so fragile.
Just appreciate whoever in your life that cares for you.

If you were/are aware you’re hurting a person’s feelings, does an apology even cross your mind?
Everyone have a different level of EQ and mindset. You are going to get a lot of different answer for this question.
For me, I am most definitely going to apologise immediately. I’m one who couldn’t stand the fact that someone is hurting because of me. The guilt bag would be around me for a long time.
However, my partner is totally the opposite of me. If he thinks that the thing he said or action he did is right, he will not feel sorry; not even feeling apologetic.
Whether you hurt someone or you are the one who got hurt, you should be frank to your partner that you feel hurt or you should accept the fact that you hurt your partner. And from there, communicate and fix things. We all make mistakes here and there and fix them to get to somewhere. All the best.

What are the best student organizations or clubs to join at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman? Why should students join them?
The best club is the one you have passion for. There are a lot of Clubs and Society (C&S) in UTAR, but not all are that active. It’s obvious that the C&S that are active are filled with passion driven students. Their activities and events are heated and known to a lot of students. Regardless of which C&S students choose to join, in general, it’s a great platform to know more people outside of their own circle, extending their social network, meeting and exchanging different knowledges and experience with people. I personally would suggest students to try joining the Orientation Programme (in SL Campus) whether as a new student, or an existing student to act as a facilitator for the new student. It’s a great place to start. Consider it as level 1 in trying to achieve what I stated above. It’…

How do I convince a girl to do my makeup and who should I try to convince?
Just tell her that. She wouldn’t know if you don’t express what you want.
And if you already did but she refused, either you give her a good reason to, or you could just go and get some makeup yourself and put it on yourself. There’s a lot of YouTube tutorials about makeup for newbies.

What should you do if your father admitted you in an engineering college but you want to be a musician?
I’d first talk to my father about what I really want and plan in life (you do want to look like you’re actually thinking ahead for the future). If he reacted badly, I’d probably just go and complete my diploma/degree in Engineering. It doesn’t hurts to get a certificate I guess? But studying something you have no interest in is most likely going to be tough and such a suffering. However, what you studied for doesn’t determines what you’ll work as after getting that certificate. You could still be a musician. There are a lot of people who are a musician but came from a different background. It’s just a matter of how and will you go and reach out to your dream. It all comes to your priority at this point. Whether if you don’t want your father to disappointed; or you don’t want to give up your…

What strikes first time visitors as special or unusual when they arrive in Malang, Indonesia?
I’ve been living in this place for 3–4 year for education purpose.
As a student, I view this place has nice environment especially the weathers. It’s chilly almost all the time.
There are many variations of food too, hence it makes you won’t be bored to enjoy culinarily, and it’s CHEAP. so if you planned to continue your study here, it can be as one of the considerations you have.
People in here seem to be more open-minded since there are many visitors in here.
For recreation, there's a tons of choice, like Jatimpark, museum angkut, waterfall, etc.

I agree that a therapist should listen to you, and help you around the circumstances you feel comfortable in at the moment. I would first be direct and honest with her about what you feel, and literally explain why you believe that you do not want to make friends.
If she keeps insisting for you to make friends, that is where I would:
A) Move on to another therapist (search for the best fit for you)
B) Give yourself some time without a therapist and see how you respond to that. Therapy is only one way to help. There are unlimited amount of options for you to achieve your goals.
Hope this helps.

What is the highest salary a CNA can earn in his or her lifetime?
Depends where you live and what you are doing.
If you work for an agency, your pay differs based on the job.
Companies like hospitals and nursing homes sometimes offer a pay increase if CNA hours are in demand, or you may get a sign-on bonus.
I believe, in my experience, private pay with in home care patients make the most per hour/shift. Large agency companies where you travel often begin with an hourly pay of $18 and up.
I have seen anywhere from $9 an hour in nursing homes, to $23/hour in private pay home care.

Would it be a bad idea for a male to become a CNA?
Of course not. Most places love having a strong male or two during each shift to help with heavier patients. Males are also well for situations where women feel uncomfortable around men who sexually harass or comment, without a filter, (even though this is not tolerated, it is sometimes easier to avoid the room and spend the rest of the time with other patients). Bringing in a male often allows everyone to feel comfortable and as a CNA, we are very grateful for CNA/Nurse males.
In general, being a CNA promises you a job and even health benefits, and you are needed wherever you go!

What has been the most gruesome real footage you've ever seen?
Hi. Let me tell you the story of Tatiane Spitzner and how her recorded death shocked the world and opened many eyes to what exactly domestic violence looks like. Tatiane was a 29-year-old lawyer who lived with her husband Luis Filipe in Guarapuava. Looking at pictures of the couple they looked like a happy and deeply in love couple: But behind these pictures hid a truly shocking reality that ended in a horrific way. On the 22nd of July, 2018, the couple went to a party and when they returned (at around 2:30 AM) they can be seen on CCTV parked in front of their building. They spoke for a little bit and then he suddenly hit her thrice, with considerable strength, in the head. She then tried to run and opened the door, but he forced her to close it and put her seatbelt around her neck, while grabbing her by the hair and punching her head repeatedly. Then they drove to the garage, he parked the car, got out, dragged her out and pushed her against the car. He then punched her throat causing her to pass out and fall to the ground. As she laid there he parked his car and two minutes later he came back and started kicking her until she woke up and got up. When she started regaining consciousness she decided to run for her life and she started running towards the elevator as he chased her. They both managed to get inside the elevator and she clicked the ground floor button instead of the fourth floor where they lived. When the elevator opened on the ground floor she tried to run, and managed to get out but he grabbed her and forced her back inside grabbing her and putting her against the wall until the door closed again. When they got to the fourth floor she put her hands on the sides of the elevator to try and stop him from forcing her to get out, but to no avail. When they left the elevator, it was the last time Tatiane was seen alive. When they got to their apartment, the neighbours heard her cries for help but did nothing. Less than 15 minutes later the camera outside the building filmed her body falling onto the floor. He claimed that she jumped by herself, but it's clear that's a lie because in the video we can see that she was not trying to block her face or even screaming. She was lifeless when she fell. He came downstairs, picked her up and took her to the elevator where he, covered in her blood, started to caress her face and covered her breasts. He took her back to their apartment and then came back and cleaned the blood from the elevator, before driving away. Dunia Rampazzo, a prosecutor on the case, stated: Our investigation proves that the victim was killed inside the apartment by asphyxiation and her body was thrown over the balcony of the apartment. We believe the accused then took the elevator to the ground floor and collected Tatiane’s body, taking it back up to the apartment in the elevator. We suspect that before she was killed, Luis subjected his wife to a prolonged period of violent physical aggression. This was not a suicide, but femicide. The aggressor then attempted to escape by car. The case had multiple delays due to covid, but in May this year, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. If you know someone who has an abusive partner or if you're in such a relationship, get help. Her death cannot be in vain, and it'll hopefully inspire those who need the inspiration to get out while they can. Thank you for reading.

My Zoe adopted me 2years ago when I moved into my apartment her previous owner wanted to put her down because she couldn't take her with her when she moved out, so I moved in with Zoe.
Zoe and I get on well she enjoys her space. Problem is Zoe doesn't allow me to sleep late. I wake up every morning at 5h30 and feed her get ready for work and leave at 7h00, if I get back into bed on a morning that I don't have to go to work she brings home birds she catches or she jumps on top of me meowing licking or biting me until I eventually give up and get out of bed. If I decide to take a nap infront of the TV she does the same.
How do I get Zoe to let me sleep late?

Yes. This. 1000%. I have my standards obviously in course I wouldn’t do it unless I was in excruciating pain so I could care less if the floor was clean or not when this happens to me. Last resort.

What’s the worse they can do? I’m speaking as a patient who has severe bone pain that has been waiting five hours in a hard chair. Sometimes it’s not to be difficult but it’s the only option.

Thanks for the clarification. I was also wondering why they yelled at me to get off the floor when I was extremely ill. I had an awful fracture on my lower back and after 5 hours I could NOT sit in the hard chairs. So chairs any longer. I was out of my mind in pain but they didn’t care and I kept it to myself because there was nothing they were going to do. I just thought a different position would help even though yes, it was probably terribly unsanitary. I didn’t care. I just got on the floor. What can they do besides yell They yelled at you?me of course but I countered if you have a better solution I’m all ears. They didn’t.

Sadly I witnessed both. I was in a horrible hospital while in college dealing with breaking my arm and there was this psychotic woman having an huge break. Instead of treating her they just injected her with a bunch off different drugs until she stopped yelling. I interned in a psych ward before and I knew this was the completely wrong protocol! No restraints or watching her on camera. A few hours later the same staff tried waking her up for breakfast and she wouldn’t move. They kept yelling to get up but I knew the first time. It was really sad especially that none of these people were held accountable.

I don’t think anyone gets to judge Marilyn Monroe unless you lived her life and walked in her shoes. Her mother was mentally unstable causing her aunt to care for her. When she finally made a life for herself from modeling to acting, most men, directors mostly, took advantage of her and didn’t pay her anything near what she deserved compared to her men counterparts. Most deserved in diamonds is a girls best friend. Marilyn never even got paid for being playboy of the year. She paid for her mother to receive the best care. It’s not talked about often, but she inherited her mother’s mental illness as well and was suicidal about it. She took a lot of pills and alcohol which is how she passed. Albeit whatever allegations about the dirty dishes and IBS, where were the maids to take care of the dishes and sheets?

I hate being bodyshamed for being skinny. I have a GI condition that is excruciating and causes issues but aside from that, that’s how I naturally am. A bunch of random people started bullying me on my Poshmark account and even though I’m in my late 20s it’s still so cruel and degrading.

Have you ever been rude to someone and thought that you were right in doing so?
Not sure if it is considered rude. I Just responded in kind. This was several decades ago. As a child, and into my mid twenties I was naturally very skinny. Not underweight but skinny. Well, one day, I was coming home from work. I was about 22 years old or so.. This overweight woman, with moles on her face, about 50 or so, says to me-""You are so skinny, you need to eat something. You would look so much better with some meat on your bones.” Mind you, I worked at a restaurant at that time. I ate 2 meals there everyday. I had bacon and eggs, and for lunch I had fish, and pasta. And-I was going to have dinner later, at home So, her comment was ridiculous. I was just a skinny healthy 22 year old, who was naturally skinny. How I miss those days! Well, I lost it with her. I said- ""You should really lose some weight. You should eat less. You would look so much better with some meat off your bones. You should have those moles on your face checked, and removed, you would look better. Are we done exchanging advice complete stranger?” She just sat on the bench and gawked at me. The bus arrived, and she got on first and sat in the front. As, I got on, the bus, the handsome bus driver looks at me and says, you're a pretty girl. A boy about my age smiles at me. The big lady, heard the bus driver, and saw the youngman smile at me. I was just a skinny, 22 year-old in blue jeans and a Tee-Shirt, and no makeup. As I walked by the advice lady when I got off the bus. I smiled at her, and said you have a great day now. She rolled her eyes, and didn't respond. I was a bit harsh, with her, but, her commenting negatively on my personal appearance, was just inappropriate. Her making an inaccurate asumption, that I didn't eat, and telling me what I need to do, was, hurtful,, and disrespectful. I know she thought twice about what she said to people after that.

What are you talking about? Anorexia definitely is otherwise they wouldn’t consult psych in the first place. According to the dsm it is definitely a psychiatric condition. I’m not talking about appetite loss. I’m talking about being a small person already who has severe weight loss. That raises eyebrows unfortunately that strays away from my main medical issues. My doctor typical will not prescribe pain medication because it creates nausea.

It’s a joke for me. I’ve suffered for years with documented GI problems however whenever I show up to the er it’s a hit or miss situation. Sometimes they give me what I need other times they won’t. With my condition it also causes a lot of weight loss so they love to throw in a psych diagnosis of anorexia.

It might be cheaper however depending on numerous factors such as taking into account how long the flight is- I’d say 8 hours or more, which airline it is, certain amenities, most importantly if you have medical conditions where you just cannot sit straight for hours on end. Some things you can’t put a price on. I’m not an extremist and say blow $20k for emirates but a practical price especially if you have the capability to use mileage to upgrade.

It’s hard to pick one.. I recently had a tech picking on me. I don’t know why she didn’t like me but she was a straight up bully. I have serious GI issues such as gastroparesis which constantly flares and causes extreme vomiting. When I was admitted to the er I went to the bathroom and all of a sudden she starts banging on the door telling me to get out. I was literally hovering over the toilet saying lady don’t F&ck with me. I’ve never been more furious in my life. I ended up reporting her to hr. I’ll find out later what happened.

I’m trying to figure out if my mom has dementia or a “selective memory”. She does not use I statements, take any accountability for mistakes made on her part, however Will apologize with complete sarcasm and turn the tables. I don’t even consider them mistakes at this point. It’s was pure negligence in my case letting me go so long without physical care because school was more important. Yes I graduated high school at the top of my class getting all A’s. Yes I went to an Ivy League. But at what cost? I am 31 have severe kidney failure, osteoporosis, gastroparesis, etc, because as a kid she refused to listen to me if something was wrong. “Yes I was making up all my ailments as early as 3 years old” if anything I can stay it made me stronger to deal with such a person like that from the start.

I mean, I hid my meth addiction from my boyfriend who I lived with for 2 whole years before I finally broke down and told him.
He said he had no idea, but that he wasn’t exactly that surprised when he thinks back about how I was always so energetic, able to work 3 jobs without a complaint, and how little sleep I needed to function normally compared to most people… lol.
So, unless you’ve been smoking it around him or being blatantly and obviously tweaked out, maybe he just thinks you have a quirky personality 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have been trying to figure out why I am the way I am my entire life. Constantly trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Or if there even is anything actually wrong with me. Maybe I’m just more weak, less adequate, less worthy of a person than most.
I relate pretty heavily to every single one of these. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember so I was confused at first, because I just considered them my norm… even though my norm also consists of knowing that these traits make me feel the very opposite of “normal”.
Anyway. It was oddly comforting to read this list, written by someone else, when it feels like it could have come from my brain. Thank you for taking the time to write it.

What do you remember about your first relationship?
I wouldn’t call my first boyfriend a relationship. The middle school stuff is just puppy love. My first real relationship was in high school. We lived in the same neighborhood but went to different schools. He played football and was super smart. My parents loved him. Not as much as me of course . We went on dates, walked around the neighborhood, snuck in some hanky panky when our parents weren’t home. We even made love in a hotel room when my parents took us to a fancy NYE party/dance. He left for college a year before me. He stopped calling and writing letters as often and I panicked and broke up with him. That aaa 30 years ago and he has kept up with me all these years. He’s married and has a beautiful family wile I’m still struggling with fear of abandonment that has affected my curren…

Only after a year and three months of the year was no contact. We both changed. I worked on myself the past year. He worked on himself. We are both more ready to acknowledge on our own issues and we communicate much better. It’s falling in love all over again. He is even more romantic

Should I expect an ex-narcissist to come back after he’s had me blocked already for 3 weeks? He’s never done this before.
Why would you want a narcissist back? Focus on yourself and work on becoming the best version of yourself. You have to look within to find out why you want to return to a narcissist. He’s probably with his new “supply” (someone who uplifts his ego) and will pop back up in your life when you’re not giving a care about him l, him, after she’s left.

What are the signs of flirtation that girls miss?
Sometimes girls just don't see the signs especially when they are not used to being flirted with. If a girl is approached by a guy I feel like she should try to relax and maybe see what he's thinking about. If she's given a hint of a date or something else it might help!

Do you feel bad about telling lies regarding your ex?
Depends. I guess I consider an ex exactly that no longer my problem. Spreading rumors about someone you used to care about is immature. I wouldn't recommend it. The best revenge is living your life happily. Doing things that make your life incredible. Being a bit more spontaneous or whatever you enjoy. Don't feed into the feeling you may have of wanting him/her to suffer like you are move on is the best answer.

I always wanted to describe what happened, but never found the words. Thank you for giving the words to my story. No one ever said anything, he was there for a few month, months, and only an eye contact was enough. We both knew it was special. This happened while I was also realizing how emotionally abusive my husband of 8 years has been. I needed that person to help me think of me like I never did.

Wow, out stories are so similar! I am constantly conflicted and confused too. My man cares for me like no other and makes home a safe haven for me. And then, when I am comfortable in our little world, he criticizes me and acts indifferent all the time. I lived in guilt for not doing enough for 7 years. He uses power and control whereever he can. He offeres and offers and pulls away just in the end. We are married for 8 years now and I am recognizing his abuse now when he stopped me from going to work and asked me to prioritize family. I now know why he never wants to communicate with me. He is internally (maybe subconciously) witholding. From what I ahve read and understood, some people feed from negativity. They create negativity so they can live in the only environment they have known. My husband has lived in such negative environment growing up. I am on a dependent visa, so I cannot go anywhere yet. And he knows if he gets green card, I will leave him. He has said it himself. So he is not even trying to get greencard. So my only plan is to do my master’s and get my own visa.
but while I am working towards my goal, I am conflicted everyday. I am confused everyday. I still blame me. On good days like today, I feel shameful for my thoughts and plans. But I am hoping will know better in coming years.
please connect with me in private if u ever want to talk. I am seeing a therapist to overcome self esteem issues, among many other things. Consider that for u too.

I feel it is important for my son to have a sibling. We live in a very lonely world and I wanted him to have that one person who could have been his best friend ( like my sisters are for me). I understand there is a possibility of siblings not getting along.. but I didn’t want to deny a close bond to him based on that possibility

It was discussed before marriage! He said he wanted 3 kids. But he got into financial planning and early retirement. And now he plans to retire at 55 with x amount of money in his account. Another kid means he will to work another 10 years. So he is denying me happiness now for an unforseen future.

Well I have no intention of having a kid if my husband does not want it. And still mine tracks my period, uses condom and made me take plan B twice to make sure it does not happen. I could have lied and not taken the pill.. but well.. I am a reasonable person stuck with a selfish man 🤷‍♀️

Being genuine is about being genuine. What you are proposing is that they pretend to be genuine, which is counter-intuitive to actually being genuine. You rely on the presumption that the person is an attention seeker, or something else similarly negative.

Yes absolutely get help! I cannot stress this enough, unless you are on of the lucky few who are so mentally resilient they can deal with these things. I am not one of those and from the sounds of it you aren’t either. The thing is you’ll never know if you need the help if you don’t actually go and get help. Stuff like this, especially from a young age, can damage you without you even realising. So yes, go get help!
I am so so sorry this happened to you. You’ve made the first step by asking a question on here. Just remember that you are the victim, do not feel shame or guilt about it, as it was something out of your control. Believe in yourself and be strong.
Wishing all the best.

I completely understand where you’re coming from - but all of the negatives you have described can be applied to any form of entertainment, literature, TV, music they can all cause the negatives that you describe.
So yes you are right people can use them for escapist reasons (even though I actually believe a level of escapism is normal and necessary) and other negative reasons but I wouldn’t blame video games or any media, it’s more of a human thing.

Actually you couldn’t be more wrong. I can understand that a lot of people hate hip hop because it’s different - and has a bad reputation, however to say that Kanye has no musical ability, even if you don’t like his music is absurd.
I can appreciate that the topics that Kanye deals with can on the surface appear meaningless and money orientated but that is just the nature of his life. He is a strange, unstable individual who has made various odd life decisions, but to dismiss his music on those grounds just doesn’t seem like anything other than you don’t like his music.
Also Kanye was originally known for actually being a producer, so you know, he actually made his own music. Obviously as time has gone on he has involved many other people to help him make his more recent work - so I can understand questioning his musical ability based on how his recent music has been created, but originally he did fully produce his own music - and I just can’t see how you can claim he has no musical ability when lyrics and voice aside, he actually produced the rest of the music which to me actually demonstrates that he has at least some level of musical ability.

Although I understand how evil narcissists can be - I wouldn’t really suggest doing any of the above. Move on, be the better person, be blunt and honest. You made a mistake in being with them (even though it really isn’t your fault, I detest victim blaming but you do need to accept that you were part of the relationship).
Narcissists aren’t healthy, mentally stable people - and should be treated as such!
EDIT: I am young and unfamiliar with being in such a relationship so please accept my comment as a purely personal perspective.

How do you prove to your ex that you are not a narcissist, without looking like your hovering? I was a drunk and drug user, sober since our breakup. It's been well over a year without her and I've never experienced this type of pain and emptiness.
Simple answer unfortunately, you don’t. it doesn’t matter that you are sober now - because that isn’t the you that she knows. The best thing you can try and do is move on and accept your mistakes. I’d suggest looking at getting some therapy or at least visiting a doctor and describing your feelings of emptiness. I can only speak from experience and offer you my perspective, maybe she would like to reconnect, maybe she doesn’t, I really can’t tell you what to do. Personally I would go no further than sending her a message and apologising. Do not expect anything - the more you think about her the worse it will get and unfortunately this was just part of your development as a person. I apologise if I sound negative in any way - but honestly I believe that the past is the past and you can’t change…

What can I do in the next half-hour to make myself less depressed?
Grab a drink, preferably non-caffeinated with no sugar. Put some nostalgic music on. Sit outside. Dress comfortably. Focus on your breathing. Think of everything you do have - not what you don’t have. Think of your family, your pet or your friends (if you are blessed enough to have any of those things). If you feel like crying, let it out. Let your emotions out, just release everything and be in the moment. Of course none of these things will fix your depression and I truly understand from personal experience that when you are depressed it is incredibly hard to make yourself less depressed and just by thinking about it can make it worse. I find reflecting upon my life, my experiences, the good and the bad can help. Understand that you are who you are, there is no easy fix, and if you didn’t…

Whenever I think about a particular thing my heart tighten and I feel a pain in my heart . Even if my mind is diverted, I just cannot shake that feeling off . Plzz can someone tell me what is my problem?
It depends on what that specific thing is. If it is something negative, which I strongly presume it is, then it could definitely be to do with anxiety or event to an extent some level of PTSD. Speaking for myself, I know that I have very similar feelings when my mind thinks back to negative memories that I’ve had in the past, and just by thinking of them it triggers the exact feeling that I got when the event actually happens. Past traumatic memories in particular, but I’ve found that whenever that happens I force myself to understand that the past is the past and that i need to be in the present - coupled with some breathing excercises. If whatever it is not very nice to think about, I can only suggest that you try and think about it objectively, without blame and guilt just accept it and…

What is the solution to the Palestinian and Israeli conflict?
The Israeli people must adopt the orphans of Palestine, and the Palestinians must adopt the orphans of Israel, and each must raise these children in the religions of the deceased parents. This will bring these peoples together in a just and lasting peace.

From my Personal Opinion North Korea’s aware of the danger of their acts towards South Korea and USA, but it’s only a matter of time to get more benefits from the coming agreement.

I agree with Sinan, a direct war is very unlikely between them, I think the deal between that was made with Obama and Iran will push further for more diplomacy.
Many people thinks that Iran is really a nuclear threat, Iran strugling to fix their plane and cars, it’s only a propaganda by the iranian govt in order to catch attentrion

Do romances like in the movies actually happen in real life?
Actually all the romance in movies based on a true events or human imagination, so I think it could be close enough to real life.

My Father never talks to a women with disrespect and i have the same habit. He never spoke a ill word about her with me in his entire life. Whenever i visit my father he asks how is everything at home.My Father even made attempts to forget everything even before my kid was born and tried to invite her for family functions and also gave us to freedom to stay wherever we want, but this time my wife did not wan’t to join family no matter how hard i tried to convince her.
“ who is wrong now”? His father or his wife decide yourself.

How many dads out there don't know how to change their baby's diaper?
You need to get your head in the game, my friend. As your children get older their problems get bigger and more complex. I often wish that I could soothe my troubled 6 year old as easily as I did when she was a baby. Changing diapers is something concrete that you can do to help both your baby and wife. Don’t miss the chance to fix all the problems that have an instant solution!

What are some good crafts to make with toddlers?
Toddlers are easily entertained just not for very long! It's best to have things set up and ready to go but I'm never that organized. Washable paint - Paint with fingers, paint with brushes, cut up some clean sponges (into shapes if you're feeling industrious) and dip the sponges into the paint. Stamps - Stamps and an ink pad are always a hit. Glue- Print their name in glue on a piece of construction paper. Then they can stick marshmallows/cotton/etc to the glue and 'make' their name. Threading: Toddlers can thread cheerios or colorful straws (that you've cut into pieces) onto pipe cleaners. Twist it into a bracelet. Use painter's tape to make a design on craft paper. Let your little one paint all over the paper. While the paint is still wet carefully remove the tape to show the design - grea…

My biggest regret in life so far is having children. How do I learn to enjoy parenting more?
Kids can be boring. Get them involved in things that you like to do. They are incredibly malleable. Just use your powers for good not evil.

No one tells you that sometimes these wonderful bundles of magic suck. Their dispositions can be bad and taking care of them is a lot of work - emotional work, financial work, manual work. Dude, it's a lot. Many long days will be spent trying to wipe up their bodily fluids before those same bodily fluids end up being wiped up on you. That right there can be a whole day. It isn't one long joy fest of parenting. It's a lot (if you're lucky) of little moments that make it profound.

I like your way of studying- this is similar to how I studied in college, too. You mentioned that medication doesn’t always work for you- I’d experienced this too, and after talking with my doctor, found out that most ADHD medication affects women more/less depending on where they’re at in their menstrual cycle. Not sure if this helps/is useful, but thought I’d share!

Is it normal for someone with ADHD to think about multiple topics within a short period of time?
TL;DR: Yes, sometimes. You know that feeling when you’ve read the same paragraph five times, but you still don’t know what it says? That’s what ADHD feels like. It doesn’t necessarily mean that I have racing thoughts in my head all the time, it just means I can’t focus on what I’m wanting to focus on. Sometimes when I’m feeling high energy or excited, I can get racing thoughts like what you’ve described. Sometimes, I feel more like I have a brain fog, and it’s difficult to grasp onto the train of thought that I want without it slipping away. The severity of ADHD is different from person-to-person, and even an individuals lived experience can vary. For example, we know that menstruating women have worse/better symptoms during different times in their cycle. Or, I know I tend to exhibit more “h…

Can Adderall give someone with ADHD a stimulant feeling if they are new to it?
When I was very first figuring out what dosage worked best for me, there were a couple of times that I’d accidentally taken more than needed. Being on too much addy can feel a bit exciting, like a strong caffeine buzz, but it’s not super comfortable, either. I felt like a machine that had been given too strong of a voltage- lots of energy, exciting, but exhausting. On edge, like a taut string.
On both occasions, once the addy wore off my body felt a bit sore, like I’d been dehydrated. I had a difficult time falling asleep, and my appetite was gone. It’s not super fun.

My son has been begging for a new phone. I have tried all the options, but all of them are too expensive. What should I do?
Buy what you can afford. Be open with your child about what you can and cannot afford. If they’re old enough, set up a payment plan with them.
Ie: “I can afford to front X amount; let’s see if we can find a phone in that budget. If you don’t like any of these and want something more expensive, I’m happy to pay that amount towards what you’d like. If you can come up with the rest, we can purchase this phone you’ve been wanting.”

If your adult son/daughter, who is very much capable of working and help witht he house finances, doesn't want to work out of pure laziness and expects to get everything form others, would you let them stay at your house or would you kick them out?
TL;DR: Kick them out. Communicate and set clear boundaries. Help a family member out if you can, but know the difference between helping and enabling. ___________________________________________________________ I had this situation recently with a younger brother. I was torn. He didn’t have a job when he came to live with me, and no savings either. No problem, I’d said, first month’s on me. He was a 20 year old young adult (I was 24) with incredibly adverse life experiences that have left him with little to no experience with the “real world”, but had worked simple jobs like fast food and janitorial positions. No sense for the worth of money. No problem, I’ll help you put together a resume and apply to jobs. Let’s talk about how to budget, how to grocery shop when you’re poor, how to cook simp…

Does Adderall make you more motivated and confident (ADHD)?
Adderall doesn’t make me more motivated or confident. It makes my brain quiet, and more functional for modern purposes. I’m definitely motivated to get my job done- I like my boss and co-workers, and completing my job makes work easier for them. I like the sense of accomplishment I get upon completing projects. I particularly enjoy having money to spend on things like food and housing. But sometimes my brain has other plans. My lack of attention isn’t a lack of motivation. It’s a lack of “flow”, or consistency. Starting a task isn’t a problem, but staying on task continues to evade me. Before my diagnosis, I relied on extensive checklists and reminders, and the occasional nudge from a co-worker. Adderall alleviates the need for those extra systems. Adderall doesn’t add motivation- it just mak…

How do I deal with an ADHD child?
It’s encouraging to see this question asked. As a heads up, I do not have a professional background in treating ADHD, so what I have to say is all anecdotal. Both my twin brother and I were diagnosed with ADHD. He was diagnosed around 14, I was 24. Here’s what would have helped: Pro-active Monitoring: In my brother’s case, he was never taken in for diagnosis until he was really struggling in school. He got help after everything had gone wrong. I wasn’t diagnosed, because I managed to squeak by. It took until I was to my breaking point before I got diagnosed, and got help; it’s made a world of difference, and I always wish that I’d had help sooner. If you are a parent and you think there’s a chance your child may have ADHD (it’s highly heritable), keep an eye out for the signs, and get help be…

Exactly! It’s like getting a controller to “life”, but with better setting than you had previously. It takes a little bit to adjust to the new sensitivities, but overall makes for a much smoother experience.

What did it feel like the first time taking ADHD medication?
Note: The first medication I tried was 10mg of Adderall at the age of 24; I am a 130 lbs female. The first time was definitely the most “intense” reaction I’ve had. You know all of the white noise that’s surrounding you right now? For me, it’s the hum of my laptop, the wind in the trees outside, the air conditioning blowing through my home. But if I really listen, I can hear cars in the background, the occasional airplane, even myself breathing- all white noise that I normally filter out. Adderall was like taking all of that noise, and with the snap of a finger, silence. I’d become so accustomed to all of the different thought channels that were running through my head, and all of a sudden, it was quiet. It was just ‘me’ in there. Like tuning the channel on a radio, I could direct my thought…

Thank you for the advice!
Luckily(ish?), I don’t really have credit nor have I ever depended on it, so I don’t expect too many additional issues there. The name I’ve chosen is Americanized/Anglicized in it’s spelling.
My main desire in changing my name is to get rid of any trace of my existence elsewhere, in order to dissuade dangerous/stalker like family members. Unfortunately, I don’t have enough evidence to take to court, and am worried that if I were to do so making my current location public would only put me in more danger, so for now I’m keeping things quiet. I already keep most of my online interactions under alias, but wanted to go one step further just to sleep easier at night.

I learned about this early 2021 around my 30th birthday. I have been under the thumb of the same Narcissistic foster parent (mother) for 25 years, and NEVER have I been allowed to speak the truth or my mind or have a back bone. I remember being backed into a corner by her and her friends being severely abused and hit and beat on as a child. And unfortunately, I've carried that trait into my adulthood, until I woke up at 3 in the morning in pain and went to the ER and found out I almost had a heart attack or stroke either that day or week, and then found out later on that week I developed BOTH Hashimoto's Disease AND Graves Disease (thyroid diseases) and that it's REALLY RARE to have both diseases, and then realized after doing research that it all has to do with using my voice, and that my foster parent was trying to take away my voice and literally kill me. I'm still sick, still have to take medication right now, but little by little I've been using my voice and finding the strength I used to have again. In fact, when the Narcissist foster parent came to see me for my 31st birthday and started stuff, I was able to call her out (which infuriated her) but left me feeling more powerful speaking truth to her lies. But yes, dealing with a Narcissist CAN and WILL put you in the hospital if you don't do something about it.

Honestly, I left her sorry behind in Orlando and dropped her. Went No contact PERMANENTLY.
For YEARS I had put up with her neeed to be the center of my universe, dealt with her insulting comments, didn't wear the same colors as her or same perfumes or eat the same foods as her (etc), dealt with her making comments about me behind my back and our ""friends"" that we shared disrespecting me because of her, her therapist snapping at me for her behavior because she made up stories and blamed me for things, said she ""might"" have done stuff but it was only because of _______ (name your excuse), the list go ones and on…
Until one day, I had enough.
I remember we had a friend who worked at Disney World and we were in Orlando, and she had helped me move to Tampa, and in conversation with her and that acquaintance, I told them MY SPIRITUAL BELIEFS had changed and that I no longer held the same beliefs as then, and they froze, and THAT is when EVERYTHING changed. I saw her become possibly the worst version of her that I had seen. She became angry, asked why I couldn't have told her earlier, then started to argue with me saying trying to tell me about how ""amazing"" and ""great"" our denomination was (at the time) and that the LEAST I could have done was _______(x,y and z). And then she and that acquaintance got up, went into the acquaintance's room and slammed the door, leaving me out in the living room. I sat on the couch and thought all night. Before I realized it, it was morning and the sun was rising. I remember going over how she treated me through the years, whether it was a things done or said and I remembered them both getting up and coming out from their room and her angrily stomping around, wouldn't look at me and put shoes on and went downstairs and the acquaintance making faces at me and closing the door and then 15 minutes later she came back, slammed a venti Starbucks cup full of tea on the table and went back into the acquaintance's room with the acquaintance. Well, I wasn't putting up with it anymore and got my shoes on, took my stuff, put it in the car, took that tea and left QUICKLY and drove my stunned and shocked behind back to Tampa. I was surprised at myself, because I never IMAGINED IN MY LIFE doing what I did or being strong enough to walk away from her, but there I was, in the morning traffic, LEAVING her for GOOD and I wasn't coming back. In the days and weeks and months that followed, she tried to contact me via email and phone calls (to which I bluntly and coldly told her I wouldn't speak to her again, I wasn't explaining anything, and moving forward we will only speak by email), her friends tried multiple times to call me (to which I ended up telling them it's in their beat interest that they mind their own business and stay out of hers and mine), and lived my life. The ex friend tried to contact me multiple times, but I held my ground. It's not say I Don't plan on giving her back why is hers, but it is to say I found my strength and I realize my worth, and I realized I don't need someone who claims to be your friend but it's not a friend. Who makes everything all about her and who needs to be a center of everyone's universe, and whose opinion needs to be the only thing that matters, Who pretends to be a leader and has followers who follow her blindly and treat people any sort of toxic way blindly. Since then, I've learned that toxic people attract toxic people and they come in groups. And I've learned who to let in my life and who did not learn in my life. And I've let go of many friends, and family members, and I have found the strength and self-esteem to be able to make better friends and make better decisions in my life. So I went cold turkey that's what I did with her. I cut her off permanently. For good. I don't know if my story could have helped you, and I don't recommend that everybody do what I did by cutting people off, that's just what I do if that works for me and that's within my personality to do so, and to treat someone coldly and bluntly and to remove them from my life. But I do recommend that you do what's best for you, to remove anyone in your life who is toxic and negative, including friends. And I definitely encourage you to find a method that helps you because you don't deserve having friends in your life who are not loving or supportive or who don't care about you. I hope this helps ❤️.

Why am I wrong to fear that people think that I’m incapable?
You're not wrong for fearing that thought, it's normal to feel that way. But if you're letting it stop you from doing what you can, from living life, then yes, you are very wrong for that. What others think of you and does not matter if they are not there supporting you or encouraging you. Essentially, what others think doesn't matter. Do you think you're capable? If you do, go for whatever it is you want to accomplish . If you don't, only you can sit down and really and truly think over that and figure out what is holding you back and why the opinions of others is tied so strongly into it and affects you so strongly. I will also add this: Not believing in you and your capabilities holds you back from so much in life and all that you can accomplish for you. Never allow the thoughts and nega…

Can you say you loved someone because you accepted them for who they are?
Honestly, I think I loved my boyfriend semi-shallowly, but when he saw all my flaws and faults, and accepted me, and I learned all about him and found myself still accepting of him, that's when I truly fell deep in love with him…Not just his looks, or the fact he's from another country but the fact that I love what I see deep within him. We both have our bad days, where we could go anywhere from annoyed or frustrated to asking to just have some alone time to release and refresh and then come back to each other the next day. I'm learning to grow and so is he, but in spite of it all, in spite of all our errors, we still love each other very much and feel we are each other's perfect match to do life together with.

Why does my boyfriend ask me about my period?
My boyfriend just did this to me. My periods are irregular, and so I have PCOS. When they come, it can be painful. For me, he wanted to understand why I get mood swings or act aggressive or during that time, how he could help me feel better instead of me being depressed. I think your boyfriend (and this is just an assumption) is just showing he cares and wants to understand what it's like so that maybe he can help you feel better when it comes and to take your mind off of it as much as he can.

Why is it so hard for people with Major Depressive Disorder to keep our rooms clean?
I will answer this from my own experience : As someone suffering from dysthymia, I have become slow in many things. Cleaning is one of them. A clean house does actually make my head clearer so I should really do it more often. Still, it's rock hard. Why? Let me explain. I am living a pretty isolated life. My husband is off to work everyday and works overtime hours many days. I am pretty much home alone every day. I do have friends but they just live a little far away for me to see them often. I don't mind being alone as I'm introverted and like my own space and silence. Cleaning often just doesn’t bother me. Like many things in life don't bother me. I am thinking alot about why I am alive. Don't get me wrong- I am not suicidal- I just wonder a lot about my purpose on this planet. I am very luc…

What is something that someone said to you during your grieving that stuck with you?
I lost my first child at 25th week, a baby girl, fetal demise. I delivered my baby the next day after we found out. Umbilical cord twisted. We cremated her and had just picked up her ash. Mom was in Vietnam at the time. I called home but she already knew the news from my aunt who lives in the States and near me. She asked and I will never forget it , but for knowing her character, I was not surprised, she said “ What did you do that the baby died?”

Your mom’s friend, I’m not surprised with what she said. The majority of Vietnamese elders have no sense of honoring their loved one’s pride. For them , if you’re the kid (the young one) you must obey whatever the elderly says, even if it’s the most absurd thing. I do not like that kind of mindset. And I also like the way your mom handled that woman her friend. Your mom stood up for you. My mom would have sided with her friend and scolded me if i talked back like that. That’s the way my mom and a lot of VIetnamese moms were and still are. Well I don’t speak to her much. But good for you. The confidence of a child most of the time comes from the way she/he be treated by the parents.

Are people with mental illness truly aware of their mental illness or do they believe everyone else is the problem?
Unless the person is psychotic (having an episode where they perceive reality differently) or narcissistic (expert at externalising blame) they would generally accept that they have a condition that is not anyone’s “fault” but rather just bad luck. Thinking that it is not their responsibility would more likely be a personality trait rather than anything associated with the illness itself. Note that awareness falls on a spectrum and can be influenced by the length of time following diagnosis. It took me years to accept I had bipolar but I never blamed anyone else for my suffering even when I didn’t think it was caused by a mental illness. Lumping everyone in the same category and assuming they will respond the same way is akin to generalising that anyone with a chronic physical illness will…

Why are bipolar people considered crazy?
I don’t think it’s fair to say that people with bipolar are universally considered crazy. Psycho-education can help people without the condition to understand more about it and be more understanding around why people act the way they do. Madness is in the eye of the beholder.

Thanks Kenneth, thanks for the response and I do agree, I think “reason” would have been a more appropriate word choice. I guess the core of this is she is taking it as an excuse when I see it as a way to explain how I am affected by my negative thoughts. It’s not right to take these out on her. I’m having a min-melt down about how to either resolve this or let it go. Thanks for your input. Even though mental illness is invisible it can still impact your thinking/behaviour, right?

FYI the situation with the length between mood shifts is more complex with “ultra rapid cycling” used to describe rapid shifts of mood for bipolar sufferers and “ultradian cycling” now used to describe shifts occurring over cycles as short as a day.

If you read between the lines you’ll see he obviously did have a drinking dependency whether daily or whatever. Alcoholic is just a label. Unless you’ve been in a relationship with someone who is abusing alcohol you may not understand the ramifications for the person involved who has to watch a loved one slowly kill themselves.

My ex boyfriend of 3 years and I have been on again off again most of that time. My main issue was his heavy daily dependency on alcohol (although he is high functioning and never violent). However the emotional games that came with his getting drunk sometimes bordered on emotional harassment. While I was the one to end it six months ago we never broke off contact and continued seeing each other and sleeping together. I started hoping to get back with him however he is now neither wanting to move forward nor communicating he has closed the chapter... saying he doesn't know what the future holds and ""I haven't given up though I'm not holding on"". The truth is I'm far from over him and pretty much still in love with him. Is he just playing mind games with me and how can I hope to move on without the external feedback I think I need (ie: him saying he doesn't want to ever get back with me)? I feel unable to make the decision to move on when I feel like there might be still a chance with him. I know this sounds convoluted and it's a simplified version but I just wish I could know what he truly felt and if he is playing tricks on my heart so I don't waste any more of my time pining over him. I have recently stopped contacting him but it's hard when I feel like we might still have a chance at a future together. Being in such an unhealthy relationship has made me doubt I'm worth anything more, hence the wanting to go back to him for what is comfortable and reassuring.

Does a thing exist, if we don't have a name for it?
Existence is not determined by language. Language does not determine existence. An example of this is the concept of untranslatable words. What has a name in one language may not have a name in another. The English language has one name for “snow” while some Inuit dialects have over twenty different names for it showing that this phenomenon is important to their culture. This does not mean that more types of snow exist where they live but reflects the variations of snow that the observing culture notices. “Mokita” is a word in the Kivila language spoken on the Papua New Guinean island of Kiriwina. Loosely translated it means “the truth we all know but agree not to talk about”. In English we don’t have a name for this but we still know or are aware it still exists. For example one might say “…

How do Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day compare?
So they are up there in my list of bands I love.
Sum 41- Is questioning the world. (The hell song) But has this self deserved anger (still waiting) or sadness (without you) to help provide meaning or searching in life.
Blink 182- Ok let’s make light of real life issues. I don’t need to grow up (Whats my age again) I just wanna do me (shut up) blame my family for who I am (reckless abandon) (anthem part 2) I can’t change nothing (dammit) I’m fuckin sad (Adams song)
Green Day- all I need is me and I love it (Boulevard of broken dreams) (still breathing) (give me novacaine) (brain stew) (basket case)

Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
Nurture. Environment is active and conscious, nature is hidden. Or so for me that’s how I feel. Imagine being born with the most desirable genes and traits, but you go through hardships your whole entire life , the traits that are most valuable to you, of course will stick, but the hardships will cause great havoc in traits that are vulnerable.

Real answer is no. Once legal, it’s ur mind that stops you. Your parents are going to tell u how they feel, u can respectively validate it as well as getting the piercing, by letting them know it is you and you are legal age, and you hope not to upset them.

Another right here 🤚🏻 trust us all when we say nobody gives a flying fuck. Also trust me when I say, those who don’t give a fuck, will at some point begin to when they repeatedly get accused of something and have it shoved down their throats. So please don’t act surprised when white people do become actually begin to show hate and make attempts to “discredit” whatever bullshit you’re spewing, because you’re literally asking for it sparking these debates. All. The. Time.

Do I still deserve to be happy after all the mistakes I had in the past?
How awful could it be? Hurting someone in purpose is such a bad idea. For whatever reason it is, what's past is past. If only a time machine exists so that you can travel backward and ensure everything was right in the first place. Everyone seems to travel in time to re-do everything all over again. That's the idea of a perfect world. Get rid of the things that could probably drag you from overthinking. Try to avoid repeating the same old mistakes. No doubt, it haunts you like forever? Be thankful for what you have. The power of being thankful even when things don't go your way. Look after something or someone that can make you happy. After all, you just have to move on and be ensure to keep your head up.

Why does make up make me happy?
Drop dead gorgeous wannabe. Who doesn't? Anyhow not too much intentionally. The no make-up makeup look is quite highly desirable. It really takes a good practice to actually master the techniques. I adore people who can do good in makeup and how they can pull it off effortlessly. I dream of someday being a professional makeup artist :)

How can I keep myself together and stay up after not sleeping?
It's somehow very frustrating because all you want to do is going to bed. Your mind, body is tired but you can't sleep. Do you think you are in a state of depression? Perhaps. Probably because it leads to imbalances in chemicals in the brain. At first by trying to avoid using your mobile phone before going to bed yet at the same time you wants to do some reading. It will start to drag you by minutes to hours. While your alarm clock is set at 5.30am. Now it almost 3 in the morning. It can be so stressful until you actually woke up by the alarm feeling restless. Kick-start your day with a cup of coffee will do. Boosting up a bit even though your mind is unable to rest and relax.

Why do people hurt you if you have a good heart and soul?
Remind yourself that kindness is always the answer. We are treated somehow a good wellbeing to not hurt others. To always put ourselves in peoples’ shoe. What if? What if it happens to us, what would it be like to overcome the circumstances? We go beyond the consequences beforehand. By showing some respect I am pretty sure we will less likely to hurt people. Not everyone have the same thinking as we do and by the way of that, we tend to not involve with this circle of population any longer.

I am in tears. I can only imagine how horrific it must have been to actually witness something like that. Your descriptive telling of events brought pictures to my mind that both hurt my heart and astounded me. The suffering that poor man went through—it just wrecks me to think about it. Thank you for showing him care and compassion during his last days. I’m not very religious, but I pray he is now completely in peace.

What is the function of alkaline phosphatase, and why is it used in hematology tests?
Hello I'm just a student studying medical technology so I am not an expert but from the review material I am studying it mentioned that it is a nonspecific enzyme that is found in many tissues but it's major tissue sources are the liver, the bone, the placenta, and the intestine. From what I understand the value of measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lies not in measuring the total ALP levels but in measuring it's isoenzymes. The isoenzymes of ALP is associated with several conditions. The liver isoenzyme is usually elevated in obstructive jaundice, the bone isoenzyme is elevated during osteoblastic activities that's why it is normally elevated in children during periods of growth and, pathologically, in patient's with osteitis deformans. The placental ALP elevates in pregnant women. The…

My story is similar to yours in that we had to give up our beloved pooch, Max, due to living arrangements. We found a fantastic and loving couple who owned their own home and could take Max. We were heartbroken in having to give him up, but we kept in touch via his own Facebook page that they set up for him and all the wonderful photos of him on a paddle board, swimming at the beach and running on the sand, sharing the back seat of the cab-ute with his other house mate and pooch, being bride-dog at their wedding, the fun list goes on and on. One day we asked the couple if we could come visit after a few months and they were delighted. Max took to me and my son immediately and when we were sitting down having afternoon tea, Max would come bounding out of the house through the doggy door and straight onto my lap! We had a wonderful afternoon with them and only thank God that we met such a loving and kind young couple who were able to,take Max. We still have fond memories of Max and he holds a special place in our hearts, as do the young couple.

Wow, even though I am now pescatarian (no meat except seafood) , I enjoyed reading your answer. Wish I knew this when I was a red meat eater! For the life of me I could never cook a good steak! Sooo much salt, however friends of mine who are from Brazil always salted their meats and the cuts and taste were amazing ! Thanks for the thorough explanation and enjoyable read! Do you have a similar method when cooking fish !?! ;-)

Damn right you should smoke indoors with your windows closed. Why should non smokers breathe in your toxic fumes? We have the right to enjoy fresh air, that's what our lungs are made for , FRESH AIR! I have the same problem with a neighbour who moved in next door, all his smoke drifts over to my side where my clean washing is on the line. I HATE IT ! I have respectfully asked him if he could please move somewhere else also because I have a serious heart condition, but he stays and now uses incense sticks thinking that will make it better, pullleez. I am so mad about this as I can't afford to move anywhere else due to being on pension / low income. I am trying to help myself by living a healthy lifestyle, but the inconsiderate tosser next door makes sure that I don't. SMOKERS, PLEASE CONSIDER YOUR NEIGHBOURS, SMOKE WELL AWAY FROM YOUR APARTMENTS, UNITS ETC.

I'm a targeted individual that is going through the suffering of everyday gangstalking I too also am aware of who is stalking me. My question is what can I do, or who do I call to get justice for me, and my children who are the innocent victims of this sick way of abusing, bullying, and harassment. And in my case I have been sexually abused over and over again by this particular obsessed group. I am going to give you some names of who I know to be involved. The first person that is immediately involved as a perpetrator is Terrance “ tuggs” Winfrey age 35 location in Spokane, WA and his family located off of Greene and 4th Ave in Spokane Washington. And his family that is also located in Sacramento, CA as the Grovan family their headquarters are at Pat Grovan's house in her basement. The entire family which happens to be over 30+ members have all taken part in the stalking, harassment, and sexual assault of myself and claimed to have done this to members of my family. They are upset because I don't want to be with one of their family members which happens to be Terrance”tuggs” Winfrey. If there's any added information that you have for me please let me know right away.

Very interesting ways of looking at jealousy and how to not always be so closed minded and negative about the situation because it should be taken as a way to work on yourself in a positive light don't short change yourself and feed that negative approach to jealousy, When embracing the fact that you have this time in your life to reflect on who you are and what you want, minus all the yucky entanglements of emotions, and hatred you have for someone else. Your free from the burden of them having the reins on your emotions. Isn't that something.

Isn't being yourself the reason why you got in this mess in the first place? I know I am not fake or phony and don't have to put on an act for nobody. My emotions are real and I don't sugar coat nothing. But this must be enough to keep some people obsessed with my personality. It almost makes me want to do the opposite of being myself, because maybe it would help all of us out by them being able to learn different things to do instead of obsess over me and would also help me find peace

Very true. I look at men's shoes when I find the man physically attractive. If they have horrible off brand shoes and he's cute I find him less attractive after that. Sometimes I can view that differently as well by having nice shoes or a good unique style it can make the man attractive even if he's not so attractive style is everything.

Why was my thirteen-year-old upset when I told her that she was too old for a birthday party?
Because your a birch for that. Why would you tell your 13 year old she's too old for a birthday party? And then ask why she got upset? Not okay. You probably broke her heart. Wouldn't you want your child to still be a child and be able to do those things for her at any age. What is wrong with you?

I totally agree with you about the rate of speed ppl drive & they love to ride your bumper to get you to move, even police officers do it. It’s very annoying when ppl are walking in the streets holding signs up asking for money. I know which convenient stores to avoid due to this problem. The things that go on here is not just a Baton Rouge problem, this is happening every where. There’s a lot of racism & rude people, but we also have some friendly ppl I've ever met.

I was born & raised in Baton Rouge. I have my moments where I hate living here & times I love it. There’s a lot racism’s here, & some of the schools are awful. L.S.U is a great university, but to me it's a place to party. They have a great football team, but I can care less because I'm not a fan of anything dealing with sports. We also an H.B.U.C ( SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY) with one of the best nursing programs ( my opinion) yaay jags. It's not a lot of stuff to do these days. I don't travel much because I'm a full-time college student, & simply don't have the time. New Orleans is a 60/90 minute drive & one of my favorite places to spend a weekend. There's definitely always something going on in N.O almost every weekend & I love the nightlife there 😊. But honestly if I had it my way I would’ve moved some place else where it snows but my husband not having

1/10 ratio is quite possible for a siege war. Russia only loses more troops at close combats. Some believe the ratio can be 1/20 earlier, before Russia do assaults with melee fights today. But at worse, Russia is quite capable of maintaining 1/7 ratio.

Which race receives the most racism?
I honestly think despite any other race is white. When else can any other decent stand making joke about white guy this or that. Now that’s if you consider every one to be equal and the same at least then to say most every other race except white can’t get a group of all whites together for a movement. Yet black is by far discriminated against more so then any other race. Even there own race trust me I get it but you can’t say racism is the issue, look to understand the bigger picture here. Since so many white people run police etc, most not thinking less of your skin. Some do not like black people and they even see children of 12 years old as adults. It’s because of fear of them.

My daughter use to say my best friend autumn. Now she is saying things like my favorite color is black. What is racism then ? Is it when I look at you to see that white asian or Hispanic guy. No it’s the black guy. Sure they had more crap from police then anyone else, leave it at that. I would rather a future where my daughter was before spring break that never ended saying my best friend is Autumn and not thinking she is black or she is white so you tell me

Yet, all the “Black” Black children that are accepted into these schools has the same or better presentation as the poster. Please stop.Sadly, you are the only one to make it about race. Not surprised. The notion that in 2022, if a Black person is doing well it’s not due to Merit. Tell me how I became successful? Is it because I am Black or is it that I took the same boards as an RN, nurse practitioner and now my Doctor in Nursing Practice to become who I am? Is it because I have a tenacity for business and helping my community, therefore my private practice has grown exponentially in the last two years? Enlighten me..

All to familiar. Imagine the white family who brings the their “lost” teen for a Psychiatry appointment and realize that I’m black. Yet, have heard rave reviews about my practice. Oh, my favorite “you are “Are you a CNA?” My response “No, I’m actually the CNA?”provider.” With a smile.

Hi sir. I have a doubt. I worked as a temporary employee for 1 year in a private clinic and now working in another hospital as a permanent employee for 1 year 8 months. So now I have a total work experience of 2 years 8 months. I had no problem registering for dataflow and DHA exam. But is there any chance that I may be rejected from eligibility because my first year experience was temporary? I still worked as an employee and got salary.

I remember reading another answer which explained the reason is because people only oppose racism only when their particular race is concerned. Each person defends their own race, rather than defending another race. When you defend your own race to the point you oppress another race, that is racism.

Is Satan currently being tortured, suffered, burned in hell?
1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. (He's roaming on the Earth, and clearly not burning in Hell). Job 1:6 One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”. (Again, Satan is roaming the Earth as of now). One thing you must understand- Hell is unoccupied as of now. Sure it exists. But NO ONE is in Hell. When people die, they do not go to Hell or Heaven. Instead, they go to the land of the dead. In other words, they are simply DEAD. Just DEAD. Just that. Ecclesiastes 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but th…

What does the symbol ℞ (Rx) in medical prescriptions and pharmacy stand for?
℞ actually comes from the Greek word Χρήστος (CHRISTOS). (CHRISTOS/ KRISTOS). Christos, a Greek word meaning Anointed is the popular Greek surname for the Hebrew Messiah (CHRISTOS —-> CHRIST), but was not actually used by the Messiah himself nor his followers.
Etymology:

The first two letters are KAI (Χ, pronounced K) and RHO (ρ, pronounced R). It's from these two letters (Χρ) that we get the symbol ℞ (ρx) or RX, which is still used in medicine today (a nod to the Greek origins of Western medicine). So also is the snake and staff symbol used in medicine (again from Greece).

That’s not how Jesus would speak about anyone and you have no right to judge her because you are a sinner too (John 8:7) and you’re no better (Romans 14:1–23). Jesus taught us to love everyone and to be peaceful (1 John 4:16–19), even to those that are not Christian. Please practice what you preach.

My theory is it's a very high sensitivity of clairvoyance, but without support in learning how to control it on a spiritual level and grounding it, it can be destructive.

Do you think most mental health issues are psychic abilities that are uncontrolled? Such as people with OCD and intrusive thoughts are probably picking up on thoughts/energy from spirits or from people around them.

They are tricksters and if they cannot directly attack you, they may find their way through people you care about to try and weaken your spirit. Its so important to pray, meditate, focus on being love, being positive, and have faith because this strengthens your aura and this can shift others around you to a higher frequency as well. Also, when you are aware of their tricks, you hold more power over them.

What is the heaviest and most extreme female-fronted heavy metal band?
Probably brutal deathmetal band Abnormality fronted by Mallika Sundaramurthy. They disbanded in 2020, but she also has her new bands such as Unfathomible Ruination, and Emasculator.
Another new kick ass brutal deathmetal band from USA would also be Castrator:
Another brutal death / grindy band from USA is Harlequin. They started off as a blackened death-thrash band in early days, but are now sounding super brutal in their songwriting:
I’m sure there are many more out there who kick ass. These are just a few I can think of right now. Enjoy! =)

I've had social anxiety since I was a kid and honestly going to school made my anxiety worse, not better and it affected my ability to learn. I felt dumb everyday because I couldn't grasp what the teacher was saying because the anxiety symptoms would get in the way and distract me. But if you put me in a quiet room with less people, or alone, I'd be able to feel more calm and focus better. Everyone is different and learns differently. There is no one size fits all, but for some reason our society thinks it has to shape themselves to fit into the current system, to be one way or no way.
If i was homeschooled, I think I would have done better and got better grades and maybe felt more confident. I think I would have experienced less “trauma” each day (yes when you have anxiety attacks that is you experiencing trauma each time, big or small) your brain learns this as a bad experience which leads to more anxiety when you have to face it again. So exposure therapy, forced to do things you're uncomfortable with (like going to school), is not always the best solution for people with social anxiety.
I think you meant well for child and this is not an attack, but just a perspective. We anxiety sufferers live with this disability and so accomodations would mean the world to us, if we can take a step back from everything so we can calm down, refocus, and try to gain strength to face the next day and have the strength to seek help. I also think it is much harder for us because we live in such a fast paced society, and were not allowed to slow down and process our feelings when we need to. Then people wonder why mental health problems have been increasing. There is so much pressure and demands to succeed in everything. Work and school is important but mental health should always come first.

Is it normal that I have to double check everything before bed? Like the door, or the AC, and right after I check it I have to go back and check a few times again to feel relieved. I’m not sure if it’s normal because I get outta bed for it. Help?
It could be a normal bed time routine, but how you said you have to check it a few times to feel relieved sounds a lot like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior — the vicious cycle of OCD. Obsessions While everyone worries, in people with OCD,…

Yes, in hindsight I realized that I should have told my parents what was going on and I was very, very naive. However, being only 12 years old at the time I sadly didn’t know what abuse really was (especially emotional and sexual abuse) so I didn’t know at the time that anything was wrong. Also, he had me so manipulated that I was scared to tell anyone that what was happening didn’t feel right because I didn’t want him to get in trouble. He had me convinced that he “loved” me and that he was there for me over anyone else.
Years later when I told my mom some of what happened, she told me that at the time it was almost like I was in a trance or was brainwashed because no matter how many times she told me to stop talking to him, I just wouldn’t listen to reason. That’s actually common in abuse victims.
If I could go back and change things, believe me, I would in a heartbeat.
I wish that 12 year old me had been more educated about what behaviors from boys (especially older ones) are okay and what aren’t. Luckily, more schools have programs that discuss sexual abuse now so more children are being taught what is okay and what isn’t when it comes to touches and behaviors from other people.
Thanks for your response.

As a young adult (20) who was a disrespectful and sassy 12 year old daughter myself, I would try to calmly sit down and talk to her and let her know that you’re there for her. I’d ask her what’s going on and explain to her that you don’t appreciate how she’s been acting and that you took her phone as a result of her behavior. All behaviors have consequences and punishing her for being disrespectful and rude is fine. But my guess is that something is causing her to act the way she is. I can tell you that I and many friends I know greatly valued privacy at that age, and she may have lashed out because she felt her privacy was violated when you took her phone. Maybe ask her if that’s why she got so upset when you took it as a punishment. I always had an attitude at that age because I was feeling so much and going through so much. I had undiagnosed anxiety until I was 16 which came with depressive episodes and I was self harming and felt suicidal regularly. I was also being bullied and sexually/emotionally abused. All of these were things my parents didn’t know about so they didn’t understand why I was in emotional turmoil and being so defensive and rude to them. I didn’t feel like I could talk to them about it and when they would get frustrated with me and get angry at me for being so upset all the time it made me feel like they would never understand and that I was all alone. I’d shut myself away in my room and just wanted to be alone and seemingly never wanted to interact with them. And when they made me interact with them, I was negative and kept to myself the whole time. When they’d ask what was wrong and why I was being so rude I would immediately get defensive and get an attitude because I felt attacked. Does that sound familiar? If so, and if she won’t talk to you about whatever may be going on, I would recommend looking into a therapist or mental health professional. Even if it’s not something like anxiety or depression, your daughter may be having a tough time dealing with emotions and feelings that come with being 12 and puberty. I know that for myself, my hormones were all over the place and I just didn’t know how to cope with that. Therapists can be for everyone and don’t have to be a forever thing. Everyone can use some help coping with the stress of life sometimes and believe it or not, being a 12 year old girl can be very stressful. Now, I’d also like to mention that as a parent you do have the right to go through your daughter’s phone and see if anything is going on. And doing that may end up being necessary. However, if you choose to do that please seek professional advice on how to go about that in a healthy way because it can be really traumatizing to the child. When my parents wanted to search my phone when I was younger it was incredibly stressful for me because even though I knew that they owned the phone and had a right to, that was one of the only things I had as a teen where I had a certain amount of privacy expected and them demanding to search it felt violating. I think it’s really easy for parents to forget that it’s important that their kids need a certain amount of privacy too as another human being. I hope any of this helps and I hope that things work out soon with your daughter. Best of luck to you.

What?? I never said to subscribe to me what are you talking about lol. This is the very first time in like the three years I’ve been a member of quora that I posted something and regretfully so! I never post or answer anything I’m just someone interested in reading things from knowledgeable people. Unfortunately, not everyone on here who answers questions are knowledgeable of the subject…. ahem…. anyways, I don’t owe you a name or a profile picture and it doesn’t make me any less human just because I don’t show those things. And no need to project your lack of substance onto me, which appears so obviously in your “writing”.

Lol. And I’ve seen many people like you who structure their sentences and say certain words against borderlines like you do. The point is I was just trying to help you see something I felt you weren’t noticing and that maybe you were answering some questions incorrectly because of your negative experience. But yes I realize now my words have fallen on deaf ears and you are determined that everything you say is correct and that anything I say is discredited because I have bpd. But you’re entitled to your opinions, I just thought I could get some kind of proper response from you but you responded in the way I was afraid you would. So I understand now there was no point in trying to talk with you to try to help you understand that all the things you write about borderlines aren’t correct. I am not implying that everything you say is wrong, what I am saying though is that some of the things you say are wrong. It doesn’t matter if you’re an asshole about it or sugar coat it, I don’t care about that, that wasn’t my point… what I care about is that some of the things you’ve written are incorrect therefore spreading misinformation. And if multiple people have told you this before perhaps it’s not us that’s wrong, it’s you lol.

Look, Jason, i initially read your response to this question then ventured over to your profile and saw numerous answers you gave regarding bpd questions. It feels like you have a biased view on borderlines because of your negative experience with a bpd person. I completely understand why you’re so angry and why you feel like bpd individuals are “shitty”. However, it’s important to remember that just like there are “normal” people who are shitheads and who are not, the same goes for borderlines. I understand there are people diagnosed with this disorder that do have bad intentions and who don’t care about the suffering they inflict on to others, perhaps for those kinds of people it is too late for them, I have met those types of people before. This can be said about anyone suffering from anything, not just bpd. Some people, in general, aren’t good people at heart. That being said, and I cannot stress this enough, NOT ALL BORDERLINES ARE BAD PEOPLE. There are borderlines out there that have tried so hard to get better. Some have and some are still on that path. They do not get enjoyment from being the way they are. They don’t get enjoyment from being mentally ill and from seeing their loved ones suffer because of their unintentional wrong-doings. It may sound silly coming from me but, it’s not so black and white. I don’t want to be this way. I do whatever I can to get better. Getting better has become a life long journey. And in order for this bad stigma to go away that’s associated with those who have borderline, it is crucial that people like you don’t spread hate. Whether you see it or not, I am telling you your post sounded hateful. And you have every right to be hateful towards a person who hurt you or affected you so negatively. But to group everyone together and assume that all borderlines fit into one giant shitty person category is wrong to do. You may be stuck with the thoughts you have towards bpd people because of your experience with them, and nothing I, or anyone says will change your mind. That’s fine. I understand what its like to be so sure of something. But because you’ve never experienced it yourself, as in you actually having it, it may be near impossible for you to truly know the magnitude of how this disorder feels. I may have trouble with my thoughts and emotions but I’m still a decent person with morals and values and try to be as non judge mental as possible. My personal relationships are chaotic and I have many deep issues I need to understand still to hopefully get past this. Maybe I never will. But please, if you want to answer questions about bpd, please don’t spread misinformation. Please read non-biased information about bpd. And if you can’t be un-biased, please don’t spread hate and lies. Not every bpd is the person who hurt you.

I disagree because he will find out. It may not be now or in a few years but something will slip. If she is cheating she is not committed to the relationship. I know what I speak I lived it. Yes it hurts and is devestating but so is being deceived and finding out after the fact. He deserves someone who does not lie to his face. Hurt now or later? You sound like you have either been cheated on or are doing the cheating. That's my philosophy on the subject. If you are going behind your spouses back there is a serious breakdown in the marriage. One can recover but it's not fair to keep the other in the dark to “spare” their delicate feelings. You give the person being deceived absolutely no credit he/she can't handle it.

I’m preganant with my brother’s baby. He’s so hot and I like his muscles. It was consensual but an accident. Our mom walked in on us but she was on meth so I don’t think she saw. I feel like if I tell her, she’ll get mad at me. What do I do?
‍♀️RUN AWAY FAST - your mother is not supposed to be on Meth she is supposed to be taken care of you and you are not supposed to be having SEX with your Brother PERIOD there are plenty of good guys with muscles. You’re family is off limits have some control , No No all wrong and now you’re pregnant, what will a child that will have to endure life,with a meth grandma and a UncleDad… I think you’re being taken advantage of here life has more to offer you sweetheart

I also received genetic testing and was told my son would have Down syndrome and I would have to have doctors there when I delivered. I was so devestated because I already had children that were healthy and didn’t know how they would receive him and I did consider not having him but I prayed and prayed and even faced the fact that I would have a child that was special needs but as I kept going to my appointments every week his ultrasounds begins to turn normal and was born completely healthy. I thank god everyday . He is 5 now and about to start school this year, yes I know 5 but he will probably be my last child so I wanted to spend all the extra time I can with him.

What are the temperature control features of Instacart's delivery vehicles? How do they compare to those of Amazon Flex and Postmates?
Instacart does not have a fleet of delivery vehicles. They do not send out “temperature controlled” company cars or trucks at all. When you order through Instacart, the order gets sent out to independent contractors (aka: Moms, Dads, students, neighbors, anyone who needs extra income can sign up to SHOP & deliver for Instacart). When that order gets picked up, that person will drive their own vehicle to the store, park, go inside & shop for the items on your list, go to checkout, wait in line, bag your groceries, load them back into their personal vehicle, drive to your home, unload all bags & carefully leave them at your doorstep. Would you like to know the average pay for someone who is doing all that work AND driving their OWN vehicle? I can tell u that it’s barely enough to cover the gas…

Can you add items to an Instacart order after it's been placed but before delivery has occurred?
Yes, in fact, the Instacart app will send you a push notification after the order has been placed (but before its been picked up by a shopper) that asks you if there is anything else youd like to add. The app will also show you items to buy based on your previous order history. If your order is already being shoppe...

Can’t we do better….for Dixie and all the others?
Author Unknown “I was leaving the dollar store today and the cute little lady in front of me , alll dressed up, was struggling. She didn’t know her PIN number at the register. The man behind me kept sighing and said “Come ON” while the cashier and I tried to help her. When she was trying to leave, she asked for help trying to get the cart out the door because it had a big pole on it to prevent people from taking the carts out. I explained that they weren’t allowed outside and that I could help her. She immediately declined but looked out at the parking lot and then back at all her bags. “Really,” I said, “I would love to help.” She said, “Oh I couldn’t do that. You might not even be parked near me!” Seriously? When walking out with her, I learned her name was Dixie and she was 83 and stopped in after church and the grocery store. “These errands wear my old body out!” She sighed as we loaded the bags into car. The part that made me so sad was when I finished and shut the trunk, she asked me how much she owed me. I laughed and answered but she said, “No, I must pay you!”. Obviously, I declined and told her to have a beautiful day BUT how tragic is it that she thought she should pay me to walk with her to her car. Sparklers, we must do better. We must be proactive, bolder and deliberate with our kindness. We are failing our elderly. We are failing our young ones who will only know a world such as this. We are failing each other. Step up and go outside of your comfort zone today and just spark. Seriously! Oh…and invite your friends worldwide to our group so we can set this world on fire with GOODNESS.” Author: Unknowns Source: Let’s Spread the Kindness

60 Minutes had a hit piece on Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, but failed to disclose these facts: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the US Naval Reserve Center in Dallas Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant junior grade, to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a Lieutenant Commander in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal. He represented Florida's 6th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018. Obviously, with these qualifications, he is NOT qualified to be a Democrat, or serve in a senior political position in our nation’s capital when one considers and compares the credentials of Pelosi, Schumer, Harris or Biden. He has kept Florida free of the grip of a tyrannical federal government while our State of Florida still prospers, which is why more people have moved to Florida than any other state for the last couple years. So, for anyone who criticizes him, I have a request of you. Can you please post your education and service to our country in a resume so we can compare and put your opinion in perspective? THIS, my fellow Americans is the greatest Governor in our nation! I hope 2028 we find him in the White House...right after VP to Trump in 2024

Do Instacart drivers see ratings?
Yes, we do see our ratings, not only do we see them, a bad rating can greatly damage our ability to see future potential orders in the Instacart app. The orders we do see, if our rating falls below a 4.70, are usually the orders that no one else wants to take such as driving to the store for one random item & then getting stuck delivering the item 30 miles away with no tip. There is an upside to this, if an instacart shopper consistently receives bad ratings then it’s a great way to “weed them out” which means more orders available for the shoppers who are actually good at their job & passionate about top notch customer service!

Would Instacart retain a contractor if they only wish to shop & deliver two or three times per week?
Yes, absolutely. That is the great thing about “gig” work! You’re an independent contractor, Instacart does not extend an offer of employment. If you are able to pass the background check & have a clean driving record then you’re able to download the app to begin accepting orders. You’re welcome to log on anytime that is convenient for YOU. Once you’re logged on, the orders will show up for stores near your location. You’ll see how much the job will pay before you ever take the order. You can work once a day, once a week, once a month or all day every day; they don’t care, they just want a shopper to take the offers so that the customers get their groceries in quality condition and a timely manner which is partly why the customers keep ordering which is how we have more orders to fulfill,…

I'm his fiancee now and we been together for three years ,so yeah your right it doesn't concern me because I wasn't dating him at the time of all the chaos,I started dated him years later. me and him love each other as we should but if your my man and you love me like you say you do?why do I have to pay double because I have no dental ins. like she has with him ?their child is 18 so the bitch shouldn't be in the picture and getting support by my soon to be husband when I should be getting the discount because he is with me, should have been stopped when their divorce was finalized.she has been over.no disrespect but she doesn't deserve shit in all honesty.thanks

I don’t know if it’s comfort, it’s what I’ve seen while working in the field of behavioral health. I’m sorry that presenting it in a matter-of-fact way is disturbing to you. There was typically an incident that led to them being there, either a threat to harm someone else or themselves. Being placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold is a process that requires more than just conjecture; evidence is needed for that hold.

Hi Manny, I appreciate you explaining a lot of these intricacies. (This is not sarcasm, I know it’s hard to tell over the internet). But you did a really good job of making this easy for someone who is not super well-versed on these issues to understand. I appreciate that.

My mom’s favorite to use on me: “if you would just try harder…..”
If I would just try harder what? Will my brain chemistry change? My genetics? (Granted I do realize a certain level of “trying” is needed in order to develop coping skills and emotional regulation skills).
The assumption that I am NOT trying is insulting. This is me trying.

…thank you to the person who already said “ok boomer”, but may I reiterate: “OK BOOMER”.
Sir, I have no idea if you are a baby boomer or not, but your comment sounds very inline with something a baby boomer would say about the Millennial Generation.
Were all of the Millennials who VOLUNTARILY signed up for the military immediately following 9/11 doing so because they knew “no hardship, pain, or suffering”?
OR were all the Baby Boomers who had to get DRAFTED demonstrating their lack of desire to go through “hardship, pain, and/or suffering”.
Have some respect for your Millennials.

100 truth. The Gambino's primarily own Long Island and also have a significant presence in Rochester, Miami, some neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn along with sprouting up in Los Angeles and other parts of California. The Genovese have control over pretty much all upstate New York outside of Rochester and The Arms Turf. The Genovese are also VERY VERY dominant around Portland in Oregon which is why the Russian mob (who own that territory) are at war with them now. The Latinos are also at a turf war with parts of The Outfit and more specifically the Genovese/Lucianos in Chicago. Many of the things that the Feds say on the news is false! The Mafia is still around and have a much different kind of influence then they used to. They infiltrated parts of law enforcement on Long Island in order to have a heads up on arrests for their guys and associates. They infiltrated parts of the FBI Office in Upstate New York for the same reason. The Genovese have a significant amount of family members in the Southwest part of the country who are either in the military or are ex-military. Many of the things they used to do mutated into things like mortgage fraud, identity theft, credit card skimming, COVID-19 assistance program fraud, tax fraud and other white collar crimes because they carry much less jail time.
The Mafia is evil.

United Blood Nation.
The West Side signed itself out of the UBN. And that's, not the East Side’s problem.
The founder of the Bloods which was founded in LA, was incarcerated in Rikers with a high ranking member of the Lucchese Family. When the Families didn't want him, they exiled him to LA. From that animosity he had towards The Families he found an excuse to find another Gang “to protect the Blood Families from the Crips”. The same founding statement of La Cosa Nostra and La Camorra from 800 years prior.

Involved? You're Funny! The Gambino Family uses the Bloods Gang to do all of its hits even to this day! They would never throw one of their own under the bus unless they were a snitch! The Lucchese Family and it’s founder were in prison with the Founder of the Bloods in Rikers so they share a very special bond. The Crips are closer with the Lucianos and Genovese on the West Coast and in Chicago. Whereas, Luccheses and Gambinos are very close with the Bloods in New York and on the East Coast. In General, the Italian Mafia has allowed people in the Bloods and Crips to marry into their Families under certain circumstances like when their is strategic value. So to answer your question, their are affiliated but not always on a personal level and more on a business level.

It's a blessing to be gay. Gays dress better, have better jobs, make more money, are generally better people, happier, when they get married they appreciate it more, better style and cook better - just to name a few. Be who you are.

Why do you forgive that people are bad?
Some people like to call it good and bad people. Every good person does bad things and every bad person does good things. It's better to look at life as people who honor life and people who do not honor life. If someone got into a car accident and hit the divider in the middle of the night on the highway with no one around except you driving by would you call 911? Or get out and help? Both are things you would say a good person would do. Think about it my way and it opens up a whole new world.

It's very true what I said. Based upon the history of the Italian people. And yes, there are many other organized criminal syndicates out there but the Sicilian Mafia has the most publicity. And yes I'm from New York but my views aren't distorted at all. Everything I said is true which is supported by historical facts. I didn't add the Moor influence in there and many others facts as well because it's 2019 and we have electric here not gas lamps.

I'm Northern Italian and I've dated quite a few Sicilians. I can tell you THEIR IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TYPES OF PEOPLE. First off, the Sicilian people hated us (as portrayed in the Sopranos) because we were the Italian (pronounced E-TA-AL-EE-ON) people first hence why we say we're Italian and they say there Sicilian. Sicily was the first melting pot of the world (before America and actually was the idea for America) and a sanctuary place because the Sicilian people were pretty much thrown out of Italy because of the way they are. They were (and still are by some) considered to be dirty people for a number of reasons (not including their La Cosa Nostra and our Camorra aka The Mafia) mostly because of their darker (nigger) skin tone, whore mentalities, mistresses and vulgar language (WH…

It's a war between the real and the genuine. New York just happens to be in the constant spotlight. I was born here and have lived all over New York. I can say that Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse and Niagara Falls are all cities in New York - much different. People don't sound like they ate a box of tissues for breakfast. People might be fake nice but that's better than ruining someone's day by ripping their face off if you don't care about them. “Your such a good person”, “your such a nice person"", “your such a sweet person”. Get used to that in the beginning when you move here. That's normal. And being attacked outside your building for no reason at all. Could write the book about New York. How they (we) say people envy us for some reason any reason because we have more money then others. But really at the end of the day, they (we) are the first ones to be corrupt, abuse our power and cover it up, more corrupt cops have been charged by grand juries in New York than any other state. And hey they have pretty great food, awesome transportation, weather sucks, it's a ton of people all the time competing who takes a better shit in the toliet. It's a great place IF you need social services, have a ton of money or to work. Other than that LA, Chicago, London, Paris, Perth, Miami and Portland have better weather, nicer people and GOOD FOOD.

How do guys become gay?
The science says were born gay BUT personally I believe their are 3 types of guys that have sex with other guys. One is the obvious, attraction to men or being homosexual. The second, which is more common than you think, is when a younger doesn't have someone to look up to or to be like when they get older. Like their father wouldn't be there friend outside of being their father. Their father was not someone to look up to. Whatever else. The younger lost and find somebody who's teaches them lessons about life through taking something from them they can never get back. This happens A LOT in jails, contruction, masculine jobs and the military. It's also where the “absued becomes the abuser"" psychology was made. It's the predator and prey mentality. Some guy couples enjoy this too but, it's d…

I caught my 13 year old daughter using pads for her period without my permission. What do I do now?
I feel like this has to be a joke? If not then you, mother, need your head examined. You cannot possibly expect your daughter to bleed out when it's that time of month, onto her clothing. When my daughter was 13, she came to me and asked if she could start using tampons bc she hated the sight of blood so I went and got her some small ones and then had the talk about how long to leave them in and what not and tried to the best of my ability to explain to her the best way to insert it. You are your daughter's mother. You should be her advocate. You shouldn't have had to catch her, because she should have been comfortable enough to come to you and ask. If she can't ask you something as simple as this, then what can she talk to you about? Nothing? Do better. This is exactly why we have parent…

My husband threatened to hit me. What should I do?
Wait until he leaves for work or falls asleep and run and never look back. If he threatened it, that was just to test the waters to see if you will stay. If you stay, he will definitely do it. Sooner than later. If you don't have any money, check domestic abuse centers in your area. If you have kids together, make sure you get them to safety as well.

I will tell you what I've told my son numerous times. If a girl hits you, make space between yourself and her and keep it that way. An abusive partner, no matter the gender, is uncalled for. If they have to put their hands on you, clearly they're not the one. Move along.

If a man hits you, does he love you?
Absolutely not. It took me a lot of years and losing almost everything I had to realize this. My kids father hit me the first time when I was pregnant with his child and told me it would never happen again. Well it did! And again and again and again. I would leave and he would beg me back. After so long he thought that I would come back, no matter what he did to me. So, needless to say, it got worse. To the point of me losing everything I had, but him. And really, I didn't have him. He cheated with my friend and that was the straw for me. I was done after that. I blocked him out of every part of my life and only gave him an opportunity to see his kids, thru my parents.

Do you still live with her? And if so why not moving out? If your mom still beats you up, I'd bet she's done it your whole life, meaning she is the problem. Not you. Get away from her. I'm all for respecting parents, but I do know there are some lousy parents out there, that don't deserve to be called a parent. Don't let that control your life. There is a great big world out there, full of loving, caring people. Leave and don't look back and never ever let history repeat itself.

I'm 90 days sober from a five year meth addiction. I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and struggle to do things. When will it get easier and what can I do to feel better?
It took about a year for me to start to feel better (I slept a lot). It has been an uphill battle, but worth it ultimately, as I could not live any longer as I was.

I'm right there with you. I was with Bernie in 2016, but had to go with Hillary against Trump in the general election. Don't think Bernie is the best candidate to go against Trump if we want Trump out of the White House. Really liking Buttigieg & feel he could not only hold his own against the orange one, but replace him as POTUS. Bottom line for me, regardless of which Democratic candidate wins the Primary, is that candidate will be where my vote is going, for the sake of our country.

How does your anger affect your relationships?
Man. My anger at my junky tweeker ex is so bad that the woman I use to love is now who I send the most vile hurtful messages to and it’s tsking me down a dark hole. My energy is down and it’s pouring into the rest of my life. Anger is good when you take the lesson on why you are feeling it. It’s causing me to want to destroy her but I’m hurting myself in the process.

What is your review of Bremerton, WA?
Bremerton is a navy town. Ship port to be exact. It’s old. Run down for the most part. Lack of good jobs and rampant meth use that had already wreaked havoc in the early 90s. When we were young all we did was get into trouble. Bremerton is really a dump.

What are baby steps you can start taking to start loving yourself and what you look like?
If there are things you don’t like about yourself that you CAN change then tackle one thing at a time. Take something little that is easier and fix it. Celebrate your victory and then tackle something else that you will make you feel better about yourself. Baby steps. Accept the things you can not change and be the best most confident you that you can be!

What are some good coping mechanisms to stop someone from relapsing?
You can’t stop anyone from relapsing. For one, you cant make anyone do anything. For two relapsing is part of the process so they say, not sure what they might relapse on, but a few things are nasty, life and soul consuming and its an ongoing battle for life I have heard.
You can encourage and support them, let them know you care and help them see there is a different option.

What is the most unusual synchronicity or message from the universe you've had on your spiritual awakening?
For me it was one night when I was using my pendulum. I was watching myself in the mirror and made a strong connection with my higher self. I asked why I talk to myself like sharing my day and ideas. Myself told me it’s because I am my own best friend. Then I told me that I validate me. It changed the whole game.

What is something you want to ""get off your chest""?
I feel somewhat guilty for wanting the worst for my addict ex. Since she decided to keep using dope I want her to go so hard that she wont ever come back. I want the heroin and meth to engulf her soul and leave her wallowing in a black bottomless heroin abyss. It makes me angry but also sad I would have these feelings. My life is so good now, yet when I feel low or angry I think of her and wish nothing but her self inflicted demise.

For me it was easy. I thought things like using heroin was an instinctual no no like touching a stove. My ex began Heroin who really knows when. I looked around and you don’t even have to dig deep to see what it destroys. That is why I tried to shame her. It made no sense. I fucking hate drugs. I did lots and lots of drugs growing up. Just stopped. The lifestyle, the people, the loss, the hopelessness, the dark aybss, watching my spouse degrade. Becoming vile and toxic myself berating her over it. It was awful. It was easy to not become an addict. But I was very much an addict myself. Addicted to her addiction. In many ways she had a valid excuse. I was simply operating like an addict in darkness of my own choosing. I isolated myself. I lost much of what the addict does. She just got to stuff those feelings with drugs. So while I did not do drugs, I was very much an addict. It was the breaking point in which I changed my own life.

Same for me. I think about it multiple times a day. I feel hopeless, like the future will be terrible and I don’t want to be here for that. It’s like I’m too tired to continue trying and battling life. I constantly wonder how people would feel, would they be shocked? Feel remorse? Or would my death just be another random thing that happened ? For a moment, I’m comforted in knowing that they will think about me for just a minute.
The funny thing is, I don’t think I ever could. I’m scared of dying , just the same as I’m scared of life. Feeling like a failure, or that I’m wasting away my best years. Who knows.

I feel exactly the same way. I’m 27 and have been this way for as long as I can remember. The thought of living the rest of my life like this is depressing. I’m lonely. I do have 1 good friend that I trust and that I’m sure won’t abandon me. But I feel like I will never find a partner. I’ve tried really hard to get out there and meet guys, but they always end up hurting me. Nobody wants to be in a real relationship with me. My father died a couple of years ago, very suddenly. And my mother is very sick and needs help, life is overwhelming to say the least. You’re not alone.

I couldn’t add more details due to character limits. But obviously those qualities I described are just the first things you see in someone and do not describe me entirely as a person. I’m not looking for someone that’s just pretty, I want someone I can share my thoughts, feelings and aspirations. But I feel like I never get the chance to share more about me because guys end things after a few weeks or they ghost me.

This person appears to be asserting that a large big toe relative to the other toes may be an indication of ""nervous weakness"" that the person is attempting to conceal, maybe by being inconspicuous or avoiding drawing attention to themselves. Just to be clear, here is no scientific evidence to support the notion that the size or form of a person's toes is related to their personality or behavior in any manner.

What is the meaning of Romans 12:19-21?
It is surprising how difficult this passage is for Christians to understand, although it is straightforward when you read it with an open mind. Paul is saying not to seek revenge against your enemies. Paul makes a vague allusion to Deuteronomy 32:35, saying that any revenge should be left to God. He then says that if we go out of our way to be good to those we consider enemies, helping them in any way possible, we will cause them to suffer burning shame (“coals of fire”) with greater effect than any revenge is likely to achieve. He summarises: Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil with good.

My Son joined right out of high school, went 0311, it was tough but he really felt like he was where he was suppose to be, it was home for him. He then was selected for MSG, passed the course and did some Embassy time, then was selected to a FAST Team which he seems to like too, but his sense of loyalty is… and always will be with the Infantry no doubt. One builds a bond, a sense of loyalty and a deep appreciation/understanding for what sacrifice and commitment means for the betterment of the guy next to you, the Corp’s and service to (and for) our nation.That life lesson can be well worth the investment of what one would put into it and conversely what one would get out of there experiences’.
However, there is something to be said about acquiring skills through other POG MOS’s, the VA working as it should and the fact you are left to pickup the pieces once your out. Though my son has had… and friends of his have had offers with major corporations offering them employment as soon as they get out for 6 figure security contracts both privet sector as well as Government both in country and out. So I see it as… make the best out of whatever you decided to do. Your training will help you move forward in life if you embrace the training use it as your weapon to go out there and make your way in this world.
And as a (Combat-Veteran myself} who served in the ARMY and have had more experience with the VA and society in general than most on the subject. I agree with the OP on his assessment of what really happens to the Vet’s here at home after all the hard work, sacrifice and hardships left for you and your loved ones to deal with can be extremely challenging. It’s a fight all the way through life, why not get to see some of the world on there dime and pick up what you can to get a running start when exit the service. As one E-8 MARINE said to me the other day, “It beats working at Wall-Mart”. Give it a shot if you apply yourself there is no telling where you might end up because there’s always opportunity if you look for it.

AGREED: Solid Perspective on Reality! Contrary to a lot of people’s belief’s, As a Veteran who has experienced/participated in a coup/take-over Military Coup/Take-Over of Government and repatriation of it’s population, it’s population. It’s my contention that it is… very possible that if the extreme shift of the Ult-Left continues to push this narrative of extremism ideology, extremism/ideology and propaganda, “our way or we all burn” type mentality, we will see those who are now understanding (maybe for the first time) it’s now or never to rise and save what’s left of this Republic and that for which it stands… they (we) very well could loose everything if they we don’t fight back with equal or greater force “you force. I believe we will end up in a civil war for a number of reasons, and I know from experience, “Sometimes it takes a wolf to kill a wolf”. The sheep dogs aren’t getting it done against this uprising of the kind of violence we are experiencing from the extreme left today. The kinds of mass rioting and civil disobedience directed at our current President, who is the legitimate Elected Government Official, is (in my eye’s) Treason and puts all of us at risk if it’s not stopped and stopped quickly. Whatever it takes to get these unruly masses under control must and ultimately will be a wolf to kill a wolf”, just being a sheep dog won’t get it done.done or we will all suffer the consequences.

I’d rather be in a foxhole with someone that wanted to join, than someone who was guilted by a total stranger on the internet, and called a coward. I think it takes quite a bit of courage to profess you made a mistake and don’t want to serve.

That’s a fair and reasonable question brother, and I’m glad you’re at least willing to consider another candidate, if available. I’m a lifelong registered republican, gun owner, combat infantryman , a Texan, and hell I have a shaved head, a beard, and beer belly! I am the stereotypical dream demographic of a Trump follower by all visual, and assumed standards. I shamefully admit I voted for Trump in 2016 for the mere fact that he represented the least of two evils (Hillary). I just as shamefully did not vote for either candidate in 2020, and will be voting 3rd party or write in “deez nutz” in November’24.
Trump ain’t no republican brother, he has masterfully found inroads to a usually silent majority(?) and manipulated that disenfranchised group of Americans to a fever pitch, he’s a genius by no means, but rather a shrewd manipulator of basic human nature of a certain demographic.
Biden is not a viable option either, trumps meteoric rise to prominence was a set of dumb luck, perfect opportunities represented by 2 of the worst polarizing democratic candidates that folks hate so much they will vote for anything that is the polar opposite of these two democrats.
I’m 55 and have never witnessed a hatred filled, vitriol controlled constituency anything near what Trump has created.
Ive never feared a constituency until trumps creation, I can take care of myself, but trump owns the golden dog-whistle. I’m sure a large majority of my associates, combat brothers, and general public will continue in goose step admiration for him.
I’m not hearing anyone of his followers saying things like “Trump is a mess but Biden isn’t a better choice,” people are “convinced” that Trump is the best candidate ever?!
Human nature, unfortunately, is very easy to manipulate in large groups, Trump has rewritten the book in this arena…I don’t even wish ill will on Trump…I’m also looking for an alternative to the two jokes that the “powers that be” have decided are the best choices.

Thank you for being a bright light in an otherwise pit of darkness. You could have easily looked the other way, ignored, or even added to their mental anguish. You chose to show compassion to souls who have no hope or even understand why or where they’re at. I wish blessings on you and hope you realize the blessings you brought to your fellow inmates, you did this for no other reward than that of knowing you were helping unfortunate souls, while you yourself was suffering the same hell. I am certain your acts will be rewarded in this life or when you pass into eternity. Bless you.

How did you get a revised bipolar diagnosis, as in being considered ""not bipolar""?
Hmm, I think the only way that can happens is if you're misdiagnosed in the beginning. There is no reversing of a correctly diagnosed bipolar human being; no pill, no special diet, no exercise regimen will “reverse” the correctly diagnosed case of bipolar disorder. However, one can function quite well with said diagnosis, in and among society, if she/he will be compliant with meds, get on normal sleep schedule and normal schedule in general, find good counseling, and know their “""warning signs” (thoughts, moods, triggers etc), and enlighten oneself with cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) when you sense a warning sign. Things won't always be great, but as with all battles in life, arm yourself well and you enhance the probability of success….or successes, as you will have back slides…..and be…

God how I wish this were so, but my experience with bi-polar is you have both depression and mania. Dunno maybe someone out there is different, but it's called “bi”-polar for a reason.

What are LGBT+ people tired of hearing?
“So, when did you choose to be gay?” My response is always “When did you choose to be straight?” the look on their faces is priceless! Haha. Also, when men preach that they're against homosexuals and then say “It's only okay if it's just girl on girl.” Then proceed to ask if they can watch or join.” HA. Men that act like that should have no right to vote against gay marriage. When men talk about how disgusting gay men are in terms of how they male love..Like, really bitch! Who cares bc love is love and if they dont agree they should just keep their mouth shut bc it does not affect their life what. so. ever. The funniest one is when they ask “how do lesbians have sex?” welp if they had to ask that then I feel sorry for whoever is dating them. Lol I could go on for days.

I'm pretty sure this anonymous muslim is just an undercover hindutva guy idealising BJP and their unjust culling of muslim minorities in India. India have been nothing but absolute shit head. They spread rumors regarding Bangladesh, they spread rumors about homes of muslim cricketers that were burned and made it seem like it was hindu household, just to paint a wrong picture in media and many more. And I can vouch that the “rape muslim women and make India Hindu again” is a BJP punchline, not muslim, but the punchline of hindu extremists. I have no respect for them, and just a few days back they opened a dam in the middle of the night without prior notice and flooded many district in Bangladesh, and many people died, hindu and muslims boths. Where is their humanity now? Domestic violence is something requiring attention despite all religions, and this guy is nothing but spewing bullshit besides bathing in it.

Dude, in what world XD your personal experience does not total the whole tall woman demographic. In fact, it is you all “short queens” who are after the tail of tall women, as is evident from all these answers: “size of a man” “The Hulk” psst grow up (pun intended) you guys sound so immature trying to fit in your demographic in these answers. And you sound like a “pick me” by creating divides based on your imaginary feuds with tall women. We don’t really give a damn.

I feel like a waste of space. I’m 18 years old and life feels like it's passing by. I can't achieve anything. I want to die soon. I’m depressed, but I can't tell anyone. They think I'm looking for attention and I should get over it. What should I do?
What helped me during those bleak, hazy days when dying felt like the easy way out was knowledge. Not the text book knowledge that comes with truckload of stress. I’m talking about the out of syllabus ones. I watched Youtube videos like the ones from khan academy, veritaseum, ted-ed and button poetry. They were my lullaby, they told me of places my thought didn’t yet wander to. And it was vivifying, for me. You don’t exactly have to abandon your computer, you could simply use it for something new, something better. Plus-point, you could watch those videos indoors. I also try to uplift others, like I’m doing now. In turn, it uplifts me, as if I was consoling myself all along. Through that, you’ll discover the hidden optimism in you, which will surprise you in a good way. These are two simple rec…

How can you forgive an ex partner for dating your close friend for 3 years after you divorced? They did not work out and now my ex partner wants to consider remarriage. How can I let go of the resentment and anger? Should I?
They have crossed the line and Carried on up the hill! They have both used up all your trust in relationships and friendships, leave both of them to rot and find new people or enjoy your own self like you've had too. They will have damaged your trust in everything you ever knew. Why bother they will do it again as they know NO boundaries!

Should a parent watch over their 8-year-old child whilst bathing if the child keeps coming out of the bath covered in soap? What if the kid feels embarrassed about the parent seeing their privates?
Depends. My daughter is 8 years old and just completed a mile stone of taking a shower solo. I told her her that it’s time to see if she could successfully shower without assistance. It went well. She was concerned she might not have rinsed a 100% but that’s okay. She is learning and will get better over time with verbal reminders. She does like me to wash her back but today I told her to do her best. Ask your 8 year old if he/she would like help. If they answer no, respect that boundary. Verbally remind them what to wash and rinse well. If there is soap or conditioner in the hair that is obviously hard to hide, have the child get back in there and rinse A second time. It’s inconvenient for them to do so especially when they want to do something else. To be honest…If I had not rinsed well en…

The generation of people who went to blockbuster and RadioShack, what was it like?
My answer comes in the form of Blockbuster goer perspective. I have been to a RadioShack back in the day. Like childhood days mostly for my brother, who loved building and racing rc cars. I remember going to Blockbuster as a teenager and young adult. You knew it was the weekend cause I would get to pick movies that I could not see in the theater. It was great because that meant pizza night too! You would go hoping you got a copy of the movie you wanted. Newest movies released would be sitting 20–30 copies thick. I remember when it was like 10 copies of the latest and greatest. It was great browsing movies in real life. You happened upon movies you forgot about, or movies you loved a kid. You call to your significant other to tell them all about it hoping they will want to watch it with you.…

My daughter does the same. She says to me and my husband, I miss you. This happens all the time. He could run an errand and be gone for 10 min. As soon as he walks through the door she behaves as if he had been gone for days. She says I love you all the time too. By ‘all the time’ I do mean like every couple of hours. She needs constant reassurance.
For example: My husband works 12 hours 3–4 days a week. While he is gone this is our typical conversation.
4 year old: Daddy’s at work today?
Me: Yes, he is working today?
4 year old: He is coming home?
Me: Yes, after work he is coming home?
4 year old: I miss him.
Me: I know you miss, but he is going to come home.
An hour or two later this conversation will be repeated throughout the day.
Then dad walks through the door.
4 year old: Daaaaaaaaaddy! I missed you! You were at work today? I love you!
I think Mr. Flom said it. My daughter needs constant reassurance about where dad happens to be at the moment. She is very much a daddy’s girls and a mother hen. Mother hens need to know where everyone is at that very moment.
As annoying as this might be right now just amuse her with you answer. No one is getting hurt. You are strengthening your bond and relationship with her. Its beautiful!

Thank you, I really needed to read this right now. I've been there, lost, and am in recovery. Some days are ok and some are overwhelming..I'm having one of those days when you realize how trapped you and your kids are, and that there is no escape from the trap that was set into motion before even meeting the person. It's literally nothing to do with me, but I feel like I'm being force-fed someone else's bullshit. It's a lot to swallow.

Wow, what a change from my experience of a MALE child protection (officer), who unsurprisingly, sided with the father, and together they've sought to take me back to the 1960s. It's so, so bleak.

I went through this too recently, but with eyes wide open once I realized I was in the devalue phase. I found that even though I knew I was being played with (future faking, intermittent reinforcement) I finally threw in the towel when I learned first hand that I had been triangulated, with a previous fwb, and most keenly, because it was made clear that the hang part of our meeting up, the talking, was something to be endured prior to getting what they came for. Npd sufferers seem to always tell you what you don't want to hear, but need to, albeit not intentionally.

Jesus, I'm so sorry; I cannot fathom the pain and anxiety you must have felt. What a smallminded and obscene desire to destroy….I wish for you that your nemesis could proceed to shed his layers of destruction and reveal his shamed, tiny self little by little, perhaps wearing a nappy and sucking on a dummy in his mouth….or maybe he could shrink a bit each day, Benjamin Button style, or even better ala Lily Tomlinson in the Incredible Shrinking Woman, a film from the 80s… I'm not being funny, but hope my odd reframing of the threat generates a something resembling a smile? You deserve happiness. I'm rooting for you and your family; tune and turn that ass-clown out! What a waste of humanity.

I do think it's worth remembering when dealing with someone displaying narcissistic traits that their subconscious “wizard behind the curtain"" may still be chasing after what they didn't receive when they were 5, 6, 7 etc. I don't know if it helps relations between oneself and the other person, sometimes I think, yes, and sometimes, nope, but I noticed that if I'm able to reframe their godawful, hurtful, antagonistic behaviours through a compassionate lens, this at least gives me a break from thinking about/climbing back aboard that broken-down, house of horrors, shitshow, ride without end, the “them!/it!/why?/when will they stop?/pls make them stop…/when will I stop expecting normal behaviour from them?” pain train continually running in my brain.
I am almost at acceptance for myself; but it's seeing the affects of this person's blindness about themselves, the damage it's doing to our children…I've never felt a pain like it.
(Sorry, I got a bit carried away there…pls let me know if my comment is a fauxpas, I'm new to contributing.)

Do narcissists sometimes speak to their girlfriends in baby language?
At the start of my relationship with my ex, he very quickly employed cutesy nicknames for me, the same that he used later for our children when they were babies, and beyond, almost in an ironic sense as they think of themselves as being “cool kids"", nearly “big kids"". I remember at the time the cutesy nicknames made me feel diminutive, feminine, coddled, and appreciated. I met him when I was picking myself up off the floor, after being repeatedly discarded and then hoovered by someone who I later realised displayed the characteristics of a covert narcissistic, who seemingly resented me for knowing my own mind, and being comfortable in my own skin. The nicknames became sinister when I realised that my ex routinely enfantalised me and habitually tore into all those qualities of mine he profe…

Thank you for sharing your own personal experience of connecting with your younger selves in different stages, and expressing how reparenting can lead to integration; I'd not thought about chronology before. I was wondering if you have any recommendations about how one can best go about doing this work? My usual approach in achieving positive change is something like this: start with research, lots and lots of reading, attempt to put new learning into practice, usually self-guided, and with limited success. I've read about and find appealing guided inner child hypnotherapy; is this considered effective?
A few hours after reading your post, I found myself pondering negative events from my childhood and wondering if any could be deemed injurious enough to impact me now, when suddenly a traumatic event from when I was 3 years old revealed its magnitude to me in a way it never has before…. yep, I reckon there's quite a bit to work with in just that one happening on its own. Had I not read your post, I don't think I would have registered how impactful this thing has been for me, subcnsciously…now I'm feeling like I really need someone to work with on this stuff, as I'm not sure what to do next…

This…
“But you know what, parent, the fact that we still try shows we truly don't understand, good. It's not a game I'd ever want to win, to win would be our death. So don't be mad at yourself because you are still normal and good and don't know the inner workings of the deviant mind …to truly know it would make us just like them. So be happy your still making mistakes handling them!”
Thank you for your post, and especially your statement above. I am on my case after each negative, awful exchange, for believing normal relations should still be possible, and that I have only myself to blame for expecting reasonable, respectful, and humane treatment from the one and only person on Earth with whom I chose to create new human beings.
I really am starting to feel like compassion is the key to getting past it, for both myself and for them, because as much as they cause me to suffer, I would never want to walk in their shoes nor feel the magnitude of their suffering, and to feel this way, I am grateful.

This might seem odd, but when you're in the middle of it and doubting yourself, wondering if you're being too xxxxx, try this…reverse the genders and see how you feel about his words and actions when you reframe your positions in the opposite sex: Guy has surgery and would like his girlfriend to be around to help him deal with the as yet unknown consequences, or pain management, food prep and moral support. (You may not actually want him in the bed with you, but you probably will want him nearby). But his girlfriend has other plans, she's planning a night out with the girls…so what if she sees them every weekend, he's gonna be just fine, all by himself, facing the unknown…he might need urgent medical treatment but you know, he has a cell phone…you'd at least expect the girlfriend to arrange a substitute stand-in, wouldn't you?
Now see if you feel like you're asking too much…
The only way to beat a narc at their game is not to play it. You deserve someone who is healthy in heart, mind and spirit.
Lastly, if you cannot say that you yourself are that, healthy, how about saying as sweetly as you can to those people who are getting in the way of your health that you care for them & wish them all the best, but can they now politely f-off and never come back.. this is your time, and you need it.
Instead, I would ask your friends/family to break up the weekend into shifts and be on hand for you. It's ok to ask for help, and most people feel good helping people that they care about.
I bet anyone who loves you will do this for you without hesitation.

I always try to keep this thought in mind, when butting up against what walks, thinks and quacks like a duck; they too, feel that they are the victim, just as much as I feel that I am, and that the pain they inflict is done so in self-defence. It's hard to muster compassion for a person so seemingly determined to destroy one, but it keeps me from giving in to their narrative, and from giving up.

This is the best explanation and guide for how to avoid narcs that I've read on quora; thank you.
I've been feeling stuck i.e. no longer trusting my judgement due to the sheer numbers of collected cluster-bs past and present, and somehow forgot that ultimately one can experience pernicious vapourous self-worth & yet still make choices in line with that of a person unencumbered by wound baggage; here's hoping fake it till you make it does the job…
(Am debating internally if I should give up my quest to find the smoking gun/a-ha moment/figure out how to be whole, i.e actually care about oneself without feeling cringe…the a-hole within still snipes and shies away from truly going for it in fear, but who cares? Everyone has one, after all. Or is there a key to authentic wellness that I lack? As far as I can tell, I'm just the latest output of dysfunctional families and their trauma, being punted from one century into the next. I have compassion for all of my ancestors, myself included, but how do I translate this into proper mojo?…sighs)

Thank you, finding your wonderfully written post was so serendipitous, for me, as I'm currently swimming against the tide and trying to keep my head above water. I've been trying to support one of my sons who claims his dad bullies him (which I've seen firsthand), and who's response has been to start a smear campaign against me with anyone who will listen, including the school, rather than engage with his son. It's quite exhausting and your post has really helped me regain the long-haul view, in that I stand by my intent and actions and am happy to let what I have done speak for itself. Thank you again.

Hi Victor, I just came across a few titles in Amazon regarding the vagus nerve, and wanted to ask you about the therapy you mentioned. Is this something one can do unaided, or does one need to find a practitioner? Is there a book that you'd recommend as a guide or intro to it? I have similar traits to those that you describe, I think. Not sure where to start, as it does seem a kind of whole being problem.
——
(I reread my post which follows, and though it was ‘fun' to write, my first on this site actually, it's not necessary for you Victor, or anyone to read, as posting my questions above doesn't beg for a why, but seeing as I've 'finished' writing it, I'm gonna go ahead and post it anyway…)
and, breathe…
About 2 years ago I started having fainting episodes known as vasovagal syncope, often in response to stress. If I had to come up with a narrative for why I started having these episodes when I did, I put it down to my body telling me that my usual approach to living life; aka running on fumes, well, it was done with that and I needed to change it up, as this bag of bones, sinew and skin wasn't gonna play that game no more.
Now I feel like I'm in a stairwell, trying to work out which floor I need to get to, and how many more flights up it is... And my ex, suspected-npd, he keeps shouting at me whenever I'm close to choosing the floor, confusing me with brain fog, despair, and invalidation, preventing me from building the life I want, rather than the one I found myself in. I started measuring in days how long it takes me to recover from one of his txt sessions (min 3 before I can sort of function normally).
I had hoped that our kids wouldn't become targets, at least not yet, but nope, that hope is toast. They're single digits still, in age, but both showing signs of the neverending story being etched upon their psyches, with one being rewarded and privileged for being the ex's mini-me and the other punished, harped on constantly, criticized, his self esteem in shreds, I think for calling it as he sees it… I really need to stop expecting different behaviour from this guy, as he's reliably loathsome, hypocritical and supercilious.
Sorry for my digression — I meant to circle back to ask William if he has any co-parenting w a narc tips, aside from parallel parenting…*sigh* …but if these fainting episodes could be signposts for actual changes that I can make, to make better relationship choices, for mental, emotional and physical health, I'm very interested. Hopefully there's a relationship between syncope and the therapy you mentioned.
As it is, at least I have learnt now how to tell these pesky NPD/sociopath types (that I attract and am attracted to) to go away and not come back; they seem to clam up and lose interest when I tell them that I need to put my house in order, to put my kids first, or work on myself, and as much as I want to give them more of my time, or other resources, doing so prevents me from taking care of who or what's important, i.e. not them.
I don't block my ex; I just have his contact set to mute.

I wouldn't be able to do it. Lol I'm Mexican and I just pull my friend aside and mention that I don't eat meat but appreciate the offer. I mention that I'd be happy to eat some sides or anything without pork, chicken or beef. I eat seafood but that's as far as I am able to eat anymore. If I don't eat something I'm not going to make myself sick trying to eat it and true friends would understand that.

This. I went to a Coco's, which had shutdown a few months after we went, and there was a long dark hair in my Alfredo toward the bottom of the bowl. I told the waiter and they called over their manager who said I probably put it in there because it was not hers or the waiters and the cook didn't have long hair. I had red hair at the time. I was already cranky and tired because I had gotten out of work and I also had just thrown up because seeing someone else's hair in the food I just ate half of made me super nauseous. We paid for our meal and were offered a slice of pie before we left because “their kitchen was closed and we can't make anymore food"". I just wanted to leave. I was already fighting off tears and a breakdown from stress at work and the situation. My husband felt so bad. Lol If they had just owned up to their mistake it wouldn't have been as bad but them calling me a liar when I clearly didn't shove a hair into the bottom of the dish on top of puking was the tip of the iceberg that day.

When I was younger, someone called CPS on my mom and she was told by the social workers that my brother and I needed to have separate rooms. We are a year apart and we were about 9 and 10. This was in California in the late 90s to early 2000s. I guess it all depends on the person who actually goes out and is checking on families.

I was debating on doing my own makeup for my wedding but a friend of mine made a great point he said, “you'll have enough to worry about that day let alone trying to get your makeup right yourself. “ My makeup was gifted by my amazing mother in law but it was worth it. I just had to sit there, try to relax from wedding day jitters and not worry about anything like why my wings aren't coming out straight. Lol Someone also did my hair. I know myself and how frustrated I get when I'm trying to do something perfect so it helped a lot.
All the women I've known in my lifetime have gotten their makeup done professionally.

I tip after they come usually in cash because our food has been stolen way too many times. I've had a woman driver answer my call when she completed my order and pretend she couldn't hear me when I was trying to ask where she was because we didn't get our food. I could hear myself echoing on her end over her speaker. She hung up on me and declined my calls after that. It was an expensive order so I guess her greed got the best of her.
If you don't accept my order, that's totally fine but I'm not tipping until after what I paid for gets to my house and in my hands.

I am worried this will be my brother. My brother has crippling anxiety. He is going to be 23 soon, he just quit his job of 6 years because of his anxiety, he has quit school 2 times, and now he’s on academic probation.
It’s been very hard for him, but it has always been really hard for my family, especially for my mother. I hope he can find his way in life because he can’t live with our parents forever.

See my neuroscience program isn’t like that. We never had to memorize pathways (except for Biochemistry class). i had to take a 4 credit neuroscience research methods class where we had preform PCR, western blots, cell splitting, cell staining, mouse brain slicing and staining, microscopy, etc. That class was the hardest class I have ever taken.
My curriculum is also missing coding. Although they introduce R in biology II lab and you practice with excel is statistics. But yeah, that’s It’s not enough.
I think that a lot of people do not know what studying neuroscience is really like because it’s so interdisciplinary. Definitely look deeply into the classes and program before applying.

I think that a lot of people do not know what studying neuroscience really is like because it’s so interdisciplinary. Definitely look deeply into the classes and program before applying.

Hi Kale it’s me. I’m going to be a senior in college soon! Crazy, right?
I was going to apply for a PhD in molecular neuroscience this fall, and well.. I realize that I absolutely hate bench work. I might look into more clinical/psychology side of neuroscience, but as right now I’m not pursuing a PhD nor do I have any desire to go to medical school.
Luckily, my parents are very supportive of this decision. I’m sorry that you’re parents are pushing you to keep pursuing a higher education. You’re so smart and young, Kale. Stick to your gut and have faith in yourself. And you know, I’m seeing some of my classmates go off to graduate school and I’m wondering if they will be fit for it or if they will be happy. The truth is, nobody really knows. I definitely don’t know where the future will take me! Also, you are so much more than your old researcher self. You’re a writer, disability advocate, a friend, a boyfriend, a cat father. Tap into those things. I feel like as STEM majors we are so focused on one identity but the world, and yourself, is so much bigger than that.that. Keep growing, keep trying new things, stick to what you feel is best, and time will help you figure it out.

I’m not trying to minimize your great actions, but I hate when people celebrate a police officers during officer when they do their job. It’s your job to investigate things that are dangerous. This shouldn’t be celebrated, it should be expected. You don’t see doctors on tv when they save people’s lives.

I’ve been following you for 4 or 5 years now, and I think I’ve mentioned before how you’re still one of the Quorans I still read about. I’ve honestly been really curious about what your plans are for after you graduate. I’m studying neuroscience now, I’m in my third year and I can’t believe you went through all that just to change what you want to do. It’s funny how life is and I can’t imagine how difficult that decision was, but I’m so happy that you’re doing something your more passionate about. Whoever you work for, whatever you doing, they are so lucky to have you!
Another funny thing is that I really looked up to you in high school, and I even had a dream that you mentored me. Like you, I think I’m drawn to neuroscience because it found me, and me; it gave me a purpose when I had none. Luckily though, I still enjoy it, and don’t see myself doing anything else. You were always so multifaceted though, and I knew that when you opened up your own business business/website (remember, was wasn’t it like tutoring at Hopkins or something?) and college prep?) Anyways, I’m so excited to follow you on your new journey!

Why does my female friend chat about extremely personal stuff (her breasts and other sexual stuff) despite having a boyfriend and also knowing that I have feelings for her (rejected me directly)?
She is selfish. And, in her way is cashing in on your attention. If you really want to see if she is truly “friend capable” ask her to not talk about things that she knows would trigger any man. anyone attracted to her. If she wants to be friends, respect would “respect”would be to share things you have in common. And if you have that kind of patience, see if she can understand. Its good for you to give her something to think about. Even if she gets defensive. She will think about what you had to say, and change her ways around you, or whatever. not.

What does it mean when someone tells you they love you in a dream?
I had a few dreams about the same guy id been in love with since the day i met him. But after a while one night after we got closer and closer i slept and dreamnt of being beside him in bed(where i was with him 3hrs earlier) and he told me he Loved me. I yearned to hear those words for years. The only dream i ever had with him saying it. I do believe it was a yearn, because id held onto the idea of him opening up to me for years.

I was abused sexually as a child by mother and her drug addict friends. I enjoyed and loved it. My father was mean and would beat me badly so whatever my mother had to give me I wanted it. The bad thing is my mind has ducked things up and now I have a deep hatred not for the ones who turned me out but those who knew and left me in the house they be tortured.

A little backstory about me. I’m a 45 year old man who has never been married. Im terrible with women and dating and relationships have never come easy to me and they never last. I’m always rejected. I am clearly a horrible human being if no woman wants to give me a chance at a relationship. But I’m trying to fix this and have been pouring lots of resources in. I got a big job promotion recently with a big raise and pouring more money and time into self help books and courses, therapy, and hiring a dating coach and a life coach and hiring a spiritual reiki coach and I’m calling the pastoral team to help me fix things just in case it’s simply just God hating me too much to help me get a girlfriend. I’m even pouring in lots of money to update my wardrobe and I’ve bought pheromone scented colognes and soaps and lotions and hygiene products which are supposed to alter my body chemistry to where it sends out chemical signals to nearby women telling them that I’m slightly more attractive than I actually am. I joined weight watchers and I get up at 4am to work out and have lost 60 pounds. I put off taking my own life to give all this a chance. But if it fails in a few years, I truly will know society is better off without me. After all, if no woman can fall in love with me and see me as husband and boyfriend material, then it means I’m a horrible human being with nothing to offer. Just look all the happy couples around and I see all kinds of guys who can walk up a woman and never get rejected. While I’m always rejected. I’ll be talking to my therapist and the pastoral team at my church before ending things. But before I take my life in a few years, how should I get my affairs in order before taking my own life? What advice can you give me?
This is a very heavy post! OK, first off, having a physical ailment doesn't mean that God, or anyone else, hates you; this includes palpitations at bedtime! You are investing in improving yourself thru therapy, self-help, dietary changes, exercise and spirituality. Adressing your health so holistically will improve your mood, appearance and life in general. These are all wonderful things! Make sure that you also do the activities you love. Fall in love with life, first. As for your nightly palpitations, there are many possibilities. You need to work with a general practitioner to determine if there is a physical cause for this malady. Your primary care practitioner (PCP) can help you by ordering initial tests, diagnostics and specialist referrals, like blood work, electrocardiograms and card…

People sometimes make mistakes. Regardless, this was not an “oops, I colored outside the lines” mistake. This was a series of poor choices that lead to you betraying a sacred vow in a heinous way. You need to be honest about your transgression, and take the consequences of your actions. If that means family counseling and doing everything necessary to rebuild trust with the husband you harmed, then you'll be lucky. More than likely, you've caused irreparable damage to your relationship.

I’m glad your nurse focused on the baby, and that you have a daughter who survived so healthily. I don’t believe this god complex is unique to male doctors. Most doctors do want to help as many as possible; unfortunately they become inured to the plight of humanity watching so many deaths and trying to focus on saving as many lives as possible amongst the stupidity and harshness of humankind.

Details: Both myself and my friend grew up very poor and homeless at times. We were incredibly close as teens, but parted ways in high school. She chose drugs and partying, I chose to enter the military and then pursued a career in healthcare. We came together again several years ago and have maintained a less-close relationship as adults.
I have tried to be helpful to her when my own finances allowed. I've supported her at times monetarily, and took her middle child under wing to provide several opportunities. I've never expected much in return, just friendship, and the hope that the little I could give might help her keep a job or build her confidence.
To be met with such an ugly statement hurts. I don't understand why she would gleefully wager on my potential suffering.

Gadget died at age 10 from lymphoma. He was incredibly sweet! Before his diagnosis he was the healthiest, most fit dog I’d ever had in my life, and had a very tolerant demeanor towards kids.
Unfortunately, he was one of a cluster of dogs in our neighborhood to develop lymphoma within months of eachother, something I and my neighbors attributed to years of round-up exposure. Nothing anyone could prove, but something we all suspected. He’s been gone for nearly 7 years, and I miss his antics regularly.

BPD= Borderline Personality Disorder. Though the two are frequently confused, they are distinct mental health diagnoses. One is considered a neurochemical imbalance (bipolar disorders), and the other is a collection of maladaptive personality traits developed as a combination of response to environmental pressures and hereditary baseline.

Depends on your age. As an adult, yeah. As a minor, not really, but it depends.

Would you marry a man that had previous sex with other men but will not admit it to you?
No, because if he can't be open and honest with me, or himself, then he's not ready for commitment.

Is a 4 inch penis in a 47 yr old rare?
Nope, that's average. In my experience, most men have around 4-5 inches.

I know that masturbation is natural and healthy, but I always end up feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself when I do it. What is wrong with me? Should I stop?
Sounds like you're doing it too often, and are not comfortable with yourself, or the act itself. There's nothing wrong with you, and you don't have to stop. Maybe you're going too far with it and need to take a break. It's okay to feel grossed out, just find out what you're comfortable with.

How do you know when it is absolutely necessary to speak up?
It happens often and not only when you were raised in an isolated or sheltered environment. Anyone can be faced with the dilemma of crippling fear when sharing point of views in front of a group or even one on one. Or a person may be habitual to acting on impulse and lashing out without an apparent reason. So, it is important to put into groups, situations, in which you must or mustn’t speak.
You must stay silent when:
a loved one is venting about their problems and may just need a listening ear.
an elder or senior (especially) is trying to convey some ‘golden words’
you are angry and may lash out at the nearest target.
Read here to know when is the appropriate time to speak and when is the time you must keep your cool.

What should I do? I am 34 years old, unemployed, single, I live with my old parents, I have social anxiety, I am afraid to go out. I have no money for medication and for the therapist. My English is not good to work online, no one is helping me.
First of all, Do not put yourself down and Do not compare yourself to others as that would break your confidence. 1. Upgrade your communication skill * Learn English and improve speaking skills as that would give you a competitive advantage and will land you a decent job as that's would make it easier for you to climb the corporate ladder. 2. Be Confident (if not fake it till you make it) * The technique to being confident is to try to recall any of your previous achievements that you have to endeavour, doesn't matter whether it's small or big. You have to be in that moment of achievement that you have achieved. As this would give you the “let's do it” kinda things and by this, you would be able to make the first impression as the best impression. 3. Try to make friends/meet more people * It's hard somet…

It is not the oppressed's responsibility to educate the oppressor. It is inappropriate and triggering to be asked to educate those whom hurt us.
However, I'll give you this: Our disdain for men is not a generalization based on one bad interaction. Our disdain (or more accurately, the need to protect ourselves) arises from years and years of perpetual and pervasive misogyny and interactions with men who feel they can dominate us. The effect is cumulative. You are a member of a population who has done a lot of damage and continues to oppress women. We would rather feel safe and live harmoniously with all of human-kind, but most of us have not had positive experiences with men (often starting with our fathers and brothers) and are now in self-preservation mode. No one is looking out for us. We have to do it for ourselves. Hell, we even have to fight misogyny within our own sex and gender!! Yes, many of us have become hypervigilant, but for numerous valid reasons.
So, rather than asking what is wrong with women/the oppressed, ask what is wrong with men/the oppressor and the society that breeds this corruption. You are not the victim here.

What should I do about my brother refusing to invite me to his wedding because I haven’t gotten the vaccine?
You should either get vaccinated so you can attend, or stay home.
What answer are you looking for here? Permission from strangers on the internet to breach your brothers trust and wishes by attending unvaccinated?

The only thing I would disagree with here is the overgeneralisation that chihuahuas and other small breeds are “never” suitable for families with kids. It’s just not true.

ok so I have been talking to my boyfriend for 5 months and we just started officially dating about two months ago. When we first started talking I was unsure if I wanted to be with him; however we would speak constantly. There were two instances before we started dating where we fought and he insulted me and blamed me for his bad actions. Eventually we began dating and since then he has not done anything bad or been mean to me. The other day I caught him looking through my messages him. I confronted him and he promised to never do that again and said he only did it be he wasn’t my number one best friend on Snapchat. My boyfriend also insists he sees me every single day and texts me all the time. He gets upset when I suggest that I sleep alone. He insists on driving me to class and picking me up (although I do appreciate not having to take the bus). He offers to pay for everything and buy me the world. I’m just not sure if this is normal or cause for worry.

What are the symptoms of anxiety?
When you overthink and it leads to inaction. That’s anxiety in its most basic form. Giving yourself time to think before doing is a good thing. But when overdone then it becomes a counterproductive, unhealthy mental habit that feeds your fears until you realize you don’t want to do it anymore. All of a sudden you’ve created ‘imaginary problems’ in your head which makes it more difficult for you to move forward. “What if they don’t like me? / But I’m so awkward / I might be terrible at it.” The antidote: Conscientiousness. “The mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.” (Robin Sharma) Discipline your mind. Do not let it work on its own. When you are aware of your own thoughts you can learn to stop overthinking at will. Like any mastery, it’ll take deliberate practice, but it is one of t…

So then why do people criticize Jews for being adamant about not allowing Palestinians to have equal voting rights? I'm sure they're afraid what happened to Lebanon will happen in Israel and it will eventually become Arab Muslim majority.
I live as a minority in the US and honestly speaking, I pray it stays secular as a Christian majority country even if I'm a South Asian Hindu minority. I don't want it to be Muslim majority in the very distant future or ever. If that happens, I feel the secular nature of the country will disappear.
I don't see Arab Muslim majority nations accommodating non-Muslim views on secularism or laws of the land. All Muslim majority countries, for the most part, try to be as Islamic as possible, so I wonder why Non-Muslim majority countries are so quick to accommodate sharia law and lose their secular nature.

Do some men hate feminism? If so, why?
The primary reason I know why feminism is hated by anti-feminists is that the anti-feminists feel that feminists are asking for special privileges for women. The special privileges feminists want for women are the rights men have enjoyed for centuries: access to work, property ownership, control of their own bodies, voting rights, wage equality… the list goes on, but it pretty much boils down to equality with men under the law. For anti-feminists, these equal rights are special rights. This is not the case for feminists.

Why do Indians returning from the US start talking with a fake American accent?
Well this is an interesting question. So, I grew up in the United States. My parents brought me over when I was 5, my accent is confused. I can speak Indian languages which I forgot for many years as a child, but I relearned them. I try to speak the language in the authentic, Indian accent. When I speak in English, my accent isn’t Indian because I didn’t grow up in India. I have noticed my cousins when they came to the US, initially used to wear sunglasses inside or act really strangely to show they’re Americanized or cool now. Try to speak English in an American accent which, I mean they still have an Indian accent so it still sounded Indian. Now, they've come down to earth and act normally and don’t try to fake an accent.

How come Indian Supermarkets like Patel Brothers and Apna Bazaar sell beef and other meat products when they have pooja items and murtis sold in there markets? At same point the workers who stock the beef and other meats could also stock pooja items.
Indians or South Asians aren't just Hindu, they come in all different religions and subcultures some of which don’t have any issues with beef and other meats. Sadly, Indians have no knowledge about other religions and subcultures of India.
When it comes to a business, religion and political views don’t decide what is sold or offered by the business. Plus, Patel Brothers doesn’t just cater to Indians, they also cater to Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are majority Muslims.

My very first bf. I was a teenager when we dated, I’m 29 now. He contacted while in town one day and I told him how I was going through a heartbreak. We met up to get my mind off it and talked about the old days. I began feeling sad again explaining my heartbreak.. He told me “Its his loss” ❤️

When I was 18 my ex was 28 the relationship was wonderful at first but I was so young I ended up outgrowing him i him. I broke things off after 1yr. Its not illegal but he's still got alot of growing up to do. If you want to settle down ,get married and have kids in the next 2–3 years he may not be ready for that.

Men have a greater need for sex than women do thats why. It's not our fault It' has always been this way. Men naturally chase women. Women are more picky when it comes to finding a partner.

I've been struggling with a similar issue. I love my fiance so much but im starting to realize I'm more attracted to women.
.I decided to stay with him because I do still love him weve been together for 9 years and I do have an attraction for him still. If you feel like you don't have any strong romantic feelings for him its better that you end it so that you can both find someone you can truly love

What attracts introverted men?
Introverts are attracted by things that do not interfere with their personality in any way. An introvert would be glad to spend time with less talkative person who does not disturb him/her with noise. So, socially introverts prefer nerds as friends. In a relationship, an intro would want to be associated with a person who is secretive, low profile and who likes indoor fun. Although introverts are not anxious in public settings, they have great tendency to make use of their own time without mingling with the external world. Such tendency may create boredom or loneliness and thus an introvert still would be willing to have a gf or bf whom he can spend quality time with.

Where I'm from, neither glass or alcohol are allowed on the beach. I think this “hack” is saying to switch out the Listerine and vodka, and give the vodka good coloring so it looks like Listerine — basically, it’s how to sneak alcohol onto the beach with minimal risk of getting caught.

This was all too interesting not to comment. INFJ here, just to specify. It really sounds like you’re just arguing about the logical fallacies of using specific cognitive functions while de-valuing others. Of course an INTP has a problem with an INFJ using Ni- INTP’s devalue it!
Let me compare this to a mathematics analogy (I’ve got a masters in pure math- and we’re talking about thought algorithms). To me, INTP’s thinking is kind of like a proof using induction, one step building to the next until the conclusion has been reached- like going up the stairs, one step at a time. That’s fantastic- very logical. If you wanted to prove 2 million was even, you could count up by 2’s until you reach it. QED- Fantastic. Or you could notice the pattern (Ni)- that it’s in the form of 2n. Much quicker way to reach a conclusion. In this analogy, the inductive proof (INTP) will most times be correct (yes- you’re human, you make mistakes too), but it takes forever, and they can’t even reach some conclusions. Finding the pattern will usually be correct, but of course the chance for constructing an erroneous pattern is higher. The trade-off being that INFJs can also reach conclusions more quickly, which has value in itself- especially for dealing with people in the present moment or theorizing ideas in general. INTP’s also need enough valid data to even reach their conclusions at all. Here I might compare INFJ’s to using a telescoping type proof to fix that problem. (It’s partially a judger vs perceiver preference difference too).
My long time best friend, whom I adore, is an INTP (female); the person that I spent the most time with this year is an INTP (male). I truly love how consistent you all are. But- your social skills lack! I’ve had to bail you guys out so many times. Inferior Fe, and polar Se- you’ve not got a strong a sense of the social aspects going on around you. You barely (if at all) notice when you are being offensive, so why would you notice when others are? An INFJ can hardly NOT notice it (Ni-Fe).
Plus, just because an INTJ says that they wanted to be mean to the kid because he looked like Joeffrey, doesn’t mean that the INFJ will devise their feelings the same way. It’s Fe-Ti axis vs Te-Fi axis. Decisions just aren’t made the same. You, who is on the same axis as the INFJ for decision making, didn’t mention feeling the desire to be mean to this kid- rather you liked him for what he did (being a hoot- Ti-Fe). This is because Fe-Ti axis makes decisions based on how the person is treating others (Fe) and that is basically aided by whatever subjective logic frame is built up in the person’s mind (Ti). INTJ was probably right about their own vendetta (Fi) showing up in their feelings about the kid. INTJ’s are endearing like that.
Also, the kid really may have been a jerk before that and you simply didn’t notice. Kid’s behaviors do 180’s so much (lots of great neuroplasticity). Also, some kids behave better for men, and some behave better for women. It’s a pattern that I’ve had many of my teacher friends tell me about- and noticed myself too. My money is on her having some information (probably picked up via Fe-Se) that you didn’t about the kid.
In sum, saying that INFJ’s are illogical just because they don’t use the same “Proof type” as you is a bit irresponsible. If I tried to only use inductive proofs, there would be a whole lot of things that I simply couldn’t do. Additionally, INTP’s subconsciously use a lot of Ni too (socionics). So your logic structures are built on your subjective thinking (Ti) and your subjective experiences (Si) with a swift undercurrent of subjective intuition (Ni) to boot. What I’m saying is, your logic is very subjective to your personal experiences- just as INFJ’s gut feelings are subjective to their own experiences. This really seems like the pot calling the kettle black. You really hate people going along with their gut feelings because you devalue Ni.
Every type has its thinking flaws, INTP’s are no different. To say that the “sore thumb” of an INFJ is a thinking flaw is kind of… it’s just your personal preference! Everyone has a thinking flaw! I think that you got the intent of the question incorrect too. Did you answer the question? Yes. Did you just answer it with a complaint that INTP’s have against anyone who doesn’t value Ti above all else? Yes.
On a side note, guess what type of mathematics problems that I had to assist INTP’s with? Ones involving patterns (Ni)! =)
Feel free to counter any of this. I wouldn’t mind clarifying certain points. I realize that I can sometimes jump from A to C, but skip mentioning B.

Why would someone who cheated on you, and after you left them, they found new awesome partner very soon (and they kinda liked comparing this new partner to you), contacts you occasionally even after a year, while still having this new relationship?
He's a narcissist, wants to keep you on a string so you'll be available if and when the new girl figures out he is evil. He feeds off your attention and the comparisons between you are a classic behavior. :(

Every pet I've ever had has slept in my bed, usually under the covers. Some of them even like to lay their heads on the pillow. Currently we have 3 small dogs and they are no exception. Nugget likes to burrow under they covers and snuggle alongside my back or belly. Millie likes to stay on top of the covers at the foot of the bed or up on a pillow between my husband and myself. Beau, the baby, sprawls on top of one or the other of our chests or heads even.. They keep us warm and derive comfort and security from being close to us. I would never have it any other way.

❤️ hang in …just keep holding on, hold on through the pain, even when it feels like it will never end, because it is a cycle, exactly as you said. I sometimes forget that myself. That's why it's so important to reach out to others wunderstand, like you are here. Because this life of manic highs and lows can at times cause us such deep anguish that we just want to get off the roller coaster. But, remember, it's all a wild ride and we are just a turn or a hill away from the next ecstatic joy. Even if it's brief moments, you will feel joy. Pain, after breaking us down, builds us up. It's just more dramatic for those of us who suffer depression. I'm holding on with you. ❤️❤️❤️

When Frontline plus stopped working for our dogs (after 15 years of excellent flea and tick control) we tried 4 other top spot treatments and ended up finding the most cost effective and almost total eradication of fleas with seresto collars. Purchased directly from authorized dealers only. There are a LOT of counterfeits out there and they can be dangerous.

What are some tips for keeping a journal of your therapy sessions?
That’s a great question and one that is such an individual process so take what I offer with a grain of salt. One thing to consider before taking notes may be asking yourself “what makes me want to journal in the first place?” So that you can get an idea of what structure and ideas you may have about the direction of journalling you’re headed in. For example, have you agreed with your therapist some exercise aims that might take a more structured, day-by-day journal shape, or if you are working more fluidly and often tap into the depths of your imagination, perhaps you’d try using a big blank journal where you can scribble notes and layer magazine images or colour drawings. If you’ve got an idea of what type of journal you’re drawn to, another question would be “what is holding or what would…

Why would someone stop therapy suddenly in the middle of their sessions without telling their therapist?
This strikes me as a question about what is unsaid between therapist and client. I’m imagining a client who regularly attends therapy and perhaps all’s going well on paper but one day towards the middle of their contracted relationship, they leave all of a sudden, no email, no voice message, nothing. Getting the obvious out of the way first; clients can face uncontrollable financial difficulties, physical or geographic circumstances etc. but I get the sense you’re wondering about what may cause a client to intentionally leave therapy. In that respect I’m drawn to the idea of rupture and repair in that particular therapy relationship. For example: * C: “A is bothering me because I feel B” * T: “Ok so A is bothering you because of X” * C: “No no… X has nothing to do with it, I feel B.” * T: “Well B might j…

Hi, thanks for the great post! It was incredible informative :) Just wondering, what city did you end up moving to in the UK?
My partner and I are actually living in London but looking to move due to the high crime rates here (and looking for more accessibility to greenery), so are weighing options to move to somewhere else in the the UK such as Edinburgh or Bristol with its supposed better quality of life.

For me, it's not emotional expression in itself that is off-putting. I agree that in a film, performance, piece of music, an authentic moment between friends or spouses, emotion can be deeply moving and even an INTP can get misty eyed, and have genuine empathy.
When people become irrationally or plain unhinged emotional, that's when I disconnect and want to run away and disengage. There's something about immature emotional expression like whining, dramatic flair for attention that comes off manipulative and disingenuous that is also really off-putting.
It's not that we run from emotions, or never feel any. I know I feel very intense/deeply but I'm definitely guarded with it. Showing emotion denotes vulnerability and I also get easily flustered when emotion is high. I don't like feeling out of control.

I enjoy these writing moments. You're hardly feeling as if you're “working” when you're in the flow and the characters have essentially hijacked you as their conduit to get themselves onto the page. Part of the occasional magic, in my humble opinion.

I believe that many of the comments here are very helpful. Probably much more so than what I'm about to say.
As a woman (and a writer of fiction, including some spicy works) I would only like to offer up this, perhaps it might be helpful: If you're writing from a female POV or just wanting to understand more about female perception, women are very sensitive to scent. In my own writing work, I personally draw a lot on the sense of smell and describe these things, also the tactile and even the sound/timbre/volume of a voice. They are aspects of “sexual attraction” that can be quite powerful. Though, I am a very sense oriented person in general. I can only write/speak from my experience.
Hope it can be a little useful, however, the other comments suggesting having a trusty female to assist, or a writer's circle is excellent.

What are the ghouls in Fallout?
They are human beings who were affected by high levels of radiation that mutated them into the crispy, husky-voiced characters we find in the game such as Hancock, Jason Bright, Bobbi No-Nose, Dean Domino and others. They achieve an almost immortality as ghouls exist from the Pre War Era and you will meet them in the various games. Their aging process is slowed significantly from the radiation mutations that occur. Ghouls typically kept settlements of their own and lived among one another in societies (Necropolis, Underworld) because all ghouls will eventually become feral but the rate at which that transformation occurs varies from Ghoul to Ghoul. Because of this eventuality, Ghouls will live among ferals and attempt to keep them from the rest of the wasteland population. Ghouls retain the…

What did Kellogg mean in Fallout 4 when he said ""I'm just a puppet like you""?
My personal interpretation is probably the most obvious; You’re both being manipulated by The Institute. He knows the truth about Shaun but at that point in the game, you do not. He was used by The Institute for at least, approx. 100 years and you were lead to him. It can be read as a warning.
Or, you can interpret it as a hint to the “Sole Survivor is a Synth” theory.
You be the judge.

Do you believe all addictions have the same root cause?
The short answer is No. I have met opiate addicts who had lived relatively “normal"", stable, well adjusted lives and due to some unforeseen incident such as a car accident, cancer diagnosis, physical injury, etc. were prescribed narcotics and after a time of taking them found themselves addicted. There IS a distinction between physical dependence and addiction however. But there can also be a crossover where one might have begun as physically dependent and then began acting out addiction behavior such as theft, secrecy, lying about intake, doing anything to access that substance, etc. . Then you have addicts who experienced abuse, trauma, chronic shame/neglect or were people who were by temperament or personality more curious and risk-taking or had impulse control issues and gravitated towar…

Kathryn Browning
If God loves us, why doesn’t he give us what we want?
This answer may seem a bit simplistic and vague, even but I always understood it this way: God expects us to depend and rely on him with love and trust that his Will for us is greater than we can understand in the moment. He does not hand out wishes, like a magic genie in a bottle or a fairy godmother. He wants us to learn, grow and seek him in all we do. That requires faith. Faith in God means surrendering our will for his. Whatever that may be, whether we understand or no.

Without context it is a little hard to advise. Are your errors with social interactions, is it work tasks or is it family? Do you have addictions or a medical condition that makes focusing difficult? Age is the normal way with dealing with things if you can learn from your mistakes.
Thank you very much for the reply. Sorry english isn’t my first language but I am trying my best to clarify. The errors that I made are usually in social interactions and doing simple activities.
In social interactions, I sometimes fail to understand a simple command. And overcomplicate a simple instruction. I am trying to think in a simple way but still it is so hard. Like when my dad asked me to do A+B, but I do A+F+I+Z instead..
When I solve math problems, I overcomplicate an easy math problem. Strangely, I solve the hard problem faster than the easy one. That is so ironic
And I also make other dumb mistakes like: dropping a tray, picking up wrong trolley in supermarket, drinking wrong coffee in Starbucks. I know it is embarassing. But when I made such mistakes, i felt as if my MIND was not connected to the REALITY. As a result, no matter how much I tried to focus and anticipated any possible mistake, I still ended up making the mistakes.

1984 is one of my favorite books ever. The best part in this book I think is the part from “The Book” which describes the politics behind the eternal wars and the society manipulation. It's easier to control people when they're ignorant and living in constant fear.
Also the speech of O'Brien is so important: Power is not a tool for making justice and progress like many people think. Power is a goal and one doesn't get power to give it away.
Finally, Orwell insisted on the importance of language. You cannot think straight with poor linguistic knowledge. You cannot talk about “Freedom” if there's no word as “Freedom” in the dictionary.
I guess there's more to learn from 1984 than what I've mentioned above.

Do you always unconsciously sit on the edge of the chair because your legs can’t fully rest on the floor?
As someone who is barely 5 foot (that is 150 cm for you intelligent people), I can surely say that I always sit on the edge of the chair when my legs can’t rest on the floor
Some exceptions is when there are ledge on the chair or table (I don’t know if this is the correct term, I mean the bar between chair or table legs to rest your feet upon), only then can I sit comfortably.

Can being a people pleaser make you a toxic person?
Definitely.
Imagine a people pleaser stuck in between two opposing sides. She will try her best to be diplomatic, avoid confrontation, and please both sides. When that is not possible, she will eventually resort to deception, or other negative things just to avoid being disliked by either side. If deception is not toxic then I don’t know what is.

Not every culture makes out death as the horrific tragedy. Some even celebrated it, which quite make sense since death is natural and will happen to everyone. For the Torajans in Indonesia,

What is the biggest misnomer of historical figures?
In Indonesian history, there are many famous historical figures, here are some of them:
Gajah Mada, directly translated, “Gajah” means “Elephant” in Indonesia. And no, our famous hero is not an Elephant.
Hayam Wuruk, which literally translates to “An Educated Chicken” (no, I am serious). Again, he is not a chicken, though I assume he must be well educated as a King.
Orang Kayo Hitam, he is just my favorite hero, how could you not love a “Rich Black Man”. This is not racist, this is just Indonesian history.
There are others, but these are some of my favorite historical figures misnomers which have puzzled me since elementary school. I don’t know about the biggest though.

How do you wish good morning to your lover?
I am Asian, so we don’t. Not really. What is even the point of saying good morning, to someone you love or not? More importantly, are there even such things as good mornings? If you are like me, you start your morning dreading your work and job for the day. Doesn’t matter that my house is filled with people I love, there is no such thing as a “good morning”. On that note, to answer your question, really a grunt or simple “hey” is enough to start the day, anything more will take too much of my energy.
People you love will love you anyway!

What is the first thing you will notice once you cut toxic people out of your life?
I felt like that weird, friendless, lonely kid. Because from my experience, those toxic people are everywhere and everyone. They can be the popular crowd or the not-so-popular crowd. I used to think only popular kids are mean, they talk about people behind their backs and made fun of them. But I have known some ugly and not popular people be as toxic as those popular kids, because they want to drag others down and make themselves look better. Those cliches about how the pretty women are dumb and the nerds are super kind? NOT TRUE AT ALL. If you cut toxic people out of your life, you will find that there is nowhere that you really belong, because everyone is at least a little bit toxic, even you yourself.

Why do some people have wanderlust and not others?
I suppose different kind of people will have different reasons for having wanderlust. For me personally, my wanderlust is a result from my urge to run away from my current situation. I feel as though currently all my family and friends and colleagues and the strangers have all become too familiar and too much. By being too familiar, I no longer feel excited about what is to come. I know who I will meet tomorrow or the next day, so what am I supposed to be excited about? Not to mention I kept being reminded of all the past mistakes that I made everyday due to the familiar surrounding. So yeah, I would like nothing more than to just pack my bags and go somewhere foreign and be anonymous. Some reasons why some people doesn’t have wanderlust might be because they are perfectly content with wher…

İn my opinion ,most folks live through survivalist point of view ,be it whether knowingly or unknowingly ,but for some minority ,they don't tolerate when the prospects of life getting lower and lower ,and at certain degree ,they can face every danger ,suicide to not fall below that point ,this way could lead them either termination of themselves or getting imprisoned ,tortured ,and this might be a cause or personal aim .

İt pains me to my core to see this post about Armenians ,why do you not mention the things system of a down did to our nation ,do you know the name of serj's child ,you get to nowhere by heavily and constantly humiliating us ,as is the seculars by humiliating Islamic religion ,Do you know the statue depicting Talat Pasha under the feet of his murderer ,that is found in Armenia ,what you constantly do is to cry ,being a cry baby ,and needs others to constantly feed you milk ,but alas you don't ever stop crying ,beware of Turks rage ,because when you continue fucking complaining all the time with everything ,Turks always pay the price .

At the least ,i could say personally that don't do drugs ,avoid medication ,maybe you need to question your being .being, i tell you this as a one medicated for so long ,(long enough to cover two decades) ,so what I advised is more precious than doctor's medication,in my thinking psychiatry is probably pseudoscience ,and when I delve into depths of reasoning ,i could easily say the so-called “doctors” are only the gatekeepers of capitalism ,at the end if you dare to question so-called “human civilization” ,you could see that all had been ,was ,is a “SCAM”.

I'm on the verge of taking my life. How can I say goodbye without hurting anyone?
Guys, life isn't for everyone. I've suffered for 3 years and now it's becoming unbearable. Why me ? I didn't choose to be like this. Telling me it'll be better won't help. You don't understand until you've gone through it. I'm tired of the sleepless nights and of the overwhelming thoughts. I just want to say goodbye without people feeling guilty and with questions unanswered. I don't want them to feel as bad as I do. Why me ? Why ? I just wish that you guys don't ever feel like this. There's so much for you to go forward. God bless you all.

How do you say ""relentless"" in Arabic?
I would say that it depends heavily on the context. The Online Cambridge Dictionary mentions the word قاس (Qaas)
In another place دَؤوب (daʼūb) is mentioned to signify never ending!

Yes, especially if he worked hard! I wish the grades we get in touch could reflect the level of success we get later in life but they really don’t. Perhaps his area of interests lie somewhere else. Just encourage him to keep trying hard and tell him that hard work is the only thing that truly matters.

It’s late night entertainment. It’s opinion…for the sake of entertainment. Does professionalism really apply?

Why does no one admire rigid parents?
Why doesn’t anyone want every single aspect of their lives during their childhood controlled and manipulated, leaving them an anxious mess for the rest of their lives?
Hmmm

Do you think a cockapoo is the best companion dog for people over 40 years of age?
Why the fixation on breed?
Consider adopting a dog, and focus on the temperament, not the breed. :)

Why are some people ashamed of their parents?
This answer is going to be a bit disjointed/emotional/to the point. I’m turning 30 this year. I was raised by my grandparents since the age of seven. I don’t call my mother mom, I refer to her by her name, because she was not my mother, my grandmother took on that role. I just got married last year and she wasn’t invited. I don’t regret this decision. I had to tell my family members to hide the fact that I’m getting married (which wasn’t too difficult, I’m the only child and there were only three family members of mine attending the wedding). Reasons behind this decision: I’m not comfortable around her, I have no relationship with her, she can’t control herself around alcohol and would surely make a fool of herself and ruin my wedding, she’s bizarre and childish, unable to hold an adult con…

thanks for your feedback! I actually wanted to point this out. I've had friends that said they recovered from a mental illness, but trying to remember what it was like before they felt better as they do right now seems blurry or foggy to them. I don't really ask a lot about it because I don't want to bother them, and maybe this could happen or could be seen as a coping mechanism like you said. In my case, I was diagnosed with depression and OCD two years ago, but I also can't recall what I've felt. When I talk with my mom about it and she asks me what was like having OCD and depression…I just don't know what to say, I get lost in my thoughts. I'm currently feeling better but sometimes I still feel like I used to before, OCD it's hard to control but I try. (btw, sorry I'm not a native English speaker:( my grammar can be a bit off) but thank you once again! :3

I have come to this conclusion as well. As far as not being into a relationship. I end up really hurting the people that I love or I end up hurting so bad that I can’t function. I believe that being alone is best for me. Not feeling alone, living in a happy solitude. Lol

I’m 52 and recently separated from a 27 year marriage. I had never lived alone. I moved into my own apartment. While I missed my home for a couple of months, I now come to my apartment and smile. I can not imagine sharing my space with anyone ever again. All that you say is true. Especially having the bed to yourself. Lol. Maybe someday I will look for another person to share my life with but right now it’s a big nope.

I have a 20 year old Asd son. He practically lives in his bedroom. He goes to work, comes home, goes to his bedroom. We have to pull conversation from him. I saw that you said that this type of behavior makes you happy. I struggle with accepting that my son is happy. He seems happy enough but I still worry. Please tell me, are you really truly happy with being alone and going to work? I just want my son to be happy and if this makes him happy, I’ll stop trying to force interaction with him or between him and others. Thank you.

This hits home for me. I’ve been estranged from my father for five years. He’s and alcoholic and uses crack. He has a violent temper and assaults people around him. I chose to cut ties with him. One day I had the oddest feelings. It took me about two weeks to realize that I was missing him. The way he used to be. The way he will never be again. When he used to sing to me and play jokes and laugh. He is still alive but he is so unsafe for my family and myself to be around. I dread the day he passes away because I know there will be guilt. Also some people give me a hard time and judge me for not taking care of him. He is homeless. Anyway thank you for writing this.

I dated a guy that would act out his dreams. Slap at the air, get up and throw furniture around, cuss himself out in the mirror. If I got his attention he would yell in my direction but look right through me. It was terrifying.

I absolutely know I'm depressed, but I don't want to get ""undepressed"" again. I don't get a sense in life, but also don't know why I should end it. Can I do anything about it?
I think it's called hopelessness. You don't really want to die but you can't think of a good reason to live either.

What are your top five suggestions for getting out of depression?
Get up . Get out of the house. Walk around the block. Sit at a coffe shop, be around people. Getting up and out is the hardest part but it helps so much.

What song has the lyrics, 'If I'm a danger to myself, just think what I could do to you'?

I don't know if I'm real; I don't know who I am. I can't feel anything. Is this world really real?
I am sorry about a few of the answers. ——————————— What you are feeling is completely normal. It is a side effect of anxiety. I know, the word anxiety is scary- but there is no need to fear. There is a word for what you are feeling. It is called depersonalisation or derealisation. They are words that describe a feeling of a more dreamlike world, one that is out of your hands. It may feel as if you are observing someone else’s actions that are not your own. Here is a link that will help you understand anxiety and depersonalisation more. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder There is a cure for this. It is called cognitive behavioral therapy.

Definitely show them the facial expressions of your suffering. It also helps if you're very interactive and affectionate (to their desired level, of course 😂). I have a beautiful 6 and a half month old male ginger tabby, and he's so beautifully sensitive and affectionate to my needs, very much a reciprocation of how I am and have been to him since I got him at 5 weeks - he even “protects” me when my partner is away 😭 he's my lil ginger angel-muffin😍❤️ best wishes to you with yours 🙏💗

I can see how you got there, but I think it's more of a “show me what you'd body likes and responds to so I can please you better”
Obviously some things will be the same as exes past but that's not to say that this husband will become kme like them to her or in her eyes, you know? Sex is a lot of repetition of the same kinda of actions if you think about it. Its the personal association I guess that would make it “like her exes”. I personally would argue maybe there's something deeper if the wife feels the need to express herself like so to her husband. To quote other lovers as better - what reason does that serve, I cannot imagine a world where that would be used to positively influence change in your partner though.

I strongly suggest a new therapist or breaking off the relationship — efforts to fix it yourselves haven't worked and professional help isn't working. Either your therapist is incompetent or trying to suck money out of you cause surely they'd be able to see a mile away if people aren't compatible and the like and it's their job to tell said people.

I think you are so amazing and empowering to both NT and autistics. Have you ever thought about going into counseling or starting some sort of advice/support program? Your level of introspection is comforting. I am the mom to an amazing son, who has so many amazing qualities. He is high functioning on the ASD. Unfortunately, he doesnt seem to see all the wonderfulness that I do. I can only imagine how hard this must be. I Very much try to let him be him, engage in his intrests, and support him. We are very close. He can have huge meltdowns and doesnt see the value in school. Hes a senior and it is everything I can do to get him through. This is the area we clash.
If you were to give advice to parents on how to best support their high functioning autistic child, what would you say?

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. You don't know how valuable they are to parents of children who are on the spectrum. My son is high functioning and Is so creative, out of the Box smart, hysterically funny And such a gift to this world. He doesnt see that or wont accept that. How do I help him to see these talents? I can tell him, but I'm just mom. I want him to believe in himself more. Do you have any suggestions on how to build that selfesteem. My heart hurts for him because I know hes going through so many extra issues that are not typical. Regulating his emotions and the way he reacts to things are very extreme and I know he knows that. Social skills and anxiety play a huge role. He can tell you how to handle situations but when they actually occur it leaves his brain. He has a therapist and an autisim itinerant. Is there anything that really helped you? You are so very articulate and really seem to understand your emotions. To me that seems like half the battle, trying to get him to explain why hes upset And how to take a pause when he is upset.Any advice would be great because the way you just explained things was so spot on. How do we let our children know just how wonderful they are and it's actually the rest the world thats not as fortunate as them. I am constantly reading to him about famous people in the world that have made Life changing inventions or ideas. Most of those people are on the autism spectrum. We need people on the autism spectrum to enhance our lives.!

I'm on the fence here. My mother didn't spend shit on us, do much for us, and mentally fucked us up. Lucky if we got government powdered milk and cornflakes. Stole tampons and clothes, etc for myself among other things. Yes she barely kept a roof over our heads but I can't recall if that was the whole time we were mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually(men in her life) abused. She deserves nothing if she ever found out my drug addicted sperm donors name and managed to get back pay..fuck that

Today, started out to be a completely normal day, except for the news which turned it into not so normal.
My husband stays awake all night because he is a PHD student and its very difficult for him to continue his work from home while the baby is awake.I mean, he still works during the day, but the efficency reduces greatly with the baby jumping and running all over the place, especially when he spot a laptop on his father’s lap and shout with all his might, OOOOON.
So today, after feeding my baby, I prepared his breakfast with smile plastered on my face. Its kind of my habbit since our marriage, I always prepare breakfast, before waking him up and he always thank for everying on the plate, even though the paratha(bread) doesn't even look like paratha. He said the same thing he has said zillion of times before.
Jaan, ap ny tou kamal kr dia. Ap bht achi hen.
Life or soul(referring to me), you have done wonders, you are so good.
And then he showed me an email from his professor which left me shocked or worried. He was moving somewhere else and can no longer support his new phd students anymore. He apologized and told my husband to keep it confidential from uni and to look somewhere else for phd.
I mean he left his job to pursue his dream of phd in ireland. Leaving me and my 8month old in home country. We were in the middle of applying our vissa. He left in sept 2019 and visited us in feb 2020 because he was missing our son so bad that he decided to take a flight to home country for just 3 days before the conference . Conference got cancelled because of covid-19 and he got stuck here because of lockdown. After lockdown he couldn't go because uni( trinity college dublin) in ireland was close and there was no point in going back there, as everything is shifted to an online system.
Back to square 1. Its 3:16am and he is sitting right beside me searching for new phd positions and i just can't seem to thank lord for blessing me with such an amazing man, who didn't complain neither to me nor to his professor. He congratulated his professor for his new position and told me for hundredth time
“hey, don't worry love. I will get a new scholarship within next 6 months, till then we have enough savings. Maybe it was for better, because this time you guys will go with me. I can't live a day without you and this little monster”.
I’m happy because I’m blessed beyond measure. I’m sad because i can't help him in this situation. I’m scared of, what if……I’m worried for the man who is standing strong for my sake but I’m in love with his calmness, politeness and belief that he will always be able to provide the best for his family.

Who told you that?. Get your facts straight. No muslim on the face of earth drink any form of animal waste, including this nonsense.
The best thing about islam is its clarity.
We are not allowed to drink wine because we have to pray 5 times a day( from the sunrise till the sunset). Wine is bound to make people lose control and no one can pray while they are drunk, hence bound to make mistakes during salah.

I was glad to see seizures mentioned as well; my flight or fight is so constantly in flight mode (I didn’t know this), any trigger can cause me to dead drop (faint, but not from lack of oxygen; just a straight drop to the floor), or worse, have a “seizure”.
My seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or PNES, look and feel like an epileptic grand mal/tonic-clonic, and a video EEG confirmed they’re not epileptic back in ‘17.
Glad to read about this.

I’ve been saying the same thing since 1994. I was a freshman in college, and will never forget that day. I have never believed it was a suicide; most people I knew who followed the band tended to agree. What I find most sad is that his death is remembered before his life. You hear ‘Kurt Cobain’, and most people think of his suicide before they remember what an amazing talent he was, how he shared his soul with his audience every night, how his lyrics could change a mood, a though, a life.
I never saw that note, thanks for sharing.

My daughter is 9, and has severe myopia for her age. She is -3.0 in her R and -4.25 in her L. We put her in contacts over the summer for convenience and to eliminate goggles for sports, and her only complaint is the occasional dry eye. Contacts may help slow myopic decline in certain pediatric patients, and her ophthalmologist was completely on board.
I should note that I am severely myopic, with astigmatisms in both eyes; I’m -9.0 in the R, -10.25 in my left, and have been in contacts since 4th grade (I’m 45). Admittedly, there have been times when we just can’t dial in a diopter/axis/base for my left eye, as it has changed over the years, and I’ve changed my desired outcome. I no longer strive for 20/20; I’m 40/60 at best, with my right eye being corrected for vision alone, while my left eye has always focused on the astigmatism first, then strength.
I have never felt disappointed, devastated, or upset about my vision…maybe a little envy when friends would get LASIK surgery and have perfect vision by the time they get home! (I’m not a candidate because I lack the corneal surface in both eyes, and refractive surgery is out of my budget and my comfort zone.)
Set an example for your child and embrace the uniqueness of wearing glasses. Don’t be their first “four-eyes” bully, please.

Um…I’d remove that .onion link, like, now. Most people reading this are not accessing Quora through Tor, and here on the clearnet, your referral code isn’t anonymous.
There’s a reason this information isn’t found in an A2A on Quora. Same reason why .onion links aren’t indexed by Google…OPSEC. And yours, my friend, needs to be revised.
OP, if you know what to search for, try Reddit. And if you’re using a browser that isn’t Tor, please anonymize yourself behind a VPN until you do. Just a little friendly advice.

Neither. “Finding those papers made her day” is correct for present tense; in this example, “have/has” is unnecessary, as “made” is your verb, used with an object (day).

If you do the exact opposite of what I did (change majors, skip classes, discover Everclear), then it’s not going to be easy.
Tackle college the right way, and you’ll do great. Or you’ll discover a different career path, and then do great then. Enjoy - BoilerUP!

Is there any case of dissociative identity disorder that you cannot remember the timeline of your childhood memory?
The abuse for me started when I was 2 and continued until I was 12. I don't remember much of my childhood at all. I'd say I remember maybe 25%. What I do remember are more like photographs in my head and not actual things I did. Just a picture or some vague smell that will trigger an image. Aside from that I don't remember any conversations except a few. My memories don't actually start until about 12 years old. But I do still have memory gaps when certain traumatic events have happened since then.

My first wish is that myself and everyone else in the world never has to deal with crippling mental health issues. Depression, ptsd, panic attacks, personality disorders, etc would all be knocked out without taking addictive medications.
My second wish would be to have my mom back so I could just talk to her, feel her hand holding mine, hear her voice, see her face one last time and be by her side as she passed. I didn't get to do that and it haunts me.

What has been your most memorable moment in the hospital?
When my second child was born there was a complication during her birth where she became stuck behind my pelvis. The nurse I had was an absolute dream before the pushing stage and afterwards. This nurse showed me and my family such compassion and love. I'll never forget her. I started my time with her after shift change. She was in her mid 40s and genuinely loved her job. At first her bubbly personality annoyed me while I was in pain, but I was never rude to her. She was too kind to be rude to! She stuck with me so much, always checking on me, providing me with as much assistance as I needed and she was just perfect. After the difficult delivery of my baby she came in to check on me shortly after. She stayed by my bed staring at my daughter and saying how proud she was of me for how I handle…

Perineum massage beginning 4 weeks prior to your due date can help.
Having your ob apply gentle pressure while pushing, having your OB use their fingers to gently stretch your vaginal opening while pushing.
Not pushing as hard and forcefully as possible. This allows for baby to stretch you down there instead of being shoved out.

What shocked you the most when giving birth?
A couple of things surprised me a bit.
First thing was that after your water breaks you continue to have gushes with each contraction. Nobody told me this and so I was pretty shocked when it happened with my first lol.
Second surprising thing to me was that I couldnt stop shaking after I received the epidural. I wasnt even abnormally cold, but I just couldnt control the shakes. Totally normal to experience that, but I didnt know to expect it.

Is it normal for a woman giving birth to ""tear"" down there?
I've had two babies and tore with both.
First baby was 6lbs 13oz and I needed 6 stitches.
Second baby was 9lbs 7oz and I had a 3rd degree tear that required internal and external stitches.
It's common for women to tear, but not every woman does. It depends on many factors and there are things you can do to minimize the chances of tearing.

Is pregnancy really that awful? Or is it just that one thing everyone lies about? As an anxious person, I am not sure pregnancy is the right thing for my future.
Everyone has different experiences with pregnancy and giving birth. It can be awful for some but for others it can be great. I feel like most women are honest about their experiences with pregnancy but you should keep in mind that it's so personal and doesnt mean your pregnancy would turn out the same way. My first pregnancy wasnt bad. It was pretty easy and I just dealt with the normal things like morning sickness and the uncomfortable parts like trying to figure out a comfortable sleeping position. My second pregnancy began pretty easily. I did have morning sickness for the first 4 months but after the baby began really growing I felt extremely uncomfortable. She was a large baby and took up lots of space in my stomach so naturally breathing and finding a comfortable position became tough. I…

What is something you wish people knew about pregnancy?
I wish that more people understood the discomforts of pregnancy. When a pregnant woman doesnt feel like going out, cleaning the entire house, cooking elaborate meals or what have you..it doesnt mean shes lazy.
Pregnancy comes easy for some but for others it's more difficult. My pregnancies have been difficult despite having no complications. Sometimes walking from one room to the next puts a lot of strain on my body. On top of that we go through things like months of insomnia, months of nausea and vomiting, not being able to breathe properly during the 3rd trimester and just feeling not quite like ourselves.

Has anyone had a bad experience with a therapist?
When I was 15 I was in therapy due to my issues with depression, self harm, and past trauma from sexual abuse. One of my biggest issues was my mother, which tied into all of the issues above. My mother suspected the abuse that I ensured from ages 2 till 12 and did nothing. She took me to therapy twice at 12 years old and took me out because she said I wasn't cooperating with the therapist. I was severely depressed and began self harming at 14. She only put me in therapy because my high school said in order for me to remain a student I had to see someone. Ok, so at 15 I was talking to my therapist about issues. My mother saw her alone before me for a couple minutes to explain to her that i was being difficult. When I opened up to my therapist she then told me my issues weren't my mom, but tha…

Thank you for saying this. I see so many people throwing around the word depression like it's nothing. Depression isnt just a bad day every once in a while.

Can panic attacks last for days? I have been having similar symptoms for four days and I went to the doctor and they said it was a panic attack but I have never heard of one lasting this long. It feels like my lungs aren’t inflating fully.
Short answer: yes, kind of.
More detailed answer: this happened to me after the birth of my second child. I was exhausted from lack of sleep and a hard labor. I had been home for a few weeks and was still recovering. I have panic disorder but hadn't had a panic attack since she was born. It hit me out of nowhere. Heart racing, cant catch my breath, face feeling numb, I'm dizzy, etc. I freak out thinking maybe I took too much medication by accident. I call my husband and enlist the help of my neighbor and am told to call 911. They come and check me and tell me its a panic attack. Ok, fine. Thinking it was just a huge one I try to rest. The symptoms of that attack lasted 3 days after that. It's not so much the panic attack, but the leftover symptoms and fear of it happening again.

Has a medical professional ever refused to treat you? What reason did they give?
My psychiatrist fired me for suicidal thoughts a few months ago. She claimed I was disrespectful to office staff, I wasnt.
She then said I needed more help than she could provide. I thought psychiatrists were supposed to treat things like that, guess I was wrong lol.

Do you lose your appetite while in labor?
I did birth the births of both of my babies. There is so much going on and pains from contractions that you simply just arent hungry.
I was in labor for 32 hrs with my first. Went about 48 hours without food. I wasnt hungry at the time, but I was starving after!
With my second I was in labor from about midnight and she was born at 530pm. It wasnt bad, but after her difficult delivery I was starving.

Why do some people put a kiss (x) at the end of everything they post or send? Does it make you uncomfortable?
Maybe they’re the kind of person who’s just so expressive and loving? They probably think it’s harmless and is a positive feeling to spread around.
If you feel uncomfortable about it, just be honest about it then. Everyone see and feel things differently. Work something out and you might be able to get a mutual agreement or balance point on this issue.
I personally don’t feel uncomfortable as I know some people use different emojis to express their meanings. However, do know how to differentiate when someone is being… sexual tho. :o You might want to avoid those haha.

I don’t really understand why a guy is starving hungry and eat a lot during the date is a problem haha. As long as the way he eat food is clean and polite, I don’t think it’s a problem. Unless he gives more focus to the food rather than talking to me haha.

Is having sympathy a sign of being weak and unmanly for a male?
No! People needs to stop genderizing emotions.
Male or Female, both are humans. Both can feel happiness, sadness, and pain. It doesn’t make you unmanly for feeling emotions; it makes you a HUMAN.
Stop reacting to people who tells you what a gender should act as. Instead, be what you want to be. Prioritize your own happiness and well being. We wouldn’t want to live our limited life just to get controlled and judge by others, would we?
Life is short, love yourself. No one can treat you better than yourself!

How much should a guy eat if he's going out with a girl for the first time to avoid looking like a pig?
Why fake your food intake in the beginning if she’ll know it after being with you for sometime later?
I don’t think the amount of food intake should be a problem. Just be yourself.
Oh, and make sure you eat politely and clean. Table manners should still be taken care of. Good-luck!

What are some wrong ways to approach a potential love interest?
Being too desperate (you’ll scare them off before you even got the chance to know what is their favourite colour)
Being too conservative (you’re not giving a chance for the both of you to have something to connect to)
Just be yourself. If it’s the right one, it’ll find its way to you.

Why do people get so upset at goodbyes?
Because they cared about the people who are leaving. And they care a lot.
Also, you’ll never know if that goodbye is the last one. Life is unpredictable, and humans are so fragile.
Just appreciate whoever in your life that cares for you.

If you were/are aware you’re hurting a person’s feelings, does an apology even cross your mind?
Everyone have a different level of EQ and mindset. You are going to get a lot of different answer for this question.
For me, I am most definitely going to apologise immediately. I’m one who couldn’t stand the fact that someone is hurting because of me. The guilt bag would be around me for a long time.
However, my partner is totally the opposite of me. If he thinks that the thing he said or action he did is right, he will not feel sorry; not even feeling apologetic.
Whether you hurt someone or you are the one who got hurt, you should be frank to your partner that you feel hurt or you should accept the fact that you hurt your partner. And from there, communicate and fix things. We all make mistakes here and there and fix them to get to somewhere. All the best.

What are the best student organizations or clubs to join at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman? Why should students join them?
The best club is the one you have passion for. There are a lot of Clubs and Society (C&S) in UTAR, but not all are that active. It’s obvious that the C&S that are active are filled with passion driven students. Their activities and events are heated and known to a lot of students. Regardless of which C&S students choose to join, in general, it’s a great platform to know more people outside of their own circle, extending their social network, meeting and exchanging different knowledges and experience with people. I personally would suggest students to try joining the Orientation Programme (in SL Campus) whether as a new student, or an existing student to act as a facilitator for the new student. It’s a great place to start. Consider it as level 1 in trying to achieve what I stated above. It’…

How do I convince a girl to do my makeup and who should I try to convince?
Just tell her that. She wouldn’t know if you don’t express what you want.
And if you already did but she refused, either you give her a good reason to, or you could just go and get some makeup yourself and put it on yourself. There’s a lot of YouTube tutorials about makeup for newbies.

What should you do if your father admitted you in an engineering college but you want to be a musician?
I’d first talk to my father about what I really want and plan in life (you do want to look like you’re actually thinking ahead for the future). If he reacted badly, I’d probably just go and complete my diploma/degree in Engineering. It doesn’t hurts to get a certificate I guess? But studying something you have no interest in is most likely going to be tough and such a suffering. However, what you studied for doesn’t determines what you’ll work as after getting that certificate. You could still be a musician. There are a lot of people who are a musician but came from a different background. It’s just a matter of how and will you go and reach out to your dream. It all comes to your priority at this point. Whether if you don’t want your father to disappointed; or you don’t want to give up your…

What strikes first time visitors as special or unusual when they arrive in Malang, Indonesia?
I’ve been living in this place for 3–4 year for education purpose.
As a student, I view this place has nice environment especially the weathers. It’s chilly almost all the time.
There are many variations of food too, hence it makes you won’t be bored to enjoy culinarily, and it’s CHEAP. so if you planned to continue your study here, it can be as one of the considerations you have.
People in here seem to be more open-minded since there are many visitors in here.
For recreation, there's a tons of choice, like Jatimpark, museum angkut, waterfall, etc.

If she told you those things, you should report her immediately. The whole point of therapy is to make you feel saved safe and accepted, if she doesn't you should find another. Hope you find one so you can feel better :)

Muslims are lagging behind because of their own doing despite all the benifits you poeple refuse to move forward stuck with your 1500 year old culture. For a community to move forward they have to accept certain practices need to be shed which you people don’t. hindus on the other hand have been open to change e.g gave up sati among other things. Muslims fight against everything that is done for the good of them.
you can come talk about hinduism when muslims accept uniform civil code.

Why didn’t you include any INDIA alliance members into “with little to no brains Or ability beyond Low Cunning needed for Politics” list? Rahul is a genius is he? or mamata? or Stalin all these are super geniuses I suppose. Because KB excludes them from his list.

What do nuns’ dress colors stand for?
As already mentioned the different Orders of (Christian) nuns have different colours (I don't know about nuns in other faiths). It is not uncommon to see Franciscans in brown or grey habits, Benedictines in black, Dominicans in white and black….there are several Orders in blue, even occasional Orders with pink or green habits.
Also, when a nun is in training (as a novice) she may wear a different coloured veil (white is common) or some variation on the full habit.
Sisters in Apostolic work (out in the community) may even be in ordinary Street clothes.
Hope that helps

Some breeds tend to use leaning more than others...Great Danes, Wolfhounds...the latter will only lean on someone they love and trust, and because they are heavy, big animals it may feel you you like a sting lean and to them just normal affection. You need to know your dog and his personality to discern his intentions, there is no one size fits all determination of behaviour. The Dogs Trust behavioural scientists have been doing some leading research and concluding that dominance issues in dogs are overplayed by most trainers and that dominance is only an issue for scared dogs, but in any pack is much more fluid from hour to hour, based on skill sets for the task in hand rather than a perceived hierarchy. It is very interesting reading. :-)

Thank you for your story ! I am so so so sorry you had to go through something like this that evidently caused you to suffer later on in life as well ! You did not deserve any of the horrible things that happened to you . Always remember that you are an amazing strong courageous person and what happened to you does not and will not ever define you ! I hope things get better for you ! You deserve nothing but the best in life !

What is the strangest test of bravery you have seen?
Sometimes engineers just have a total design fail: And you end up embarrassing people. Fortunately, her face is blurred out. Or maybe she enjoys the display. Who knows? But other times—designers were very deliberate…. Let me ask you a question. Are you brave? Would you be willing to use a toilet in a street window, in the busy part of a downtown city? Under the assumption that engineers designed it to be a one-way window: you see out, nobody sees in? Well, are you brave my child? In the words of JRR Tolkien, “Courage is found in unlikely places.”

Which actor played a villain role too well for comfort?
I'm 99% sure that Helena Bonham Carter is or knows what it's like to be mentally deranged. She is far too convincing in her roles, for my comfort. Which is why I think I love watching her movies. Not only does she appear whacked out in most of the films I've seen her in—with the exception of The King’s Speech and the new Cinderella movie—she seems to actually enjoy being whacked out a little too much. I mean, I can't think of anyone who could play Bellatrix Lestrange so well. She just fits the bill. She is the physical manifestation of pure, unadulterated anarchy. I am scared of it, taken aback by it, and in love with it, all at once.

Why didn't Lenin have children?
Infertility, probably. It happens. Lenin's wife was very beautiful in her youth (she is a blood relative of the actress Scarlett Johansen, and they are similar), but she suffered from a serious hormonal disease of the thyroid gland. Nadezhda Krupskaya in her youth, Lenin's wife, and her distant relative Scarlett Johansen.

Hi, i was looking for answers and came across an old post of yours i can only hope you're account is still active!
could u please give me advice? So I've been cleaning my hair light cool blonde for quite a while now, i did it at home a couple of weeks ago by bleaching my roots(im medium to dark brown) with bleach and 9% which gets me too very blonde, my length still has a caramel blonde to which i hated so near the end of my roots finishing i applied 6% with bleach and i always use olaplex 1 and 2. Anyways it turned out light blonde like a really light almost white blonde although i still has some uneven darker blondes to the lengths so i thought id try a semi permanent with 6% and it was meant to be a platinum cool blonde but found out it had violet in it.
i thought that would ok as to neutralise any slight yellow tinges or warmer tones…..put it on my roots first bearing in mind i have allot of grey around the front and sides (I'm 44) anyways it turned out lavender on my roots and greys, my lengths weren't as pigmented as them and it seems some lengths near the end didn't take, I'm devastated! My hair wasn't that bad before the toner :(
even though i use olaplex i still don't want to further damage my hair. I don't know what to do? I know yellow is the opposite of lavender but I'm scared to put yellow on incase it brings my blonde hair underneath to brassy yellow!
I'll attach a pic of now. I would really appreciate anyone s advice and sorry but I'm not going to a hair professional!

It’s so difficult. I know from experience, I know that this might sound rubbish and not very helpful but I feel that the only way to help or support is to stay open with communication, pray- alot and always have hope (speaking about the parents) stay supportive to addict but set boundaries. Sending you big hugs x

This is not what you want to hear but speaking from experience the only thing I can say is your family and friends should pray for you and keep communication open and honest as possible cos it sounds like you’re not ready or don’t even want to think about coming off, which is a shame as I know you’ll know you have much better things to live for and if your family and friends can talk to you about it there things you can have/do without drugs I guess that’sa start! I’m sorry if I sound pessimistic :/ when you want to come off for real you will feel it.i know it’s difficult I really do. Good luck to you and I wish you all the best x

I can understand this. Somehow I'm scarred today aft 41 years because of my mom's very loud sex life. We never talked about sex etc and when I'd walk in on them I'd be punished or frowned upon and it deeply confused me and disturbed me. I'm asexual and I always wonder if it was down to some of that or not.

What do people with borderline personality disorder wish others understood about the disorder?
I truly wish people understood that this is truly agonizing not just for the people around us ..(it agonizes me personally every second of the day )I have so many switches a day that I can’t cope or find a way to not breakdown every two hours or be disassociated sitting in the corner of my bed till my legs are numb ..
this disorder is not a kind visitor in My life
we are so worthy of love and of ourselves
I wish people knew that we are also trying to figure life out
I personally feel emotions burn at me in a harder degree and everything feels so scary and alone always

You’re welcome Therese. Therese your message makes me feel so sad … I’m glad you got pass somethings and having strength to push threw what you have been through. I really do appreciate you and you’re an inspiration and make me feel a bit confident in my situation.
I’ve been praying and I just pray for guidance knowing I’ve already done my part.
I found out he switch tax company and changed my current address to his to make it seem as if Im living with him and use our social security number to file taxes… knowing he haven’t been helping with the kids. He even got our stimulus payments since he filed as married jointly. I file a identity theft form and send it to IRS and let them know what’s going on, even let them know We have been separated from each other since 2017 and let them know he’s on child support but the people at child support couldn’t track him. It’s going on 6 months now and still haven’t received anything from IRS to take to court. I’ve been calling and they keep saying they didn’t receive my paper work and I would have to wait until 180 days. I was trying to wait for them to send me something in the mail so I can take that to court with me to show the judge what he has been doing … So that’s the thing. 🤷🏽‍♀️ But Thank you for prayers and prayers for you as well and may The Most High keeps blessing you and your love ones. Thank you again. 💖

Hi Therese
im sorry to know what happened to you and pray all is going well.
I want to ask how were you able to face him in court?
we have kids and marriage!
I try to put him on child support but they claim to not find him and it’s going on a 1 1/2 year now..:
im thinking I’m going threw trauma and don’t want to even face him at all… especially going through court! He’s a great liar and people believes his lies and I’m worried that the judge may fall for his lies… as well. I just want to be completely free by not being married to him. He don’t even care about our kids. Which is sad. smh

Thank you for your feedback! I am currently seeking professional help and have been for the last nine months. I initially went to my therapist for depression and anxiety and upon further reflection saw that I had more deeply rooted trauma issues than I realized. Unfortunately, she is not equipped to deal with trauma so I'll have to now search for another therapist. It is a blessing and a curse to see how broken I am but more of a blessing because I know and really want to get better. I am open and ready to get the help I need. Thanks again! Bless you too!

I haven't even finished reading your input and I already feel like this is one of the best analogies regarding sociopathy/narcissism I've ever read. I feel as though I possess alot of the traits of a narcissist as I've been torn for years between this inner battle of good and evil within myself. In my heart I feel intense love for those close to me. However, when I sense or feel as though I'm being rejected by them, I lash out to not just hurt them but I aim to verbally destroy and dismantle. Thank you for you comment. It brought a sense of clarity and insight to me regarding my issues.

I'm 24 years old & have been single all my life. To all ladies, have you felt lonely or with social pressure for relationships? How you managed it?
When you saw your friends , you affected from your friends , I can see this ! If you claim that you're career oriented , you should stop to worry about it... And you should go for your career , I think. You shouldn't give them that chance to block your career plans and you should achieve it ! It may be a bit hard. And maybe you're seeking for your real love , your “prince charming” but never forget this : LOVE HURTS. IN FACT , LOVE DOESN'T HURT , ITS CONDITIONS , ITS RESULTS HURTS.
And don't forget this , YOU'RE NOT AN OLD WOMAN! You can find a lover or husband finally but a career requires hard work and a huge time to achieve.

What should you do when you feel that you have no energy to do sth or anything in your life?
I can say that you should find a way to motivate yourself for living and being alive. It may be a reason to live or a goal. It is up to you. But not to have a living aim might cause depression or anything else. I am sorry if I did grammatical mistakes.

Do you miss Taehyung's bubbly personality? Be honest and please don't say that he's matured up and that we should leave him alone.
Yes. I miss it a lot.. I miss the carefree, innocent, always smiling him that when I watch old videos I cry.
I fell in love with that Taehyung. But every one changes, it's inevitable. I just wish he's always happy…

What is your unpopular opinion of NCT?
f. hey should let Chenle sing more. The boy has an amazing vocals such a waste. Heechan sometimes is too much. Idk if it's just me or nct is used to that but no hate his personality might be just like that. Over worked too, idk how where he gets energy. Mark could do good at other genre too. He hasn't even explore singing, I just wish to hear some from him. This boy is the best boy and he deserves rest. I think he really is still on his puberty, laughing at silly green jokes. I guess he's one of the most hard working and innocent idols(exclude the green stuff) 😂 Iw anted him to rest but I also miss him being with dream. Lol, mork lee. Ty, prolly the one of the least fave of mine in nct. Idk something about him is totally off. He a great leader tho, not perfect but good. Doyoung he's the best…

Idk why but being BTS Taehyung's sister is either a curse or a blessing (im not his sister omg) Any thoughts?
Well kinda, it's hard to have a brother like Tae. Many fans would probably harass you to get to your brother. You also need to think of your brother's reputation but that doesn't mean you can't be you.. I'm just saying it's hard with millions of girl wanting to know infos about your bro. But it doesn't mean it would feel like a curse having Tae as your bro, I think he's a very loving brother it's just that they didn't really grew up together that's maybe tge reason why they aren't that close too. Tae grew up with his grandparents while his siblings grew up with his parents abd of course he did left to train as an idol he has like little to no time to go home. I love the fact that only Taehyung didn't show a single pic of his siblings to protect them (atleast not officially). Everything depen…

As an INTP, I would break my heart even more just to move on,😂 translate everything first into logical way then trouble shoot problem just to be back on tract. I basically consider the guy dead.

Finally, someone that reads same as me. I've been their fan eversince 2014. I liked Taehyung since then, I knew he wasn't happy anymore and he looks like he wanted to leave but due to situations he can't. I remembered Jin saying they almost break up, he's probably one of those that wanted to leave.
He missed out so much in his family. His grandparents passing took a big impact on him since they basically raised him. He probably is a stranger to his siblings, he looks so sad when he told that he wasn't even called ‘oppa’ by her sister.
His very family oriented, I think he'll want to start his family soonest possible too.
When he leaves, I am sure hell would miss him. But I would rather see and think he's happy somewhere than see him sad and lonely. I love this guy soo much, he's the guy I liked the longest. I just want him to be happy.

This is true for me an Intp. I cut my hair shoulder length though because it's getting out of hand and I can't really show up to work not combing them. I would looked like a cavewoman 😂
But I sometimes do not comb my hair going to work 😂 I totally don't comb them when I'm just in the house.

Agreed. If you stan Taehyung long enough you'll see his ‘Done with everything but can't do anything about it’ its like he wanted to be normal person and not be famous again. Quite probably of how much idol life consumed his life, childhood and the times he could have spent with his family.
Hard times come hit him consecutively, stress from idol life, him loosing his grandparents who raised him, his friends.. He always regrets those for sure.
He never expected to blow this big, I bet.
I'm actually worried with him but thankfully he found Wooga Fam. Atleast he has his hyungs whenever he's stressed as BTS.

I agree with you. Lisa isn't the best female dancer in kpop. No hate tho, but she's not.
Eun woo kinda suffer and struggle because people only see him for his looks. He's a very talented man and he has a good personality to.
I kinda think it's hard being in a group with him because most people would only see him.

Well as an intp, it's hard to articulate ideas that you need to draw. Most of the times, i think of the ideas with weird image that kinda produce a huge map for the thought.
Also ideas come fast and most it's an idea after an idea that we forget how we come to that…
I'm having hard time explaining how we think 😂

As an Intp-t, my room would be small like there would be just a bed for sleeping and a blank wall that does not have a light entrance 😂
While other parts of the house would probably have a mini museum, a huge library/office that is sometimes tidy and most of the time chaotic but organized 😂
And a secret room where you put confidencial theories and evidence 😂
A receiving and dinning area where the only area guest would be allowed.
A garden, low maintenance plants 😂 preferably useful plants.
Ooh and also a bathroom with a tub and a television. 😂

What is the bitter truth about children?
Generally, Parents care children and expect their children to care them, at least emotionally, in their old age. Most of the parents even sacrifices many of their dreams and financial goals for the sake of their children’s future. Thus, Parents are very emotionally involved with children. However, in general, when those children become adult, they are less likely to be caring emotionally or otherwise to their parents. So, the bitter truth about children is: PARENTS IN THEIR OLD AGE, ARE MOSTLY GOING TO BE HURT BY THEIR CHILDREN. This is more true for the collectivist Asian Societies such as India and Nepal than Individualistic western societies.

I've been through this, if you are nursing and off medication it may be an idea to go formula so that you can start meds, I know it sounds clichéd to say give it time and I remember being where you are, but remember your bpd may make you feel OK one hour and awful the next, look into having a safety plan in place for when you are feeling in crisis, someone you can call, something you can touch to ground you, anything that pulls you through that moment, it probably feels like time is standing still, my little one is now 5 and my reason for staying alive… You will get through this, you are strong, you're a survivor, you've survived this illness so far, keep going xx

Well said, as someone with bpd I occasionally read things on here which nine times out of ten are just stereotyping and insulting. The intensity of each emotion is all consuming and I don't believe anyone would choose this life. Still such a stigma around bpd.

Should I forgive my girl? She cheated on me and lied. She didn’t even when I caught her. The reason for cheating was financial assistance and trying to choose between both of us.
No, if someone can’t decipher between two people, then they should not have a relationship with either. Financial issues come and go, that’s not an excuse for infidelity.

simply put, leave this toxicity of a “family” you’re not their servant you to have your own life, home, wants and needs. Leave them behind as a mere distant memory that soon shall be forgotten ever existed in your brain cells. You deserve better, they are taking advantage of your kindness, efforts, mind/feelings, and are attempting to brainwash you with their disgraceful behavior. Please love yourself, learn to forgive them and move on, life is short there shall be someone out there somewhere who prays for you, for your heart, your kind demeanor and that accepts you as a daughter in law that they treat just as their own and doesn’t put one above the other nor work you to your core. You’re perhaps young now, leave while you are not married bc this isn’t going to ever ever everrr get better hun’. 🤍🤍 I hope you find peace and tranquility in your life again. Life goes on and i’ll let you know now, no matter who he ends up marrying, they shall treat her the same most likely. Narcissistic behavior, overly codependent, disrespectful people use kind ppl bc they know they can sink their claws into them and latch on. You must break this soonest, turn back and never return before you end up having children who also will suffer in such pain and emptiness with you. This is not the family you belong in. You would not want this for someone, so why for yourself. Love is fleeting, respect is always.

Hi hun, love yourself first, after all things shall follow. This guy is feeding you attn, not love. Love grows.. it is not pushed and pressed upon. You’re overthinking, overcompensating, as well as indulging to much personal info.. guys aren’t ones to vent to, find a mirror and speak to yourself, find a girlfriend who is older and wiser. They will help you realize to seek honest, partnership/relationships in life and love. It also helps to get a cat/dog.. those are your best friends.. talk to them, they will truly love you for you. Also remember people are replaceable, life is so high strung for most folks and men have bigger and better things to think about then being in a relationship, especially older men. Listen to the other advices on this forum as well.

That's why most hospitals, hospice care, and long term care facilities are supposed to have visiting programs and pet programs (where certified companion animals come and visit bc lots of studies have proven the health benefits of just petting a calm, friendly animal).

Has a chiropractor ever accidentally killed their patient by adjusting or manipulating their cervical spine incorrectly?
To my knowledge there have been approximately 60,000 cases of strokes after cervical manipulation (the “neck-snapping”) in the last 20 years and many of those could have been prevented had simple ultrasounds of the carotid artery in the neck and other arteries in the upper body had been done. Ultrasound is one of the best tools a chiropractor can use followed by x-ray and EMG (measures muscular stress similar to an ECG for the heart) yet I've only seen these tools used in big sports physical therapy centres. This is one reason why I refuse to have my neck adjusted. I am even wary of having it massaged by someone else these days and only go to an extremely reputable sports centre if I feel like I need any kind of help with my joints and/or muscles. I will stretch and massage my own neck but…

Isn't it unhealthy to soak your hands in a bowl of acetone for 15 minutes in order to remove artificial nails?
YES!! You can cause permanent damage to your skin, not to mention absorbing that much acetone especially time and time again you can and probably will poison yourself. Your safest method is to use little pads which are presoaked in acetone (or other nail glue removal chemicals) and then wrapped individually so you get consistent amounts of the acetone for each nail. I personally don't wear artificial nails but a friend of mine who does uses those teensy tiny rubber bands that are usually used for very small braids to wrap the pads around the edges of your nails and hold them there. I've also seen one of her friends just open the top of the packet and slide the whole thing onto the end of her fingers and mold the packet with the pad on the the top onto/around the nail. This way you aren't l…

What happens to disabled people’s disability in their dreams?
I've been ill for most of my life now and I'm ill in my dreams. I'm unsure about my vision problems though. However, I'm always able to walk and even skate still (was competitive figureskater before illness) in my dreams. I've only been confined to wheelchair for about 10 years and in many ways I have not accepted it because the injury is fixable through surgery and for some reason my previous doctors never bothered to help me. I could still get the foot and ankle fixed but it's doubtful I will be able to really walk much. I guess I live out my hopes and wishes in my dreams.

Do nails grow even after death?
In a quick word? No. Here's why in a nutshell.
It only seems like they've grown because your skin eventually retracts away from the nail beds and loses its plumpness from around the rest of the finger.
There's alot that goes on after death but death is death. That means nothing is growing or changing. No cell division. Despite the rumour that your hair and nails are the dead parts of you, that's just not true, otherwise they would never grow at all.

Should I offer to push someone in a wheelchair if I see them on the street?
Short answer: NO!! You wouldn't tolerate some random stranger just touching you, would you? Or tolerate them moving you anywhere? Not without your permission, that's for sure! I have this issue Every. Single. Time. I go shopping or otherwise am out. My suggestion is to observe whether or not the person is struggling. Approach them directly so they see you coming and say: “You seem to be having a little difficulty. May I help?” if they consent, always ask if they're ready and how fast to go before you start to push. DO NOT breathe down their neck, talk for them to others or otherwise treat them as infants. We are smart, we are capable, we are fiercely independent. So, PLEASE! Do not get mad or upset with us if we decline. And remember that even abled-bodied people need help sometimes and it…

How can I stop my nail extensions from hurting?
Very easy and simple answer. Take proper care of your real nails and grow them out. We live in such an artificial world today and it's astonishing to the point of being ludicrous, even disgusting. Let me share a secret with you… most adults are truly turned off by all this artiface, especially when it comes to how one looks. The more natural one looks, the more likely they are to be truly happy, have the best self-confidence (not arrogance)and are all around healthier in body, mind and spirit than the rest of us. Pain means something is very wrong. If those artificial nails are hurting and you continue on wearing them, there's a possibility of doing irreparable damage to the nail beds and you could face the future having no nails whatsoever. (I got this info from a friend who teaches all asp…

Did your child ever beg for the spanking to stop? Im asking this because when I got spanked I was embarrased to beg or even cry
i have never spanked a child, but i was spanked myself. sometimes i begged for it to stop, sometimes i accepted it. it is natural for a child to beg for an abuser to stop abusing them. it is also natural for a child to freeze up in fear of humiliation or worse punishment. these are just natural responses to physical abuse, whether cognitively dissonant abusers want to admit it or not. science has proven it.

Did you ever get spanked as a child?
Yes. It taught me that violence was an acceptable reaction to behavior I didn't like. I recall even saying once to someone I hit that I was punishing and training them. I was a regrettably violent child. Once I realized that spanking was wrong I became far less violent.and less violent until I stopped ever responding with it.

try and feed him a high quality cat food for digestive care. little meals like chicken breast and brown rice occasionally are also good. make sure to give him a feeding schedule rather than free feeding him. there are over the counter medications specifically for cat vomiting, and i think it would work for acid reflux. dont try and give a human cures to him tho, even baking soda is poisonous to cats when ingested in moderate quantities. i would highly recommend going to the vet asap. they could really look into your cat and figure out the best diet for him, as well as give you some medication.
he sounds adorable, a lil old chubby dude

absolutely normal. Trust me, don't feel bad if you can helped it. been through it countless times and the good thing is that i respect if they don't wanna hang out! id rather have a tiny amount of friends who genuinely wanna hang with me than vice versa. if anything people leaving has taught me to be in control of myself and to give 0 f67ks

It’s something that people like us face in life from time to time. But you’re pretty young so trust me when I say, as you get older, people mature. Well most people. They’re still the people that never mature. But things really do get easier and peoples minds do change. I was bullied in middle school for having a secret girlfriend (she outed me). My parents were against it lgbtq. But guess what? I am 23. I don’t get bullied anymore. Most people don’t care about my orientation. And those who do care say they still love and care about me. And my parents? My dad and I joke all the time about me liking girls and my mom actually has a girlfriend now (my parents are divorced). People do change. I’ll leave you with this quote by Ellen Degeneres
“things will get easier, people’s minds will change, and you should be alive to see it”
stay strong!

Hey Zoe. I can see how devastating that can feel. I can almost relate to some of your story. But remember, how you feel right now is not permanent. Feelings fade. Things improve. I would recommend that you go see someone since you took pills. If you’re too afraid to say you took pills, then you could ask to see a doctor just for a check up. They’ll take your blood and make sure your organs and everything is functioning okay. Stay strong please.

Some people are known to faint at the sight of blood. Or even losing blood. The closest experience I had to this was the last time I cut, I started feeling very light headed, weak, and shaky. But I never passed out. It was scary because I felt like I would. So it’s not uncommon.

I hate to say this but this sounds like NPD not BPD.

As a person with BPD, do you get along with other people with BPD?
I posting this question because I am diagnosed with BPD. But I’ve found that every time I make a friend with BPD they end up dramatically ending the friendship, push me away, or argue with me over something. In short, I never am friends with another borderline for long. Our personalities don’t mesh. Everything is great at first because we relate but then it just becomes a mess. So not to discriminate against my own disorder. They are awesome people. But I just choose not to pursue friendships with people with BPD anymore. Because I know where it’s headed and I’m tired of being burned.

Story of my life. Dealing with someone who promises to always stay and then eventually leaves us is an agonizing pain. It feels like a stab in the guts. And I’ve had to go through it so many times. I relate.

My landlord is evicting me because I'm 2 years late on rent. How do I tell him I'm not leaving no matter what?
You tell him just like that. How he reacts is up to him. I have rental property and if it where me, I'd wait for you to leave one day. Once you were gone I would get into the house and then instantly change the locks. I would immediately call some friends to come over and help me toss your shit into my truck, expensive things first and anything with your name on it would be taken away. I'd also have a lease drawn up with one of my friends names on it. You would eventually come back and find yourself locked out and us inside. You'd probably get upset and threaten to call the police (we would encourage that) and you would probably threaten to sue me for some kind of “illegal eviction"". I'd wait for the police to arrive and show them my mortgage paperwork and the new lease agreement I had. I would refuse to answer any other of the polices questions and keep telling them that it's a civil matter and that you could sue me if you wanted. They would eventually agree and they would tell you to take me to court but that you would have to leave the property for now. You wouldn't actually take me to court because you don't have any money. If by some chance you did happen to take me to court, and you still had time on your lease, I would just say you abandoned the property. You would say you didn't and the judge would ask you for rent receipts or other proof and you wouldn't have any and that would be that. Edit: So, there are lots of people who are saying that if I did this then I would be arrested on the spot and I’ll get sued and lose everything and don’t take my advice and on and on, so first lets address some things. 1) The original question was “How do I tell my landlord…” and my advice was to just tell them. That is the only advice I gave. The next was what I would do in this ridiculous situation, not advice for YOU. 2) For those that say “You would be instantly arrested” or whatever, I’d love to take credit for this idea, however it’s ALREADY BEEN DONE by a man named Flash Shelton and to the best of my knowledge he has not been to jail, prison, sued, etc and offers his services to others. Here is a link to the NY post story about him for anyone who would like to read. https://nypost.com/2023/08/11/handyman-flash-shelton-has-cracked-the-squatters-system/ 3) Like I said earlier, this whole thing is ridiculous to start with because after the first month of no rent payment I would give you a date to leave before I would file for an eviction hearing. If you made me evict you and then and you didn’t leave, the Sheriff would be notified, and they’d make you leave. However, if you came back and were somehow squatting, (Which is exactly what your doing) on my property like that, then we move on to the next level! You can like my answer and my methods or not, I don’t really care. You do you. At this point I’m tired of my email inbox getting flooded with “UP” votes and comments from every jail house lawyer so I will be turning comments and notifications off!

Whoever lead you to believe that did so to control their perspective…that's an opinion.. in my “opinion"" I think you're asking the wrong question…it comes off like you want to know if they think of you horribly…your horribly…you're fascinated by someone feeling that way about you…but I know nothing.

What do narcissists feel inside?
Hunger for things most can't comprehend. Not food nor water at time. To indulge in a chemical reaction within the mind. To sense the switch when something makes sense. They lie and act in ways to gain things they don't need or want. Impulses

What is the best advice when having to use texts or messaging as the main form of communication with a narcissist?
Stay punctual! Things can be thrown in your face. Like money, dates numbers or past conversations. Manipulated in word form. Just keep track of what is said.

What makes a psychopath irritable?
Say you 2 know each other and each other's regiments, reactions to most things etcetera.. now imagine they asked you to do them a favor. Wait until there's a crowd, people to witness. (They can't react) break some awkward response ya or no. But do it unlike yourself…just an example
Now that would rattle their bell

I asked in that manner because organizations can have executives, but aren’t mentioned in an IPO filing for example (i.e. SVPs and VPs). So for the sake of this question, I made the distinction.
