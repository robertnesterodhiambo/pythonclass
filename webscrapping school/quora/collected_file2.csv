had therapy today and it was rough. really, really rough. i‚Äôve been struggling a lot lately with extremely intense anxiety/panic attacks and convincing myself of things that are just not true. brought it up today and just spilled everything. i never do that, not because i don‚Äôt trust my therapist, but because im very insecure about my issues lol. but it felt nice? it was like a breath of fresh air. i felt really drained afterwards though and had to spent the rest of the day and evening in my room alone while listening to music or watching videos on a low volume so i didn‚Äôt overstimulate myself anymore. couldn‚Äôt really bring myself to talk to much of anyone and i've had a horrible headache since? probably stress related but i don‚Äôt know. overall, it was a good session, and i feel like i‚Äôm making progress in terms of actually vocalizing my struggles and internal battles. quite proud of myself even though it was hard on me ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Do you think that therapists don't admit it but sometimes secretly feel flattered, complimented or good about themselves when clients have romantic or sexual feelings/fantasies about them? After all they're real feelings.

i‚Äôve been seeing my current therapist for a little over 3 years. it varies a lot especially because of the differences among people. some people have anxiety, some have trauma, some have childhood trauma, list goes on. and all those things need different levels of care, different kinds of therapies, therapists, etc. so it depends on the client and their wants and needs.

What do you want from your therapist?
What I want is something I can never get. I am almost 30 years old. I have been in frustrating or difficult situations my entire life. I‚Äôve had to care for those around me for decades. There have even been numerous times where my life was in danger. The one thing I have wanted, ever since I was a little girl, was for someone to stand up for me just one time. Someone to say, ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre not treating her fairly and that isn‚Äôt acceptable‚Äù. Someone who could have kept me safe. I often even fantasize about having him there at a family holiday and when inevitably someone turns their sights onto tearing me down, he steps in while the others, as always happens, sit there pretending like it isn‚Äôt going on. But no. I can‚Äôt be saved by anyone but myself. As I‚Äôve done since childhood, I will always have to be the one to stand up for myself. I‚Äôm just tired of it being only my job.

My therapist said she‚Äôs not supposed to have feelings. How are you supposed to deal with that? She said if she had feelings, she would be a bad therapist. Has anyone else experienced this?
It is possible that your therapist wanted to explain that she cannot mix subjectivity with professional expertise. You consult a therapist to gain a better understanding of your personal experience, situation, difficulty and you need to know that your therapist is not reacting as someone who is on your side as a friend or judgemental. We train to handle what the patient is experiencing with knowledge and qualification, not with emotions. Asking your therapist about personal involvement will neither help you or give her the trust in her expertise you need to work towards solutions or comprehension.

If my thirteen-year-old daughter is not doing anything bad, what reason would she have to be ""uncomfortable"" with me placing a camera in her room?
first of all, why would you even want to do that when you stated that she doesn‚Äôt do anything bad? second of all, that is a clear boundary being crossed & you‚Äôre invading her personal space/privacy. i‚Äôd be very uncomfortable too, even while knowing i don‚Äôt do anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù. if she doesn‚Äôt do anything to give you any logical reason to do this, then what gave you the idea of it in the first place? let me talk about bedrooms real quick. you said your daughter is 13, correct? she‚Äôs still a child, by law. i‚Äôd be lying if i said i didn‚Äôt find this creepy. but anyway, bedrooms are a place for anyone of any age to find comfort, peace, privacy, and a space to do as they please without judgement. you‚Äôre taking those aspects away & for what exactly? when i was her age, i went to my room to hide from the‚Ä¶

i wish so MUCH that you were correct. i WISH it weren‚Äôt a thing. i wish i didn‚Äôt have to experience dp/dr everyday for months at a time, crying until i can‚Äôt anymore just because i‚Äôm frustrated at the fact that it won‚Äôt go away. im currently dealing with an episode that has been going on for 4 weeks now. was looking for other peoples‚Äô experiences just so i didn‚Äôt feel so alone. THIS is what brings stigma to disorders like these. i am miserable. i cant function during these episodes. i hope so badly that you experience this to the severity of how i do & how others do just for a couple days. then maybe, just maybe, you won‚Äôt deny the realness of something so exhausting & dreadful.
it is statistically proven that when people deal with dp/dr their brain looks different than the normal human brain. it‚Äôs a real thing. but i do wish so so badly that it weren‚Äôt a real thing.

Do therapists ever go to patients' houses for sessions, instead of the patients coming to their office?
yes.
the last therapy place i was going to did intensive therapy. which was twice a week & the therapist came to the client‚Äôs house since the client was seen to be too unmotivated to go anywhere. that was usually what i‚Äôd do, cause you had to meet criteria for it.
it‚Äôs different for every place, though. this is just my experience.

Therapy clients, if you self harm and told your therapist, how did they react? Did they try to see your cuts?
no, he did not try to see them. he responded with great empathy & reassurance. he made sure i knew that he was appreciative of me being able to share that with him; reminding me that relapse happens.
then we usually come up with ways to avoid it from happening again.
at the beginning, he reassured me that he wouldn‚Äôt send me somewhere (a psychiatric facility) over it unless i refused to help myself & continued to get worse with it.

Why are some people lucky enough to have good parents and others are not? Is there a reason? Why do good people not have the loving parents they deserve?
because life sucks, literally.
i‚Äôve always had that mindset ‚Äúthe best people get the hardest obstacles‚Äù because it‚Äôs completely true.
the best people die young.
the most innocent, loving children get the worst parents.
the best people are in poverty while the greedy people are millionaires.
it‚Äôs stupid, it really is. i wish i had a better response, but this is just the unfortunate truth.
good people deserve everything + more. it saddens me how cruel life is.
