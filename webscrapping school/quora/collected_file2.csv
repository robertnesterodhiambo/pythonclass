had therapy today and it was rough. really, really rough. i‚Äôve been struggling a lot lately with extremely intense anxiety/panic attacks and convincing myself of things that are just not true. brought it up today and just spilled everything. i never do that, not because i don‚Äôt trust my therapist, but because im very insecure about my issues lol. but it felt nice? it was like a breath of fresh air. i felt really drained afterwards though and had to spent the rest of the day and evening in my room alone while listening to music or watching videos on a low volume so i didn‚Äôt overstimulate myself anymore. couldn‚Äôt really bring myself to talk to much of anyone and i've had a horrible headache since? probably stress related but i don‚Äôt know. overall, it was a good session, and i feel like i‚Äôm making progress in terms of actually vocalizing my struggles and internal battles. quite proud of myself even though it was hard on me ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Do you think that therapists don't admit it but sometimes secretly feel flattered, complimented or good about themselves when clients have romantic or sexual feelings/fantasies about them? After all they're real feelings.

i‚Äôve been seeing my current therapist for a little over 3 years. it varies a lot especially because of the differences among people. some people have anxiety, some have trauma, some have childhood trauma, list goes on. and all those things need different levels of care, different kinds of therapies, therapists, etc. so it depends on the client and their wants and needs.

What do you want from your therapist?
What I want is something I can never get. I am almost 30 years old. I have been in frustrating or difficult situations my entire life. I‚Äôve had to care for those around me for decades. There have even been numerous times where my life was in danger. The one thing I have wanted, ever since I was a little girl, was for someone to stand up for me just one time. Someone to say, ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre not treating her fairly and that isn‚Äôt acceptable‚Äù. Someone who could have kept me safe. I often even fantasize about having him there at a family holiday and when inevitably someone turns their sights onto tearing me down, he steps in while the others, as always happens, sit there pretending like it isn‚Äôt going on. But no. I can‚Äôt be saved by anyone but myself. As I‚Äôve done since childhood, I will always have to be the one to stand up for myself. I‚Äôm just tired of it being only my job.

My therapist said she‚Äôs not supposed to have feelings. How are you supposed to deal with that? She said if she had feelings, she would be a bad therapist. Has anyone else experienced this?
It is possible that your therapist wanted to explain that she cannot mix subjectivity with professional expertise. You consult a therapist to gain a better understanding of your personal experience, situation, difficulty and you need to know that your therapist is not reacting as someone who is on your side as a friend or judgemental. We train to handle what the patient is experiencing with knowledge and qualification, not with emotions. Asking your therapist about personal involvement will neither help you or give her the trust in her expertise you need to work towards solutions or comprehension.

If my thirteen-year-old daughter is not doing anything bad, what reason would she have to be ""uncomfortable"" with me placing a camera in her room?
first of all, why would you even want to do that when you stated that she doesn‚Äôt do anything bad? second of all, that is a clear boundary being crossed & you‚Äôre invading her personal space/privacy. i‚Äôd be very uncomfortable too, even while knowing i don‚Äôt do anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù. if she doesn‚Äôt do anything to give you any logical reason to do this, then what gave you the idea of it in the first place? let me talk about bedrooms real quick. you said your daughter is 13, correct? she‚Äôs still a child, by law. i‚Äôd be lying if i said i didn‚Äôt find this creepy. but anyway, bedrooms are a place for anyone of any age to find comfort, peace, privacy, and a space to do as they please without judgement. you‚Äôre taking those aspects away & for what exactly? when i was her age, i went to my room to hide from the‚Ä¶

i wish so MUCH that you were correct. i WISH it weren‚Äôt a thing. i wish i didn‚Äôt have to experience dp/dr everyday for months at a time, crying until i can‚Äôt anymore just because i‚Äôm frustrated at the fact that it won‚Äôt go away. im currently dealing with an episode that has been going on for 4 weeks now. was looking for other peoples‚Äô experiences just so i didn‚Äôt feel so alone. THIS is what brings stigma to disorders like these. i am miserable. i cant function during these episodes. i hope so badly that you experience this to the severity of how i do & how others do just for a couple days. then maybe, just maybe, you won‚Äôt deny the realness of something so exhausting & dreadful.
it is statistically proven that when people deal with dp/dr their brain looks different than the normal human brain. it‚Äôs a real thing. but i do wish so so badly that it weren‚Äôt a real thing.

Do therapists ever go to patients' houses for sessions, instead of the patients coming to their office?
yes.
the last therapy place i was going to did intensive therapy. which was twice a week & the therapist came to the client‚Äôs house since the client was seen to be too unmotivated to go anywhere. that was usually what i‚Äôd do, cause you had to meet criteria for it.
it‚Äôs different for every place, though. this is just my experience.

Therapy clients, if you self harm and told your therapist, how did they react? Did they try to see your cuts?
no, he did not try to see them. he responded with great empathy & reassurance. he made sure i knew that he was appreciative of me being able to share that with him; reminding me that relapse happens.
then we usually come up with ways to avoid it from happening again.
at the beginning, he reassured me that he wouldn‚Äôt send me somewhere (a psychiatric facility) over it unless i refused to help myself & continued to get worse with it.

Why are some people lucky enough to have good parents and others are not? Is there a reason? Why do good people not have the loving parents they deserve?
because life sucks, literally.
i‚Äôve always had that mindset ‚Äúthe best people get the hardest obstacles‚Äù because it‚Äôs completely true.
the best people die young.
the most innocent, loving children get the worst parents.
the best people are in poverty while the greedy people are millionaires.
it‚Äôs stupid, it really is. i wish i had a better response, but this is just the unfortunate truth.
good people deserve everything + more. it saddens me how cruel life is.

What are the signs that someone has re-idealized you after devaluing you (BPD)?
two things: run and read this, my SO, Donna, left me after a psychotic episode in Maine where she threatened to kill me in my sleep!!! as an addict and AA sponsor she took off to california, now Ohio. in seach of a guy to solve her bpd/bi polar issues. they never end without therapy. this could be Donnas sad story, i learned humility; there was a long list before me‚Ä¶, BPD High functioning people with BPD primarily discover the BPD though the sudden idealizations and devaluations where they can begin to notice that a problem exists. Also if someone knows exact how BPD affects people it is super easy to spot. Below I am attaching a good summary of BPD behaviors. I hope it helps. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a hereditary, genetic condition that significantly affects emotions, sense of self, memory and interpersonal relationships. Studies reveal extensive differences in brain structure and function. BPD is often triggered from the interplay of genetics with trauma during childhood. It is suspected that during early childhood, increased levels of cortisol caused by stress (trauma) permanently change the brain structure and function of those genetically predisposed to it (such as increased gray matter in the amygdala area, among other things), causing BPD. While there is no cure, BPD is very treatable with Dialectical Behavior Therapy that was specifically designed for people with BPD (by a person with BPD) and can give someone the tools to recognize and manage the symptoms. BPD is a disorder of Dysregulation made up by Emotion Dysregulation (the core of BPD), as well as, Interpersonal, Identity, Behavioral, and Cognitive Dysregulation. More specifically, BPD causes intense emotions that are difficult to control and manage (i.e. ‚ÄúEmotion Dysregulation‚Äù) including unreasonable Fear of Abandonment which is central to BPD. BPD is primarily noticed through interpersonal relationships (‚ÄúInterpersonal Dysregulation‚Äù): Persons with BPD (PBPD) feel all emotions intensely, therefore, when they like someone (either in friendship or romantically) PBPDs will love that person intensely. If the other person reciprocates then they will both be enmeshed in a very intense and personal relationship. PBPDs see the world through Black and White Thinking. Themselves and others are viewed as either ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù. There are very few gray areas, if any. For example, it is difficult for a PBPD to be angry at a loved one and recognize that - while the PBPD is angry at them - the PBPD still loves them. Conversely, if a loved one is angry at the PBPD then the PBPD will view either themselves or the loved one as ‚ÄúBad‚Äù, because for them, someone who is ‚Äúgood‚Äù would never criticize or make them feel sad. Thinking is generally Black and White or Good vs Bad. When a PBPD loves you, they will make you the center of their lives. This phase is called ‚ÄúIdealization‚Äù and the loved one is viewed as ‚Äúall good‚Äù. PBPDs also feel intense fear of abandonment - and in order to avoid the possibility that a genuine loved one will abandon them - they will unconsciously suddenly start to hate (‚ÄúDevalue‚Äù) their loved ones in a process called Splitting (which will also completely change their memories of such a person). In addition to Fear of Abandonment, many PBPDs experience ‚ÄúFear of Engulfment‚Äù. As mentioned above, close relationships for PBPDs are very emotionally intense, and because PBPDs are afraid that their loved ones will Abandon them, they are also afraid of getting very close to such loved ones in the first place. If you are in a close relationship with someone with BPD, it may feel like they are pulling you closer with one hand, while at the same time pushing you away with their other hand. BPD relationships are often a balancing act between Fear of Abandonment and Fear of Engulfment. It is due to those fears that Splitting and Devaluation occurs, despite the fact that they attempt to accelerate relationships. Splitting occurs primarily, but not exclusively, against those people PBPDs feel like ‚Äúthey cannot live without‚Äù. At the suspicion of real or imagined abandonment, suddenly (overnight), the loved one will be viewed as ‚Äúall bad‚Äù and all their behaviors become suspect with malevolent ulterior motives. The entire relationship is completely forgotten and replaced with an alternate reality where the former loved one was always ‚Äúall bad‚Äù and the two were never enmeshed in an intense, loving and personal relationship. This phase is called ‚ÄúDevaluation‚Äù. PBPDs also Devalue people they feel threatened by or who make them feel insecure. It is important to note that BPD causes fragmentation of memory including, lack of object constancy, lack of whole object relations, ‚Äúemotional amnesia‚Äù as well as outright False Memories (things that never quite happened, but feel as true to PBPDs as anything else). This peculiar problem with memory means that PBPDs only remember others based on their last encounter and continuously color the entire relationship based on each last encounter (i.e. they are unable to link the past with the present. Because of the lack of object constancy, they can only live in the present). Because PBPDs memories are fragmented, it becomes exceedingly difficult to trust others. PBPDs experience difficulty intergrading what they know about someone into a cohesive image. It is not uncommon for PBPDs to believe that loved ones will betray them at any moment. For reasons that are not yet fully understood, the PBPD‚Äôs mind cannot integrate a consistent perception of others based on past experience. The past cannot be integrated with the present. For a PBPD, given the opportunity, anyone may do anything, no matter how absurd under the circumstances or how out of character it would be. As such, PBPDs are unable to exhibit normal levels of trust. PBPD memories are based on their present feelings and not the actual past (i.e. for PBPDs, their emotions and feelings dictate their reality, instead of facts.). A distorted view and understanding of reality is one of the major issues of BPD. Without treatment, PBPDs are generally unaware that their memories and perception of reality are distorted. If a PBPD Devalues you, then you will be remembered as always having been an unworthy person who they don‚Äôt particularly like (even though up until yesterday you were the center on their lives and could do no wrong). Any attempt to remind an untreated PBPD of the past will cause them confusion and cognitive dissonance. Untreated PBPDs will ultimately rationalize their behavior even against overwhelming facts. For PBPDs, how they presently feel about something, makes it the absolute and only truth, this extends to their failure at business ventures and personal finance. In short, when a PBPD loves someone intensely, the fear of abandonment will be so overwhelming and all-consuming that the mind, in order to protect itself from those overwhelming emotions, will suddenly ‚Äúflip a switch‚Äù and cause to PBPD to suddenly feel nothing for the loved one, hate them and lose all their memories of ever loving them. Sadly, unless treated, the effects of BPD on a PBPD can only be called tragic. There is a relevant and well-known quote by a certain Dr.Syndenh that accurately describes the unfortunate effects that BPD has on the sufferers: ‚ÄúThey love without measure those they will soon hate without reason‚Äù. Once Devalued, the loved one will notice a very drastic, sudden change in the PBPD‚Äôs behavior towards them‚Äì the person who was extremely loving yesterday and the two of you were inseparable, now treats you like a persona non grata for no apparent reason while denying anything is different. The Devaluation phase completely erases the loving and close relationship. The PBPD will be unable to remember that they once had strong feelings for you. For those close to a PBPD (such as close friends, life partners, family members etc.) it may feel as the PBPD has two personas, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde, where neither the Dr. Jekyll nor the Mr. Hyde persona is aware that the other persona exists. When the Mr. Hyde persona (i.e. the persona with BPD) comes out, the PBPD loses all recollection that the loved one is actually a genuine love one. Again, the loved one is instead viewed as having always been an unworthy and a manipulative person who the PBPD never really cared for. From a loved one‚Äôs perspective, the two distinct personalities appear as two very different people (and they might as well be), each with their own separate memories and behaviors. In fact, the two personalities view reality itself very differently. It is important for loved ones to become familiar with the behaviors of each personality and know which personality they are dealing with at all times. At the exact moment of Devaluation, PBPDs may start planning and implementing their exit strategy from the relationship (since they now hate/dislike the other person). The PBPD may unconsciously create a false and negative narrative regarding the former loved one, justifying any actions the PBPD takes. Typically, this involves a lot of rationalization as well as the elaborate manipulation and gaslighting of the former loved one that PBPDs are known for. Rationalization, manipulation, distortions and gaslighting are not done consciously or with malice, but are simply the result of whatever the PBPD feels is true at the time. As mentioned previously, PBPD perception of reality is based on present feelings (and during Devaluation, they will believe, beyond any doubt, that the former loved one is a person with little to no worth). This is as part of the famous ‚ÄúI hate you, don‚Äôt leave me‚Äù phase. In this phase the PBPD will be emotionally distant and very mean to the former loved one (‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù), but at the same time, due to the Fear of Abandonment, they will also take steps to convince the former loved one not to disappear from their life (‚Äúdon‚Äôt leave me‚Äù). Needless to say this is a very toxic phase. Alternatively, a PBPD may suddenly disappear from the former loved one‚Äôs life completely (they now want nothing to do with the devalued loved one) while the Fear of Abandonment may cause them reappear later. It‚Äôs possible for the PBPD to slowly love the devalued person again (after all, the person they liked initially is still the same person), starting the cycle of idealization and devaluation all over again. Until the PBPD receives treatment, devaluation of loved ones is inevitable and at some point, this cycle will break into permanent devaluation. To those familiar with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), this repeating cycle similar to the famous NPD cycle (popularly known as the ‚ÄúIdealization, Devaluation, Discard, Hoover‚Äù cycle), but it is rooted in completely different reasons (as explained above). The Broccoli allegory: A silly, but easy to explain way of how BPD works in relationships is this following allegory involving delicious broccoli: Imagine that you really like broccoli, and you want it to be a healthy part of your life. If you have BPD, the disorder will cause you to fear that broccoli will disappear from your life forever and you will no longer be able to have it: ‚ÄúI am sure the broccoli market will collapse and I will not longer be able to get it from anywhere!‚Äù The fear is overwhelming and you start to hate and devalue broccoli rather than lose it: ‚ÄúYou know what? I never really liked broccoli and I don‚Äôt care if I will not be able to have it in the future anymore. It tastes terrible and I am sure it‚Äôs bad for me. I want nothing to do with broccoli and I am cutting out of my life.‚Äù BPD will also cause you to forget that you ever liked broccoli, and create false memories and false rationalizations of the past: ‚ÄúWhy was I eating broccoli until now? I am sure there is a reason. Maybe I was eating broccoli because my roommate always brought some home, and I only ate broccoli because I used it with that sauce that I like. I only liked the sauce, not the broccoli! Yeah, I am sure that was the only reason. After all, broccoli sucks and I would never genuine like it. In fact, now that I think about it, I was not really eating broccoli all that often anyways, and the very few times I was, I certainly never cared for it‚Äù. Then, you may stop eating broccoli altogether: ‚ÄúGood thing I no longer have to deal with that disgusting broccoli‚Äù. With that said, fear of abandonment is central to BPD and it does not go away: ‚ÄúMaybe I should not cut broccoli completely out of my life. I think I will keep it around a bit - even though I certainly don‚Äôt like it and will treat it with the contempt it deserves‚Äù. Then, because you actually like broccoli, you may start warming up to it again: ‚ÄúOh hey, this broccoli does not taste bad! It really should be part of my life!‚Äù At that point, the Cycle begins all over again until the circumstances are such that you permanently devalue broccoli forever (even though, if not for BPD, there would be no reason you would not be enjoying broccoli for the rest of your life). Again, this allegory is a bit silly, but hopefully it makes a good point. Another important aspect to remember which is common with many PBPDs is that the Black and White Thinking causes PBPDs to Project their own flaws or bad behaviors on others. This type of thinking is the reason why many PBPDs find it difficult to admit fault even against overwhelming evidence. For a PBPD, admitting fault in anything would, in the PBDP‚Äôs mind, mean that the he/she is ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Therefore, the ‚Äúbad‚Äù actions or behaviors are often Projected on others. Their failure to execute business plans or being a successful business person is always blamed on someone else. BPD may also cause ‚ÄúUnstable of a Sense of Self‚Äù. PBPDs find it difficult to form a coherent image of themselves and their likes/dislikes. As such, when PBPDs Idealize someone, they will often change their personality to match that person‚Äôs (as there are unsure of what their own personality is). This ‚Äúchameleon effect‚Äù can occur both consciously and unconsciously. There are many stories of previously idealized persons, reconnecting with their PBPD former loved ones, and being very surprised that the PBPD now has a very different personality than the one they were familiar with. There is also a distinction in behavior between Traditional and Quiet BPD. A person with ‚ÄúTraditional BPD‚Äù will express intense bouts of anger and rage towards the former loved one, while a person with ‚ÄúQuiet BPD‚Äù will simply become cold and distant. (Note: Quiet PBPDs experience the same intense anger as Traditional PBPDs, but instead of expressing those feelings outwards, they are internalized). It is important to note that PBPD s Idealize and Devalue themselves as well as others. They may confident and proud in themselves one moment, but the next moment see themselves as terrible persons who do not deserve love, friendships or success in life. BPD can cause a host of other symptoms, such as: Getting angry or upset very easily and finding it difficult to calm down (‚ÄúEmotion Dysregulation‚Äù); unstable sense of self (due to the intense emotionality, PBPDs have a hard time knowing who they are or what they like and dislike) as well as strong feelings of emptiness ( ‚ÄúIdentity Dysregulation‚Äù);impulsivity, drug use, promiscuity, binge-eating or shopping due to the intense emotions and feelings of emptiness; self-destructive behaviors such as sabotaging close relationships or even self-harm (the self destructive behaviors are called ‚ÄúBehavioral Dysregulation‚Äù); difficulty to admit fault and ‚Äúprojection‚Äù of fault to others; disassociation from reality under stress (and/or hallucinations) as well as incorrect perception of reality (‚Äúdelusions‚Äù) (called ‚ÄúCognitive Dysregulation‚Äù) ; and ultimately an extremely high rate of suicide (up to 70% of PBPDs will attempt suicide and 1 in 10 will commit suicide). BPD can range from Mild (people with Mild BPD are considered ‚Äúhigh-functioning‚Äù) to Severe (people with Severe BPD have trouble functioning, i.e. holding doing a job, taking care of themselves etc.). Not all PBPDs exhibit the same symptoms and in fact, there is great variation of how BPD manifests in different people. BPD is a serious and dangerous condition and one of the four ‚ÄúCluster B‚Äù Personality Disorders(Antisocial, Narcissistic, Borderline, and Histrionic) that are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behavior. It is imperative that PBPDs receive professional treatment. Unfortunately, many psychologists appear to lack to skills to properly diagnose BPD and it is often misdiagnosed or even left undiagnosed. To make matters worse, because of Interpersonal Dysregulation (PBPDs will hate those they trust and depend on), PBPDs have a reputation of being notoriously difficult patients and many psychologists outright refuse to treat them, so it can be difficult to find a treating psychologist. Besides Dialectical Behavior Therapywhich is absolutely necessary, it is said that yoga, meditation and breath-work can help manage the intensity of the BPD emotions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‚Äì5) lists 9 easy to spot BPD behaviors. A psychologist will diagnose someone with BPD if at least 5 of those 9 behaviors are spotted. Laypersons should not use the DSM-5 in attempting to understand BPD; it is a tool for professionals used for the limited purpose of diagnosis and NOT a full description of BPD. Furthermore, there have been several recommendations in updating the DSM in regards to BPD based on our updated understanding of BPD. It is also important for the loved ones and former loved ones of PBPDs to seek help for themselves. The trauma of suddenly being treated in a horrible way by a loved one and losing them for no apparent reason often causes PTSD and/or other mental health issues. For this reason, people who have been through a relationship with a PBPD are often called BPD survivors. Once someone is aware of what BPD is, it is relative easy to spot due to the intensity of the interpersonal relationships and the sudden devaluations that follow. It is through these interpersonal relationships that high functioning PBPDs often realize that a problem exists.

When did the biggest mass extinction occur?
The biggest, worst mass extinction which had taken place on Earth is the ‚Äò‚ÄôPermian-Triassic Mass Extinction event.‚Äô‚Äô It is also called ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Great Dying‚Äô‚Äô due to its severity. This happened around 252 Million years ago, around the Permian-Triassic boundary. This extinction event wiped out nearly 81% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial species by then. Some estimates put this at up to 95% of all species around that time. Comparatively, the K-T Event which wiped out dinosaurs had a fatality rate of around 70%. This was believed to be caused by massive volcanic activity, like Siberian Lava traps. Only the toughest and most adaptable species survived this event, driving many successful creatures of the Paleozoic like gorgonopsids, meganisopterans, and such to extinction.

What's the most interesting little known true crime case you can think of?
I‚Äôm going to tell you about Europe‚Äôs most notorious criminal - no, that‚Äôs underselling it: Europe‚Äôs most notorious serial killer that you‚Äôve never heard about. What makes this story even more perplexing is that the serial killer was female - something almost unheard of as these are extremely rare. It all started in 2007, with the murder of a 22-year-old policewoman, named Michele Kiesewetter in Heilbronn, Germany. Kiesewetter and a colleague were attacked - her colleague was shot in the head, but survived. Kiesewetter was not so lucky. As with most police killings, this attracted considerable attention across Germany - the Heilbronn police themselves racked up over 16,000 hours investigating. As you‚Äôd expect from modern police, the cops took DNA on cotton swabs and sent it out to be analysed. This is when things took a startling turn: the results were linked to numerous cold cases - including a murder that had been dated back in 1993! In total, cops linked this woman - an Eastern European woman, as the DNA suggested - to 6 other murders. But that wasn‚Äôt all - this mysterious woman - this serial killer - this cop killer - was also attached to many robberies, including a car-dealership and a school break-in. The people who had been convicted of these robberies claimed that she never existed, despite all of the DNA evidence suggesting otherwise. Maybe this woman was some Professor Moriarty type - the foil of the great Sherlock Holmes - and was a criminal mastermind! (Sherlock Holmes & Professor Moriarty) As with most bizarre cases and news agencies, she was given a catchy name: the Phantom of Heilbronn. As the investigations kept ramping up over the following months, the Professor Moriarty analogy became seemingly more likely, because her DNA was popping up outside of Germany! Her DNA was found on crime scenes in Austria and France - it seemed she associated with Slovaks, Albanians, Serbs, and Romanians - among others across Eastern Europe. The Phantom had never been seen. She never showed up on any security camera footage, despite the fact that her DNA at the scenes suggested otherwise. Anyone that did witness her described her as looking like a man. For years and years and years German authorities hunted for this elusive thief and serial killer. Until 2009, when they finally caught a break: when trying to establish the identity of a burned body and through DNA research, they discovered that it matched! Had they finally caught the Phantom of Heilbronn? Only. The dead body was discovered in 2002 (7 years before). And it was a man. Odd, they police thought ‚Äî understandably. The DNA had come from an asylum seeker, who had to be fingerprinted years earlier as part of the asylum seeking process. They went back to redo the test, just using a different cotton swab and ‚Äî nope, no DNA from the Phantom. So, they went back to the source: the factory that produced the cotton swabs themselves; Greiner Bio-One International AG. And that‚Äôs when they realised exactly what was happening. There was a reason why the Phantom of Heilbronn was so elusive, why nobody had seen her, why she never showed up on security cam footage: She never existed Here‚Äôs what actually happened: There was one factory that produced all of the cotton swabs involved in all of these crimes - while they were sterile, they were never designed for human DNA collection. It turned out that the factory employed mostly women - Eastern European women, to be exact - who all fit the DNA type assumed to fit the Phantom. It turned out that all the swabs had been contaminated before shipping. After thousands of hours of work by the police was wasted and 40 criminal investigations brought back to square one, the German police were at least able to take some solace from the fact that there was, really, no female serial killer. And that is some solace, right? And what of Mich√®le Kiesewetter, whose murder started all of this? In 2011, a Neo-Nazi group, named the National Socialist Underground, committed a bank robbery. When investigating, police discovered Uwe Mundlos and Uwe B√∂hnhardt; two of the three Neo-Nazis, dead in a burning caravan. It is suspected that they ended their lives after their vehicles had been discovered. In that caravan, the police also discovered the service pistol of murdered police woman. Now with leads, police then investigated the flat the trio shared together, where they found and arrested the last surviving member: Beate Zsch√§pe. Forensic experts also discovered further evidence to suggest that this trio were, in fact, responsible for the killing of Kiesewetter. Alongside this, they were also responsible for a series of murders of nine immigrants of Turkish, Greek and Kurdish descent between 9 September 2000 and 6 April 2006; a 1999 bombing in Nuremberg; the 2001 and 2004 Cologne bombings; and a series of 14 bank robberies. Had the trio‚Äôs vehicles never been discovered and they had never committed suicide, then authorities would never have known of their existence. And there you go - the story of Germany‚Äôs, nay, Europe‚Äôs most notorious and elusive serial killer & criminal mastermind ‚Äî who never existed at all.

Who is the most corrupt and crooked scientist ever known?
Probably the most famous corrupt scientist is Andrew Wakefield. Wakefield was (past tense emphasised) a gastroenterologist and biomedical researcher. He gained international fame when, in 1998, he published a paper in The Lancet which established (or at least, claimed to establish) a link between the MMR vaccine, and a rise in bowel disease and autism (interestingly ‚Äî only 12 children were in the study, and eight of them supposedly developed behavioural disorders. That‚Äôs an insanely small test group, and an absurdly high rate: if this data were true, over 20 million people would have been made autistic by MMR before 1998) We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers Yep ‚Äî this guy is the origin of the modern anti-vaccination movement (‚Äúantivaxxers‚Äù). Though the paper itself does not concretely blame MMR for the autism cases, Wakefield himself did several press conferences where he publicly claimed a causal link. This caused an uproar in the scientific community ‚Äî and was labelled as ‚Äúscience by press conference‚Äù. It was these press conferences (not the actual paper itself, though people used the paper as a post-hoc justification) that led to a huge resurgence of the anti-vaccination movement, and the outcry over vaccination of children. Information then slowly began to leak out that all was not as it seemed to be with the paper, either. Several of the families in the study were approached by a lawyer preparing a lawsuit against the firms making the MMR jab. Huh‚Ä¶that would seem to be a conflict of interest, right? That is pretty dodgy. Then it was revealed that said lawyers had paid Wakefield more than ¬£400,000 ($700,000), which he had failed to disclose. This seriously raised questions about Wakefield‚Äôs motives: how can you expect a paper published by somebody funded by people suing the MMR vaccine makers to be impartial about the MMR vaccine? In light of the conflict of interest this represented, The Lancet re-reviewed the paper, and found that it no longer satisfied them as a piece of genuine research ‚Äî and they issued to following retraction: We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between (the) vaccine and autism, as the data were insufficient. However the possibility of such a link was raised, and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent. Then, in 2004 it was revealed that, prior to publishing the 1998 paper, Wakefield had applied for a patent for a replacement for the MMR vaccine a mere few months before he began the 1998 paper which supposedly showed that the vaccine was unsafe! No way that could possibly have influenced his conclusions in the paper, right? Oh ‚Äî you think that‚Äôs it? No, this story just keeps on going! After this, a former student came forward and said that Wakefield routinely ignored laboratory data. All this while, independent studies were utterly failing to reproduce the original results , and several of them called into question Wakefield‚Äôs research methods. In 2007, the UK General Medical Council initiated proceedings against Wakefield on the charges of : * ""Was being paid to conduct the study by solicitors representing parents who believed their children had been harmed by MMR"". * Ordered investigations ""without the requisite paediatric qualifications"" including colonoscopies, colon biopsies and lumbar punctures (""spinal taps"") on his research subjects without the approval of his department's ethics board and contrary to the children's clinical interests, when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children's symptoms or medical history. * ""Act[ed] 'dishonestly and irresponsibly' in failing to disclose ... how patients were recruited for the study"". * ""Conduct[ed] the study on a basis not approved by the hospital's ethics committee."" * Purchased blood samples‚Äîfor ¬£5 each‚Äîfrom children present at his son's birthday party, which Wakefield joked about in a later presentation. * ""[S]howed callous disregard for any distress or pain the children might suffer The GMC ruled in favour of all charges ‚Äî and Wakefield was struck from the register (the harshest thing the GMC is able to do). During this trial Brian Deer (who had previously worked to uncover many of the inconsistencies in Wakefield‚Äôs work), discovered evidence that not only had there been poor lab practices, but that data had been willfully manipulated ‚Äî and highlighted the difference between the hospital records of the 1998 data, and the data published in the paper, which appeared to show significant manipulation. OH MY GOD THERE‚ÄôS STILL MORE THEN it was revealed that the father of one of the children in the 1998 study owned a patent that would profit from the MMR/autism scare , and that Wakefield himself predicted that they could ‚Äúmake more than $43 million a year from diagnostic kits‚Äù , where ‚Äúthe initial market for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing of patients with AE [autistic enterocolitis, an unproven condition concocted by Wakefield]‚Äù. In light of this, The Lancet then re-retracted the initial paper ‚Äî rather than just the edited conclusion I quoted above, they said: ""The claims in the original paper that children were 'consecutively referred' and that investigations were 'approved' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false."" This was followed by a flurry of other retractions of Wakefield‚Äôs papers ‚Äî many of which sought to establish a link between vaccination and illnesses. Seems like a happy ending, no? He got his comeuppance ‚Äî and the community has rejected his ideas after a rigorous peer review process. Exactly how science is meant to work, right? Whilst the scientific community was busy giving Wakefield‚Äôs 1998 report a jolly good rogering ‚Äî there was a human cost. You see, the everyday population doesn‚Äôt really pay attention to the proceeds of the UKGMC ‚Äî and nor do they study the retractions in medical journals. But when a man in a lab coat stands up and says ‚ÄúVACCINES CAUSE AUTISM!‚Äù ‚Äî that, they pay attention to. Since 1998, there has been a huge rise in the so called ‚Äúantivaxxer‚Äù movement ‚Äî who believe the claims of Wakefield . Several famous people have come out in support of the movement, including Jenny McCarthy (I‚Äôm not even going to cite this), and Jim Carrey , to name just two. This scare has led to huge numbers of children to be going unvaccinated, which compromises herd immunity , and has led to a staggering number of children to die from diseases they would have been safe from had they been vaccinated. I can‚Äôt 100% vouch for the methods of this website (though they certainly have a lot of primary sources from the CDC , which is promising), which has a running count of the number of preventable illnesses (in the US) and preventable deaths caused by non-vaccination. The current total stands at 152,763 preventable illnesses, and 9028 deaths. Let‚Äôs just repeat that. 9028 people have died (mostly children) because of the antivaccination movement. That website also contains a helpful counter for the ‚Äúnumber of autism diagnoses linked to vaccination‚Äù. Guess what that number stands at? 0. Zero. Nada. Zilch. Normally I would avoid making potentially libellous statements such as this ‚Äî but given that I have extensive back-up sources, citations ‚Äî and also the fact that this has been tested in court several times (Wakefield has never won a libel suit), I therefore feel pretty darned confident in asserting: Andrew Wakefield is the most corrupt scientist in history. He can be held accountable for the deaths of nearly 10,000 human beings, because of his fraudulent and unethical research. He did this out of a desire to make a profit ‚Äî and in doing so he compromised everything a scientist, and indeed a human being, should stand for. Sue me. I dare you.

What was socially acceptable in Roman times but would be horrifying today?
Most things in Rome would be horrifying for us. The real question would be what Roman tradition would be acceptable for us. Here are some examples Romans that would be unacceptable for us. BRUTAL EXECUTIONS Death penalty exists in our society. It is not widespread, but it exists. It is likely that you will find people that support death penalty even in countries where death penalty is illegal. However no one would allow these type of executions anywhere that were very common in Rome. Crucifixion was used for rebels, pirates and enemies of the state. In modern world, it would be either firing squad or hanging, but those are quick deaths. Interesting thing is most people are calm before hanging, while people often cry in despair before firing squad. However, no one could stand getting nailed to the cross and then spend entire day on the burning sun before finally getting suffocated. The best example of crucifixion is Jesus Christ, but other then significance of the act, it was not very gruesome. The worst crucifixion was in the year 70 BC when Crassus captured 6000 slaves. Senate declared that all of them should be crucified along the road from Sicily to Rome. Just imagine the horrible sight and keep in mind that Medieval men would be horrified to even think of doing that (e.g. Ottoman army reaction to Vlad the Impaler). That wasn‚Äôt the only unnecessarily brutal punishment. There was a legend that Vestal Virigin call Tarpeia betrayed Romans to Sabieans. She was betrayed by those same Sabieans and was burried under the tall rock that was knoen as Tarpeian Rock. That place would become a tradition and synonym for the capital punishment. This was reserved for the enemies of the state, but this is a vague term. During Sulla‚Äôs rule, citizens who found their names on the list, would get one way trip to the Tarpeian Rock. It was essentially a Guillotine that killed people en masse. Those times were so bad, that generation that survived that would have trauma of Sulla‚Äôs reign and people that were associated with him would be seen as brutes and murderers like Pompey. And finally, there was a decimation which was a military punishment reserved for mutinous legions. Soldier in group of 10 would pull a stick and the one with the shortest stick would be decimated, meaning he would be beaten to death by other 9 soldiers. Since most soldiers were friends and beating someone to death isn‚Äôt easy unless you are a psychopath, they were forced to do that. Anyone who show any restrain would be decimated too. I believe no modern army would ever dare to do something similar. ETHNIC CLEANSING All Empires are forged trough war. There were some who were more brutal then others, but overall violence is the norm. However, most armies conquered and settled next to their new subjects so they can control them better. That wasn‚Äôt always the case for Romans. While Pontic conquest of Anatolia is considered the first ethnic cleansing in history, it is hardly correct, as Romans were doing it more extensively around 150 years ago. Northern Italy around Po river was called Cisalpine Gaul. It was a home of Celts who lived there for centuries. With the growth of Rome, the conquest of Italy and victory of First Punic War, Rome focused on the north. Romans started aggressively settling in the Ciselpine Gaul, even if it directly harms Celts. As it was predicted Celtic tribes rebelled and united in order to fight Rome, but they were defeated in Telamon. When Hannibal arrived, many Celts joined him and were his great supporters against Rome, fighting Romans even at Zama simply because they felt Rome was an existential treat. After defeat of Hannibal, all Celts were either killed or forced to migrate over the Alps into the modern Bavaria and Czechia. When confederation under Helveti tried to migrate into Gaul running away from Germanic tribes, Caesar killed them. As for Julius Caesar, his Gallic Wars can be only summarized as genocide. Many tribes were wiped out from existence. There was an event where Belgii tribes under Ambiorix started to rebel since Roman protection from German tribes started to look and feel more like a permanent occupation. The revolt failed and Ambiorix was cornered repeating his final words over and over again: I am a free man, living in a free world. It is estimated that that around 3 million died in war mostly trough famine, but sizable number was enslaved (1 million according to Caesar). To my knowledge, no one made genocide and boosted about it as much as Romans. Alexander the Great is the closest thing that comes to that level of barbarity, but that‚Äôs reign of only one man and many people who wanted to criticize him always mentioned what he did in cities like Thebes, Tyre and Persopolis. Romans were different as in that was their state policy. Thracians and Dacians experienced similar fate and to some extend Phonicians (Carthage) and Greeks (Corinth) too. To make a comparison to modern time, Nazi Germany killed around 16 million people as part of their regime and this is the biggest counter-argument against Nazism and Fascism. POLITICAL VIOLENCE It is no surprise that most politicians are overall bad people. Most of them are corrupt, manipulative, greedy and ego-maniacs (I would also add sociopaths), but with all that said they are still more honest and respectful then Roman politicians. At very least in most countries politicians who have personal armed gangs quickly lose public favor and with it power unless their gang is a very loyal and heavily armed army. For Romans this was acceptable and in a way part of the system. While Rome had Plebeian Council, the real power was in the hand of the Senate. Most Senators had to prove themselves on the field of battle and in a way, Senate was directly in charge of the army. This seemingly minor detail is in fact of crucial importance. As Rome expanded further, more people lay in poverty as their property was deteriorating and since most of them were veterans, they were violent and knew how to fight. Many Senators used that to their advantage to intimidate their opponents. By the time of the late Republic when Rome adopted reforms of Gaius Marius, Senator without army is like a lion without teeth. Street violence was common, starting from Gracchi brothers all the way to Octavian. Many Senators even joined the violent clashes themselves, like they did in 133 BC. when Senators took up clubs and beaten to death Tribune of the Plebs Tiberius Gracchus. This was only the beginning. Sulla after marching on Rome with an army, established himself as Dictator for life and put on proscription where anyone who found himself on the list would be a wanted target and his property confiscated. This made entire generation of thieves, murderers and thugs a billionaires like Pompey, Lepidus, Crassus just to name a few. During the time of Catiline conspiracy, there were swords and daggers in the building of Senate itself. The fact that Senators thought that killing Caesar themselves publicly would be a good idea speaks volume on how violent the politics were. Needless to say that in those fights Plebeians were a collateral damage. While it may seem that during Principate era politics became calmer, the reality was the very opposite. It is true that in most cases ordinary people stayed out of the conflict, but fight for power was as violent as ever. Remember that in those times there were Praetorian Guards, who were suppose to protect Princeps while in reality they were a kingmakers and it was Germanic Guard that protected Princeps from them. Still, Plebeians could and did suffer. Caracalla killed some citizens of Alexandria who made a satirical play about murder of his brother. Once Military Anarchy in 3th century started, it was the Roman army lead by Roman Barrack-Emperors that butchered their own people. It is nearly impossible to find any modern regime with so much political violence that is widely accepted and almost institutionalized. Even totalitarian regime deny it or at very least neglect how violent they are. SLAVERY When people talk about Rome, they often forget Rome was above all else a slave-based empire. Slavery was heavily integrated into the Roman state that Constantine‚Äôs land reforms where slavery was almost banned, can serve as the beginning of Byzantine era. Slavery in Antiquity was also very common. Nearly all civilizations had it from Persians and Greeks to Celts and Scythians. However, Roman slavery was very widespread and very brutal. It is important to note that while slavery was consistent throughout Roman history, the status of a slave varied greatly. For example, we have found archeological evidence of slaves having proper burial in Kingdom age and slave status had improved greatly in Dominate age. However the status of slaves in between those times was horrible and probably the worst one up until Atlantic Slave trade. The official definition of Roman slave was a talking tool. Legally, there was no difference between a slave and a shovel. Already slaves had worse status then other neighboring nations, for example both Celts and Greeks acknowledged that slaves were in fact humans. With that definition comes everything else. One can become slave usually trough war, but also as a way of repaying debt. Loan shark was very common in Rome and many thugs became rich by exploiting the Plebs, especially the Proletarii even tough many laws were made to counter that specific act. It would always be disguised as ‚Äúwillingly‚Äù giving your own labor, but it is obvious that was a farce and no one seemed to care. Another way to become slave was to be prisoner of war or being sold by pirates. In that case, you are almost certainly doomed to die as a slave, assuming you survive to be sold because conditions in which slaves were kept were often horrible. Slavery trough warfare made Romans incredible rich and while it may seem horrible for us, it was a perfectly normal for a veteran to be a slaver. It is uncertain what wars brought the most slaves to Rome, but it can be easily seen that fall of Carthage and conquest of Gaul gave Romans incredible boost. Your life as a slave can weary. It is true that Romans weren‚Äôt racist (to be fair slavery based on racism exists only in Americas), but they did look into your nationality. It is hard to give a proper statistic, but from what I gathered certain slaves had more value then others. For example, Greek slaves were often very valued as they were considered smart and educated so they were used as tutors. In that case you will probably have nice and comfortable life for a slave. This is why there were many hellenophiles among Roman elites and why some of them had certain biases characterized for Greeks (e.g. Jews are traitorous religious fanatics). On the other hand, it seems many Thracian and Celtic slaves were used for brute force such as gladiator fights or if you are incredibly unlucky, as a farmer of some landlord or ship rower. If you happen to be locked in some mine, rest assured that you are never going to see the light of day. Keep in mind that your life is worth less then nothing. If you need assuring, remember what Crassus and Pompey did after defeating Spartacus. Slave could be freed, but even when he is freed there was an entire system of patronage and he immediately became Proletarii, meaning the only thing he had now is his freedom. That means that social mobility is possible, but the all odds are stuck against you. There is reason why Christianity was popular among slaves and the poor, because it gave them something no other religion did and that is compassion and hope for the better future be it in this life, or the afterlife. But slavery wasn‚Äôt only affecting slaves, but also Plebeians. This was one of the key problems in late Republic where Roman slaves took all the jobs from Plebeians leaving Rome overcrowded with impoverished peasants who had nothing, except their freedom and work (Proletarii). All those slaves worked for Patricians who took all the profit and nearly ran the entire Republic to the ground. So in essence, slaves were pure profit for the rich, but burden to everyone else, including the system itself. It should be also noted that Roman usage of slaves nearly stupefied them and stopped them from innovating as every problem they had was fixed by trowing slaves, until that problem hopefully disappeared. We can start talking about real Roman innovations only in Dominate times and Byzantine era when Rome became more feudal. So while Roman slavery wasn‚Äôt as bad as Spartan slavery, it was still as bad as it could get. Many Byzantine historians would condemn slavery of their ancestors as the result of evil and selfishness. Anyone who condemns slavery of Sugar islands or Nazi regimes should condemn Roman slavery as well because they were on the same level of brutality.

also known as The Babysitter and The Oakland County Child Killer, is an unidentified serial killer and rapist responsible for the murders of at least four children in Oakland County, Michigan.
Mark Stebbins Murder
On February 15, 1976, 12-year-old Mark Stebbins was seen leaving American Legion Hall. He had told his mother that he was going home to watch TV. He disappeared and turned up dead on February 19. His body was neatly laid out in a snowbank in the parking lot of an office building. Stebbins had been sexually assaulted with an object and strangled to death. Also, two cuts were inflicted to the left rear of his head, and rope marks were present on both his wrists and ankles, meaning that he had been tied up while in captivity. He was fully clothed, wearing the same outfit when he had vanished.
Jill Robinson Murder
12-year-old Jill Robinson packed her backpack and ran away from home after having an argument with her mother over dinner preparations on December 22. The next day, her bicycle was found behind a hobby store. On December 26, her body was discovered along the side of Interstate 75 near Big Beaver Road. Half of her face had been blown off by a 12-gauge shotgun while lying face up in the position that she was found in. Robinson was fully clothed and still wearing her backpack. Her body, neatly laid out in the snow, had been placed within sight of a police station.
Kristine Mihelich Murder
On January 2, 1977, 10-year-old Kristine Mihelich was last seen purchasing a magazine at a 7-Eleven store; her mother reported her as a missing person three hours later. On January 21, her fully clothed body was discovered by a mail carrier on the side of a rural road in Franklin Village. She was placed within view of nearby homes in the snow, eyes closed and arms folded across her chest. An autopsy revealed that Mihelich had been fatally smothered less than 24 hours before she was found.
Timothy King Murder
After borrowing money from his older sister so that he could buy candy at a nearby drugstore, 11-year-old Timothy King left his home with his skateboard on March 16. He exited the store by its rear entrance, which opened to a parking lot shared with a supermarket, and vanished. There was a widespread search, and in a tragic TV appeal, his father begged for his son to be released. In a letter printed to Detroit News, King's mother wrote that she hoped he would come back home so she could serve him his favorite meal, Kentucky Fried Chicken. On March 22, two teenagers noticed his body in a shallow ditch. His skateboard was next to him, and his clothing was neatly pressed and washed. He had been sexually assaulted with an object and suffocated to death. The autopsy revealed that King was murdered six hours before he was found; he had also been fed KFC prior to his death.
__
The M.O. of the Babysitter mainly consisted of abducting children while they were on their way to specific locations before holding them captive for four to nineteen days, sexually assaulting (boys only) and murdering them in various ways, such as shooting them with a shotgun (which the killer only implemented once) or asphyxiation by smothering them.
__
Known Victims
1976:
February 15: Mark Stebbins, 12 years old
December 22: Jill Robinson, 12 years old
1977:
January 2: Kristine Mihelich, 10 years old
March 16: Timothy King, 11 years old
Final thoughts:
Honestly this case makes me so sick like I actually had a hard time while researching this, It‚Äôs sickening to know we share a world with people like this. Plus he was never caught which Is even more sickening that this person was able to walk free after doing this to these poor kids. I didn‚Äôt find any solid proof about a suspect so I won‚Äôt be putting one here.

If someone would kidnap you and keep you in a room and heard voices, what type of personality disorder would they have?
Uhm, no personality disorder that sounds more like psychosis. Did you mean the voices told them to lock you in there? And if they were to have a personality disorder, it would most likely be antisocial personality disorder if the antisocial behavior has been there since childhood.

Would a psychologist spot it if someone had schizotypal personality disorder?
Yes, I think they would. Depending on who they are and how they see STPD. If you would DM me, I would like to know more about this question. :)

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Let her see one, You‚Äôre not her. You do not know what she Is feeling. Plus, she‚Äôs 18 she‚Äôs allowed to do whatever she wants. Please don‚Äôt be that parent that pushes everything away, that will only hurt you in long run.

Ofc they can, it‚Äôs not something they should do because who wants to live alone that seems depressing. But if they wanted to they could. As long as they are being treated and are not aggressive.

For me the zodiac killer case hits home because I am around the same area where the murders took place. Let‚Äôs begin.
The zodiac killer was an unidentified serial killer. That was around in the late 1960s, As the wiki said ‚ÄúThe case has been described as the most famous unsolved murder case in American history‚Äù
The zodiac killer killed 5 but claimed to have killed 37.
Lake Herman Road murders:
The first murders widely attributed to the Zodiac Killer were the shootings of high school students Betty Lou Jensen and David Arthur Faraday on December 20, 1968, on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits. The couple were on their first date and planned to attend a Christmas concert at Hogan High School, about three blocks from Jensen's home. They instead visited a friend before stopping at a local restaurant and then driving out on Lake Herman Road. At about 10:15 p.m., Faraday parked his mother's Rambler in a gravel turnout, which was a well-known lovers' lane. Shortly after 11:00 p.m., their bodies were found by Stella Borges, who lived nearby. The Solano County Sheriff's Department investigated the crime, but no leads developed.
Blue Rock Springs murder:
Just before midnight on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau drove into the Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four miles (6.4 km) from the Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into the lot and parked alongside them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching the passenger side door of Ferrin's car, carrying a flashlight and a 9 mm Luger. The killer directed the flashlight into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer walked away from the car but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.
On July 5, 1969, at 12:40 a.m., a man phoned the Vallejo Police Department to report and claim responsibility for the attack. The caller also took credit for the murders of Jensen and Faraday six and a half months earlier. Police traced the call to a phone booth at a gas station at Springs Road and Tuolumne, located about three-tenths of a mile (500 m) from Ferrin's home and only a few blocks from the Vallejo Police Department. Ferrin was pronounced dead at the hospital. Mageau survived the attack despite being shot in the face, neck and chest. Mageau described his attacker as a 26-to-30-year-old, 195-to-200-pound (88 to 91 kg) or possibly even more, 5-foot-8-inch (1.73 m) white male with short, light brown curly hair.
First letters from the Zodiac:
On August 1, 1969, three letters prepared by the killer were received at the Vallejo Times Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle, and The San Francisco Examiner. The nearly identical letters, subsequently described by a psychiatrist to have been written by ""someone you would expect to be brooding and isolated"", took credit for the shootings at Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs. Each letter also included one-third of a 408-symbol cryptogram which the killer claimed contained his identity. The killer demanded they be printed on each paper's front page, or he would ""cruse around all weekend killing lone people in the night then move on to kill again, until I end up with a dozen people over the weekend"". The Chronicle published its third of the cryptogram on page four of the next day's edition. An article printed alongside the code quoted Vallejo Police Chief Jack E. Stiltz as saying ""We're not satisfied that the letter was written by the murderer"" and requested the writer send a second letter with more facts to prove his identity. The threatened murders did not happen, and all three parts were eventually published.
On August 7, 1969, another letter was received at The San Francisco Examiner with the salutation ""Dear Editor This is the Zodiac speaking."" This was the first time the killer had used this name for identification. The letter was a response to Chief Stiltz's request for more details that would prove he had killed Faraday, Jensen and Ferrin. In it, the Zodiac included details about the murders that had not yet been released to the public, as well as a message to the police that when they cracked his code ""they will have me"".
On August 8, 1969, Donald and Bettye Harden of Salinas, California cracked the 408-symbol cryptogram. It contained a misspelled message in which the killer seemed to reference ""The Most Dangerous Game"". The author also said that he was collecting slaves for his afterlife. No name appears in this decoded text, and the killer said that he would not give away his identity because it would slow down or stop his slave collection.
(""I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forrest because man is the most dangeroue anamal of all to kill something gives me the most thrilling experence it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl the best part of it is thae when I die I will be reborn in paradice and all the I have killed will become my slaves I will not give you my name because you will try to sloi down or atop my collectiog of slaves for my afterlife ebeorietemethhpiti""
‚ÄîThe solution to Zodiac's 408-symbol cipher, solved in August 1969, including faithful transliterations of spelling and grammar errors in the original. The meaning, if any, of the final eighteen letters has not been determined.)
Lake Berryessa murder:
On September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. A white man, about 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) weighing more than 170 pounds (77 kg), approached them wearing a black executioner's-type hood with clip-on sunglasses over the eyeholes and a bib-like device on his chest that had a white three-by-three-inch (7.6 cm √ó 7.6 cm) cross-circle symbol on it. He approached them with a gun, which Hartnell believed to be a .45. The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from a jail with a two-word name, in either Colorado or Montana (a police officer later inferred that the man had been referring to a jail in Deer Lodge, Montana), where he had killed a guard and subsequently stolen a car, explaining that he now needed their car and money to travel to Mexico because the vehicle that he had been driving was ""too hot"". The killer had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell before he tied her up. The killer checked, and tightened Hartnell's bonds after discovering that Shepard had bound Hartnell's hands loosely. Hartnell initially believed this event to be a bizarre robbery, but the man drew a knife and stabbed them both repeatedly, Hartnell suffering six and Shepard ten wounds in the process. The killer then hiked 500 yards (460 m) back up to Knoxville Road, drew the cross-circle symbol on Hartnell's car door with a black felt-tip pen, and wrote beneath it:
(‚ÄúVallejo

Presidio Heights murder:
Two weeks later, on October 11, 1969, a white male passenger entered the cab driven by Paul Stine at the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets (one block west from Union Square) in San Francisco, requesting to be driven to Washington and Maple Streets in Presidio Heights. For reasons unknown, Stine drove one block past Maple to Cherry Street. The passenger then shot Stine once in the head with a 9 mm handgun, took Stine's wallet and car keys, and tore away a section of Stine's bloodstained shirt tail. The perpetrator was observed by three teenagers across the street at 9:55 p.m., and they phoned the police while the crime was in progress. They observed a man wiping the cab down before walking away toward the Presidio, one block to the north. Two blocks from the crime scene, patrol officers Don Fouke and Eric Zelms, responding to the call, observed a white man walking along the sidewalk east on Jackson Street and stepping onto a stairway leading up to the front yard of one of the homes on the north side of the street; the encounter lasted only five to ten seconds. Fouke estimated the white male pedestrian to be 35 to 45 years old, 5'10"" tall with a crew cut, similar to but slightly older than the description provided by the teenagers who observed the killer in and out of Stine's cab. The teenagers described the suspect to be 25 to 30 years old with a crew cut and standing approximately 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) to 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) tall. However, the police radio dispatcher had alerted officers to look out for a black suspect, so Fouke and Zelms drove past the perpetrator without stopping; the mixup in descriptions remains unexplained. A search ensued, but no suspects were found. This was the last officially confirmed murder by the Zodiac Killer.
The Stine murder was initially believed to be a routine robbery that had escalated into homicidal violence. However, on October 13, the San Francisco Chronicle received a new letter from Zodiac that claimed credit for the killing and contained a torn section of Stine's bloody shirt to ""prove this"" fact. The three teen witnesses worked with a police artist to prepare a composite sketch of Stine's killer; a few days later, this police artist returned, working with the witnesses to prepare a second composite sketch. Detectives Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi were assigned to the case. The San Francisco Police Department investigated an estimated 2,500 suspects over a period of years
The letters:
Zodiac continued to communicate with authorities for the remainder of 1970 via letters and greeting cards to the press. In a letter postmarked April 20, 1970, the Zodiac wrote, ""My name is _____,"" followed by a 13-character cipher that hasn't been solved to this day. The Zodiac went on to state that he was not responsible for the recent bombing of a police station in San Francisco (referring to the February 18, 1970, death of Sgt. Brian McDonnell two days after the bombing at Park Station in Golden Gate Park) but added ""there is more glory to killing a cop than a cid because a cop can shoot back."" The letter included a diagram of a bomb the Zodiac claimed that he would use to blow up a school bus. At the bottom of the diagram, he wrote: "" (symbol)= 10, SFPD = 0.""
On October 27, 1970, Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (who had been covering the Zodiac case) received a Halloween card signed with a letter 'Z' and the Zodiac's crossed-circle symbol. Handwritten inside the card was the note ""Peek-a-boo, you are doomed."" The threat was taken seriously and was the subject of a front-page story in the Chronicle. Soon after receiving the letter, Avery received an anonymous letter alerting him to the similarities between the Zodiac's activities and the unsolved murder of Cheri Jo Bates, which had occurred four years earlier at the city college in Riverside in the Greater Los Angeles Area, more than 400 miles (640 km) south of San Francisco. Avery reported his findings in the Chronicle on November 16, 1970.
After the Lake Tahoe card, the Zodiac remained silent for nearly three years. The Chronicle then received a letter from the Zodiac, postmarked January 29, 1974, praising The Exorcist as ""the best saterical comidy that I have ever seen"". The letter included a snippet of verse from The Mikado and an unusual symbol at the bottom that has remained unexplained by researchers. Zodiac concluded the letter with a new score, ""Me = 37, SFPD = 0"".

The unidentified serial killer terrorized London in the late 1800s killing 5 women.
The serial killer typically killed female prostitutes, The throats of his victims were cut, And the insides were mutilated.
Murders:
Mary Ann Nichols - 31 August 1888
At 3:40 a.m. a person named ‚ÄúCharles Allen Lechmere‚Äù Spotted what he thought was a tarpaulin lying on the ground. In front of a gateway to buck's row, upon inspecting the object, Charles discovered the tarpaulin was actually the body of a woman. She had been dead for approximately 30 minutes.
Annie Chapman - 8 September 1888

Cadosch later informed police he had heard a woman say, ""No, no!"" before hearing the sound of something or someone falling against the fence dividing the back yards of numbers 27 and 29 Hanbury Street. Annie Chapman's mutilated body was discovered shortly before 6:00 a.m. by an elderly resident of 29 Hanbury Street named john davis.
Elizabeth Stride - 30 September 1888
Tride's body was discovered at approximately 1:00 a.m. on Sunday 30 September 1888 in the adjacent dutfield's yard by Louis Diemschutz, to avoid what appeared to be a bundle lying upon the ground. Noting what he later described as a ""dark object"" lying on the ground. Upon lighting a match, Diemschutz saw a prone body. He reported his discovery before the group promptly dispersed to seek help.
Catherine Eddowes - 30 September 1888
At 1:44 a.m., Eddowes's mutilated body was found lying on her back. Upon discovering Eddowes's body, Watkins called for assistance from the night watchman at the Kearley and Tonge warehouse which bordered Mitre Square: ex-policeman George James Morris. Morris had been sweeping the landings inside the warehouse. After viewing the body, he informed Watkins he had noted nothing unusual that evening. Another policeman to arrive in Mitre Square in response to Morris's whistle, PC Holland, immediately summoned local surgeon Dr. George William Sequeira to the scene. Sequeira arrived at the scene at 1:55 a.m. Within minutes, Dr. Frederick Gordon Brown had also arrived at the crime scene.
Mary Jane Kelly - 9 November 1888
Shortly after 10:45 a.m., Bowyer knocked on her door but received no response. He then attempted to turn the handle, only to discover the door was locked. Bowyer then looked through the keyhole, but could not see anybody in the room. The body was discovered around 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. She was lying on her bed she had been mutilated.
Motive:
The motive in this case is unclear. I would say the killer got some kind of sexual pleasure from killing these women, But the motive is still unclear therefore I can‚Äôt say for sure.
Possible diagnosis:
I personally believe jack the ripper suffered from a mental disorder. Here are the 2 I think he could have had.
Antisocial personality disorder.
Sexual sadism disorder.
Ending:
Thanks for reading have a nice day! :)

I get that, makes sense. I'm not big on drawing or artsy things in general but I've enjoyed making my own drawings etc for my home decorations. I don't mind the colouring books the kids have, quite enjoy colouring with them. But the absolute insanity of these teeny tiny extremely defined books just stress me out big time. Too many possibilities, at least when I just block colour a frog you don't feel like you can go too wrong üòÇ

I've never tried adhd specific medication but I have just come off quetiapine from misdiagnosis and I've definitely gotten louder. I keep being told how loud I am now, my mum thinks I'm going deaf ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not intentionally loud, deep down in my real self I'm a peaceful person. I just can't seem to control shouting when I intend to just talk normally

I used to be very intuitive with such things but I haven't been for a quite a while. I think it's because I have a family now so all my focus purely goes into them

I tried the antidepressants way before adhd was even considered for me, I knew other people did well on sertraline but it was just awful for myself. I have tried herbal sleep tablets, they work nicely. They don't get me to sleep much easier but the quality of the sleep they I get when I take them is greatly improved. They have hop stroblie, valerian and passion flower in. Of course though, speak to a pharmacist before taking any to make sure they won't cause any nasty interactions with other medicines x

I can't say for autism, but for adhd I would say I'm definitely nervous to every try ADs again, sertraline especially was horrible, it made me even more, ticky? Like I couldn't rest on it. I was constantly doing things tapping my fingers on surfaces and twitching my legs and I'm not usually like that very much despite adhd. Citalopram did not have these effects but I'm unsure if it ever actually helped me, so maybe try that one instead? Weed will definitely help with sleep and short term relaxation but the long term effects of it make anxiety much worse (and I say from experience). I've bought some CBD oil drops but haven't actually tried them yet.
For anxiety over all I don't have much of a suggestion, I'm horrendous for it and there's nothing you can say to someone or give them to improve it really. Hope not to sound silly but trying to find some inner calmness is the only way forward with it. Its kind of a ‚Äúyou can only truly help yourself‚Äù type thing. I plan to try yoga too when I get in a better rhythm, maybe you could do some of that with her? Breathing exercises and learning to control your breathing in a state of anxiety is a big winner. Sorry I'm probably not much help x

Listening isn't my only problem. I just wanted to know if anyone else did this. I definitely don't think it's an auditory issue, its a focus issue. And that internal loudness that nearly always seems to be around..

I haven't really had an issue with it with food. Need to try make sure I don't notice now üòÖ I first noticed it really badly at a seaside when I was a young teen.

Hurt even more that I would constantly get told by my teachers that I would fail and always got called a distraction. Which I've never understood because I always thought I was a good kid? I always did as I was told, I was too fearful to not.

it doesn‚Äôt matter if he was in prison or on a vacation for 18 months. It has nothing to do with prison and everything to do with the trust and honesty in your relationship. If he says he didn‚Äôt have sex, why don‚Äôt you believe him? If you fear sex was forced on him, why don‚Äôt you think he would tell you? What does it mean for your relationship if he had sex in prison- sex is an entirely different thing in prison than it is outside, are you able to accept that he may have used sex as a bargaining chip to find more safety? Or maybe he traded use of his body for necessities‚Ä¶ (necessities that should be provided by the prison but are not so people turn to desperate measures like offering their body).
I‚Äôve seen this question asked 500 times. I don‚Äôt say that to invalidate you.. people need to understand‚Ä¶ SEX ( especially Sex (especially in a men‚Äôs prison) IS A COMMODITY. is a commodity. When a human is afraid for their life, they will do uncharacteristic things. Are you capable of understanding that? Can your partner come to you and explain this to you? Will you be forgiving?
your partner may have had sex in prison. It could have been because he was threatened. Maybe he tried to sell himself for some safety. Maybe he was raped. Maybe he loved it because he is lonely and he can‚Äôt express any of these feelings to you because you take things personally and assume prison sex is a personal attack.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I am so angered by this question. Please, go see a therapist yourself so you can be a better parent. Everyone on the planet should be seeing a therapist regardless of their mental health state, It should be part of general hygiene. I‚Äôm not going to be sensitive to your feelings because your kid probably has some trauma related to your neglectful and uninformed parenting. If mental health was taken seriously by parents, teens and preteens and even children would be allowed to seek help without question and there would so much less suicide, self harm, finding drugs as a coping mechanism, eating disorders, and whatever other horrible things that young people start in their teens to cope when their families teach them that they can‚Äôt seek help from professionals or that something must be horri‚Ä¶

I truly appreciate that you shared this- it could not have been easy. It is a beautifully written love story. Grief is an effing monster- there is no pill to cure it. Time is the only healer but it‚Äôs also so painful to stop grieving, letting go felt wrong to me at first and wrapped me up in more grief. Just know that you‚Äôre not alone in this. She may not have consciously known that you were with her or who you were as she died, but she did know deep inside that she wasn‚Äôt alone and that she was loved- that is a great gift. I lost a partner a few years ago and I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it out alive, but I listened to a ton of Thich Nhat Hahn‚Äôs talks about life and grieving and they lifted me out of the darkness. I feel so much for you. Thank you for sharing.

I mean in the first episode I thought so too, but I kinda don‚Äôt like that. I feel like Maud is supposed to represent the stereotypical autistic individual and as a result she fails to accurately represent those of us on the autistic spectrum appropriately. I personally think that Twilight or Fluttershy are much better representations of autistic individuals.

Hey, I just wanted to validate your experience and to say that what happened to you was absolutely unforgivable and definitely that bad.

If I may, as a transwoman, I would like to respond to your utterly disrespectful and inappropriate comments and to anyone who may agree with you. I would like to tell you a story about someone. She grew up in a Christian cult as an assigned male at birth person or AMAB although she identified as a woman and she always thought from a young age that she would grow up to be a woman, just like all the women she admired and identified with. As time passed she dealt with ostracization and abuse from those around her because she was different and it took her 15 years to realize why. She bore the brunt of these attacks and isolation alone and never once lifted a finger in her defense and even if she had it would have gone very badly for her or completely unnoticed. As time went on her family left the cult but retained their ideology, still she was allowed to escape the narrowminded world she grew up in and to interact with the world and she flourished. She found and passionately pursued interests and pushed herself and all of this was done without any support. When she entered highschool she was finally exposed to people like her, people who didn‚Äôt identify with their assigned gender and people who loved others in ways beyond the traditional male-female dichotomy, and it was here that she entered into an identity crisis over something she had never fully resolved. She struggled with this crisis for nearly a year in silence before coming to a realization and then she was terrified to share it with others because she was afraid that she would be attacked, yet she also struggled with keeping it hidden because she believed in authenticity and in being authentic with those she considered family. When she shared her newfound truth with those she considered herself closest to, she was rejected. Her entire family united in tormenting her and she went on to endure that for another 6 years. During her time in finishing highschool she worked to find ways of avoiding the abuse and it‚Äôs honestly lucky that she ended up finding some. After she graduated she made her way to college to study engineering at a prestigious engineering college she was accepted to thanks to all the hard work she put in in highschool. There she struggled once again due to crippling depression and anxiety as well as supporting her family how she could, she still managed to do well in her classes as she was consistent her studying habits. She also managed to get involved in a couple of clubs and was very proactive in them. In the spring semester of her freshman year, her parents ended up getting a divorce and she stepped in to help the parent who along with one of her siblings was fleeing domestic violence from the other parent. Although this caused her to have to drop a class, she still passed the other classes she was taking that semester with good grades. Next she dealt with the rest of her family slowly turning against her, specifically from the parent who she‚Äôd sacrificed some of her academic progress in order to help them land on their feet after the divorce. During this time she ended up having to leave school and she also faced the beginnings of the Covid-19 pandemic. She spent that time recovering and healing and a semester after she left school she was getting ready to go back to school again, this time for physics as she‚Äôd lost her passion for engineering due to disillusionment of the field she hoped to join. Her plans were somewhat interrupted because she had to flee for her life, from the parent she‚Äôd aided, and ended up becoming homeless, but was thankfully able to end up in a shelter. 3 months later she was in school working to get her degree and working and three months after that she had her own apartment. If She is currently 21 and if you‚Äôre wondering where she is now, well now she‚Äôs taking the time to answer your post and tell you what a privileged dumb fuck you are. You claim that people within my community are weak and yet I doubt you have had to face even a fraction of what I chose to share with you and that is but a sliver of the glacier that I deal or have dealt with and many in my community can say the same. If we‚Äôre going to compare strengths here then on average myself and my community are lifting mountains and you, you‚Äôre to weak to pick up a toothpick. Next time I‚Äôd encourage you to actually do some research and try engaging in thoughtful discussion before opening your big dumb mouth to spout meaningless bullshit. Thankyou all for your time, this has been a Ted talk by Alliyah. Cheers and hope you have a wonderful day!

What are some good examples of ""life isn't fair""?
Hi, so I guess I‚Äôll start with my identities. I‚Äôm a poor, white, autistic, transwoman, lesbian, cult survivor, survivor of abuse, and formerly homeless person. Additionally, I‚Äôve had to cut off pretty much my entire family and the ones I still talk to; my mom and one of my siblings rely on me for support. Did I mention I‚Äôm just 21. I‚Äôve spent pretty much my entire life taking care of myself and my family while trying to pursue my goal of going to college for science. I used to go to the Colorado School of Mines and studied engineering but had to drop out because my mom needed my help surviving while dealing with my father, who is an objectively terrible person. Throughout my life, I‚Äôve had to fear for and plan for incidents in which my life was/would be in danger. I‚Äôm not going to get too‚Ä¶

I got a humiliating IQ score of 81 on my high school IQ test. Am I really that dumb? I usually spend my time reading non-fiction books, playing the violin, and solving problems.
So I've had a chance to look at some other people's answers and I wanted to give my own insight. My question for you is are you aware of where IQ tests come from? The tests were originally designed in France in 1904 by a guy named Alfred Binet to help identify struggling students. Binet isn't particularly important here because the guy we really want to look at is Lewis Terman. Terman was a Stanford psychologist who helped promote IQ testing in the US as a way to reinforce stereotypes about people of color, white ethnic groups, and poor people . Because of the incredibly racist views at the time, IQ tests were used as another tool to keep marginalized people in their place, and these tests haven't outgrown this as people continue to view them as a way of measuring the value of a person.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
While others have answered this in great ways already, I felt the need to add my two bits. I cannot stress enough that you should believe her and support her. Our mental health is an incredibly important part of our lives that is often disregarded, especially in the US. Now I might be making a bit of an assumption, but I presume that you also live in the US and so you and your family are all subjected to the incredibly harmful stereotypes and views of mental health that the US has. The reality is that the kinds of messages that she and you have been receiving wouldn‚Äôt make it implausible in the slightest that she might hide how she‚Äôs feeling. Additionally, we‚Äôve been going through some pretty insane things lately including a pandemic, the election, just general day to day life, and in many‚Ä¶

I have severe social anxiety and my parents are forcing me back to school, they said they‚Äôd get me therapy, but not until after I go back‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm terrified and feel like Ill kms because of going back (and other factors) ‚Ä¶ what should I do?
Hello! I'm so sorry you're experiencing this right now! I've had experiences similar to yours and I know how daunting and insurmountable situations like this can feel (I'm not going to say that I know exactly how you're feeling though because everyone experience things differently and I don't want to make this about myself). My advice to you would be to communicate how you're feeling with an adult (it sounds like you're a teenager?). Your parents need to understand that your need for help is urgent. You could ask them to set aside some time for you to talk to them about something important or write them a letter if that's easier. If telling your parents doesn't feel safe, there's always options. If you're part of a religious organization you can ask a religious leader. Or you can go find one‚Ä¶

(Note: I do mention suicide and self harm) Hello. So my mom was the same way. Part of it had to do with her ableism and the fact that she's against pharmaceutical companies. I don't know your opinions on those things, and I'm not going to assume; I just figured it was relevant enough to mention. I always have had problems in school but in sixth grade, I started feeling anxious in certain situations and I couldn't understand why. It continued to worsen to the point where some of my high school teachers spoke to my mother about in on my behalf to see what could be done to help me because it was severely impacting my school performance and my quality of life. My fear was that she wouldn't believe me. I was right. I did wind up with an IEP. I was often gaslight for things I couldn't control. The‚Ä¶

I have watched so many dramas about the main character stealing someone‚Äôs fiance. Is it really okay to do that in real life?
In real life you can't steal someone's fiance, rather your male or female doesn't matter either. If your partner can be ‚Äústolen"" then let them go. They were never really yours to begin with. If you truly love someone you will be faithful to them. Always remember you can't ‚Äúaccidentally cheat"" on someone. Cheating is not just the physical act of having sex with someone else. If you are giving your time and attention to another person, it can be considered cheating. If you're ever confused by what is considered cheating or not just ask yourself two questions. Would you be okay with your partner seeing the conversation you are having with this other person? Or If you seen this conversation between your partner and someone else would you be okay with it?

Where can I find a girlfriend that is a software engineer like me, at 31?
From here, Facebook Groups, Linkdin, Reddit and more have groups for software engineers.
The best relationships start as friends. Yes, I understand that most are not relationship sites. But, who knows, you might find one there. The whole point is to put yourself out there to meet new people.
Since you are a software engineer, how about designing an app? They have apps for relationship, dating ect.. I don't remember ever seeing one based on careers, so why not design one?
I think it would be amazing to have an app like that. There are a lot of careers that make it hard to date or find someone who understands your career demands.
I wish you the best of luck. I'd love to know if you actually do it.

What happens when an adult child moves back home? Is he pampered and treated like a child again, or does he have to abide by the rules and do chores?
My answer might be different than most. A little back story is my daughter moved out when she was 18, the exact day she turned 18. She always thought I was too strict. I raised them without their father (his choice). She moved to Texas shortly after to be around her Dad. My son continued to live with me. He worked and eventually his girlfriend moved in too. He's two years older than my daughter and I've known his girlfriend most of her life. They contributed to all the utility bills. If I cooked, they would clean if they were home or eating at home that night. Once a kid turns 18 they are responsible for what they do, not the parent anymore. As far as rules it was more of being considerate. If your not coming home to eat, tell me. If your going to be out late, text me so I don't have to worr‚Ä¶

I am curious if anyone has a question for a new Burn Book. Something you wished they would ask, but never do. I'm making several. One for divorce, one for an ex best friend and one for a family member who you had to cut from your life because they are toxic are the first 3 topics.
If you don't know what a burn book is: you write down all the things you wished you could say out loud, but couldn't. You write down everything and burn it. No one sees what you've wrote, but you. They help you bury all that hurt and negativity so you can move on.
I will be having several different Burn Books for different ages, as well as different issues we all face. Hopefully we can even have a Covid-19 burn book too, where it's finally gone and you can write down all the horrible things that happened during it.Then burn it!!
So, if you can tell me what questions you would like burn books to have, I'd really appreciate your input. If I use your question I will give you credit for it in the book.
Thank you!!!

How do I deal with my 19 year old daughter breaking off our relationship because I won't accept her relationship with a 13 year old?
Im not here to bash you or your daughter. What I am going to suggest is going to the boys parents and telling them everything you know. This will make your daughter angry, but since she won't listen, you need to be the responsible adult and go to this boys family. If they choose not to involve the law I would offer her counciling, and make it inpatient. She needs help. She can go to prison and she needs to know that. Maybe you can get the boys parents to give her an ultimatum. Turn her in and she will do time and have to register as a sex offender for life or go to inpatient facility to help her. I know this sounds dramatic, and it is. Hopefully you can do some counciling with her while she's there to repair y'all's relationship. I truly hope you do something to help her.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
When my daughter was 11 a doctor told me she was bipolar. I argued with this man and said it's just hormones. I told him if I felt like she had any issues I'd bring her back. What I need to explain is my son was diagnosed at a very young age with things I'd rather not say publicly, for his privacy. He was seen by a pediatric nuero- psychologist. He was kicked out of kindergarten 3 times because he was so hyper. This same doctor, that said my daughter was bipolar, swore my son would be in a group home by 15 and never be a part of society. We moved to a much smaller town and they got him a paraprofessional that helped tremendously. So by this time my kids and I were in counseling every day of the week. My daughter's councilor agreed that he didn't feel she needed any medication. (Yes my daught‚Ä¶

I got a girl pregnant by accident. She won‚Äôt abort it. What can I do to avoid paying for the child?
Even though I believe you should man up and take responsibility, I don't think your mature enough to do so. I am not trying to be mean at all. If you truly don't want anything to do with your child you can give up your parental rights. You should talk to the girl you got pregnant. See, it takes two people to make a baby and I don't think you can accidentally impregnate her. Certain things are deliberately put in certain places. There was no accident there. If you tried protection and it didn't work for some reason or another then you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. You didn't say someone made you have intercourse, so it would be fair to say you engaged in sexual intercourse willingly. I'm sure you've had some kind of sexual education and know how everything works. You know‚Ä¶

Is this legal? I just turned 18 and am unemployed. I am still in high school. My father told me I have to move out in the next week, because I‚Äôm no longer his responsibility. I have nowhere to go, and no job, what do I do?
I do not know where you are located, but if your still in highschool maybe this will help. Do you have a Job Corps near you? The ones around here in the south provide you a place to live, finish high school and help you start a career or career training. You will have to help out there, and of course there are rules. But, it's an option if you have no where else to go. There may be one in a near by state. Just Google Job Corps near me. Another option is the military. If your 18. Join the military and serve your country. When your done you have college paid for, a way to buy a house and of course you can make a career out of the military if it's something you like.

I just want you to know there are other solutions. Adoption is one of them. Do you have or know someone you trust to help out with your baby or would take custody? Remember adoption has changed. Now people are more willing to do an open adoption. This allows you certain privileges to your child after they adopt. You and the new parents figure out what works for all envolved.

I‚Äôm 15 and very pregnant. No one knows (not even mom) because I wear large clothes and I‚Äôm rather hefty. I don‚Äôt want this baby, can I have it at the hospital and leave without getting in trouble or mom knowing?
Are you willing to let someone else raise your child? Adoption is a wonderful selfless gift you can give to someone who can't have a child. They even have open adoption now where you can still be a part of the baby's life. Especially as you get older and wonder how she's doing, you'll be able to know. I'm here if you need someone just to talk to. I know it's hard, but you need someone to talk to. Maybe we can even talk about why you don't think your Mom would understand or maybe you need support to be able to talk. I'm here if you need someone.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Hello, as someone who went through this and has a mother who would refuse to believe her daughter just like you, I know exactly how your daughter probably feels. Maybe not exactly, as we all have different experiences, but it‚Äôs probably pretty close. I first started having mental health problems when I was about 14 or 15. I kept to myself mostly. I was the quiet kid in class but if I was with a friend, you couldn‚Äôt get me to close my mouth. (My French teacher had to actually separate my best friend and I because we would be constantly talking to each other and even after she separated us, we still found ways to talk.) I seemed happy, have parents who love and care for me, friends, what more could I ask for? But yet, I was dying emotionally on the inside. I would constantly tell myself that‚Ä¶

Just shut up. I always help everyone since I was 11, I‚Äôm 21 now, and what do I get from others? I got fired from my job because the boss‚Äô friend needed a job and he fit in ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù. I gave money to whoever asked me to give them some, what did I get? I needed 50 HUF ( ‚Ç¨0,14 ) to get on the bus and go home (about 120km) and NOBODY said ‚ÄúHey, there‚Äôs 50 huf!‚Äù, I had to sleep outside, alone, on a bench when it was -5C*, missing my sister‚Äôs birthday!! I helped others in school to copy homework, I helped them prepare to exams, but when I needed help, someone to practice with, they even asked for money in exchange (which it was impossible for me to afford), or they said ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt help rn!‚Äù. When I was sick (before the COVID thing), I needed a ride to the hospital because I was vomiting, I had a strong headache and I barely even move/talk. My OWN FAMILY MEMBER SAID THAT ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm busy rn.‚Äù and 10 minutes later, when I got some strength and walked to the bus, the mentioned ‚Äúmember‚Äù was at home, drinking beer in his window, not giving a fuck about Anything. It is NOT worth being good. It is NOT worth trying to be good‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just that, the ppl who say ‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôre doing it wrong‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to be good‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBeing good is more important than anything‚Äù are the ones who would Refuse to help out someone. Just some experience‚Ä¶ Long story short: Go out into the Real world and try to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù there instead of telling others what they do wrong.

‚ÄúA place where you can share what's on your mind and your problems.‚Äù
So, I will give it a try. English is not my first language so there will be mistakes for sure, but I Really want to‚Ä¶ Idk, ‚Äúshare‚Äù it maybe?
I don‚Äôt know how to express myself, to make others know and feel what I feel everyday. The shortest form would be ‚Äúit hurts‚Äù, but with A LOT more pressure‚Ä¶ I am 20. I was bullied in school from 1st grade to 12th and have abusive parents. My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù left me from time to time without any reason (like ‚Äúidk i dont like you anymore‚Äù or something), even tho I was a good friend to them (no ego, it‚Äôs just true). I‚Äôve got my (high school) graduation with pretty good grades then stayed for +1 year to get a ‚Äúprofession‚Äù wich is General System Administrator ( I think that‚Äôs how you say it in English, not sure). We broke up with my gf because she was cheating on me, even tho we were together 3 times (and broke up for the same reason, everytime), but I loved her. After the bullying, my parents and the fact that everyone (as friends, releationships) left and/or used me, I had VERY low self-esteem, Social anxiety, low confidence and I honestly dubt myself everytime, even when I was right. I started working out with some guys down at the gym and we helped eachother. After like 4 months, I felt more confident, but I was still in need of that small community to keep the motivation in me and say ‚Äúdo it‚Äù when I was about to quit. So, I lost some weight, gained some muscle but 4 months is not a lot especially if you have to miss it because you have to study for the finals. When I thought ‚Äúthis is the way I‚Äôll be fixed‚Äù, COVID came. We had to go home out of the dorm, we had no chance to go to the gym, no chance to meet and I felt weak to workout with my own weight, especially alone. I finished the prof. training, then went to College. Since COVID was still a thing I didn‚Äôt have the chance to go to a dorm (that‚Äôs a bit more complicated), didn‚Äôt have money to rent a small apartman or something and I had to travel for more than 4 hours daily, and still miss the first hour of the college. Then, they decided to let everyone have online classes, EXCEPT the first ‚Äúgrade‚Äù, so only WE had to be online for lecture and be in place for the rest. So, if I wanted to be online on the first 2 hours, I had to stay home, but right after that there was an in-place going on, so no matter what, I had to travel and miss the online classes. The correspondence courses were Only online, for everyone, so I decided to ask myself there. After 2 months(!), the.. like the ‚Äúoffice clerk‚Äù, still didn‚Äôt even respond to my thing, even tho I called them like 7 times, they took notes about who I am talking to and what message I want them to get, but still nohing happened I even called the leading‚Ä¶ idk, the ‚Äúchief‚Äù, idk how to say it, so the biggest and most important and blablabla of them and even she said she will get my message to my clerk. After another half month I wrote an email about how bad and irresponsible the whole school is and why the hell are they unable to get my message to my clerk, atleast 1 out of the other 9 people‚Ä¶ The next morning I‚Äôve got a phone call and she said she fixed it for me IN TEN MINUTES. TEN MINUTES!!! So I applied the request, because I was NOT able to study properly, I was completly messed up so this is an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù thing, because dude, this is my time, my money and both are going off VERY fast! And then, after like 3 months of sitting on my butt and bothering them ALL DAY LONG, the clerk did the job in TEN MINUTES???????????????? Then, after I looked up my timetable, I Still had the wrong classes and I couldn‚Äôt make up for everything they have learned because that was the time when you had NO classes for 3 more weeks and the professors were unreachable, the other students either and on the next classes they would have the first exam going on. I DIDNT EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE GROUPS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS!!! IMAGINE how triggered I was then! I still didn‚Äôt find any kind of job and I was already looking for one since May. We had to buy some books which are important of course, but didn‚Äôt have the money for them so obviously I had no chance to do anything, again. I quit the school and tried to look up and apply on more jobs but Still nothing (still, since may, nothing). I had One place to go where was like 20% chance to get a job, that was at my uncle, I could‚Äôve live with him and work near the place he lives. An amazing opportunity, right? Right. But on 24th of November, he passed away, he had a heart attack... He had multiple strokes back in the past, he was lactose intolerant, diabetic, gluten sensitive and so on, so he had very bad days. There were problems about his funeral too, since the person who examined him contacted the cops about that he had [[ POSSIBLE FEAR TRIGGER ]] needle punctures on the arm but holy sht, he was diabetic he had to inject himself everyday 3 times, how the hell did they miss that fact?!?!?!?!?? So obviously I was not able to move to him, he was the only one I enjoyed being with and he‚Äôs gone.
I wanted to draw, to paint, to code to build networks, I wanted to learn playing guitar, piano, wanted to shoot photos, wanted to try so many things to have atleast one hobby, but anything I mentioned my mother said ‚ÄúFor what? unnecessary you would stop it after days‚Äù, like she knew anything about me or knew me better than I do‚Ä¶ Anything I wanted or needed was unnecessary, all I had is just to be in my room with a laptop I bought from the money I got for graduating (so atleast I can do IT related stuff), nothing else. Oh and ofc the housework, running to the shop everyday, etc‚Ä¶ I never went to parties, never felt good even if I wanted to because I never had the chance to. I wanted to do or atleast try so many things, I wanted to be happy, and now all I have are panic attacks, intense memory loss, falling hair (like A LOT), questioning my identity, looking for a job (and now I don‚Äôt even have a social insurance because I couldn‚Äôt pay it and my parents refuse to, so if I had any kind of illness I would just pass away because even the doc is restricted to do anything with me, or only if I pay for it a lot more.
I had suicidal thoughts so many times, but never had the ‚Äústrength‚Äù to do anything bad. I had a psychologist, even them gave up on me. I tried my best and this is all I got. My days going I wake up, eat, laptop on, roll up job sites, my email, some other sites I have requests too, play for 10 minutes since I get bored of them very fast, go to the shop and grab like a million stupid things, on foot, go home, do the dishes, mop, etc, then listen to my alcoholic father‚Äôs stupidity, to my nervous (I think thats the right word) mother‚Äôs stupidity, to my sisters‚Äô hysterical things, it‚Äôs just too much. The 20 years of mine are just too much for me. I dont care that others might have worst times, I honestly dont care I listened to and tried to help everyone I met and nobody even tried to hear me and knowing that others have worse than me doesn‚Äôt do Anything to me, like I mean I wont feel better, my life wont get fixed. I‚Äôm just done! OH and, the funniest thing is that, yesterday the mother toldme that if I don‚Äôt get a job in weeks then they will kick me out. Like what the actual F?? How the hell could I tell an HR to ‚ÄúHEY YOU RECRUIT ME OK? OK! GOOD!‚Äù‚Äô ?? It‚Äôs not me who decides who gets a job and who doesn1t, I applied for like 65 ads in 7 months and still nothing or only refuses, even to like ‚Äústorage‚Äù jobs, not even a positive reply atleast from a factory job or something. EVERYTHNIG makes me feel and know that I am totally worthless and useless and I should‚Äôve not been born, that‚Äôs amazing! I once recovered from deep depression, was like one more line to cross and I end up in the psychiatry BUT I made it and now I‚Äôm deeper than that I crossed that line a million kms now and I get no help but I don1t even want anyone to help me now. I AM BROKEN!!!!! I don‚Äôt know what else to say, I just burst out crying, I thinnk ill have a panic attack in seconds. I just dont care what happens to me anymore. I would Honestly give it up right now, right in this fking second, this life is not mine, it couldn‚Äôt be me‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶

Is it wrong not to want a child with a disability?
It depends on how you say it.
I mean by that, if you say you don‚Äôt want a child with a disability, because you want them to be healthy and stuff, then it‚Äôs totally fine! Everyone wants their children to be healthy! But if let‚Äôs say you have a child who‚Äôs born with a disability, and you are against them because of that, then it‚Äôs not okay.
I hope you know what I mean! I still need my morning coffee to work properly!

Okay so this is going to be a serious and completely honest answer, so please, be ready to take in what I‚Äôm about to say. Maybe it is a surprise for you, as for many others too, but it‚Äôs never ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù. I also have to disagree with the ‚Äúnever shown any symptoms‚Äù part, because we do and I believe that she did too! Everyone does their own way and there are lots of reasons why and just as many forms as people alive. We just try to hide it from the ones who love us, with a reason! Maybe because we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the problem and we want to know it before we talk about it, or because we don‚Äôt want to hurt the ones if we do talk about it. Answering your question, in my honest opinion, you should, I could say, you must help your daughter especially now if she told you that by herself, wi‚Ä¶

This is the most accurate answer someone could ever give. And the most honest too. When I had an anxiety attack back in the days, I was at home with my family. My mother thought I‚Äôm just overreacting, and instead of trying to help, she started shouting at me as ‚ÄúStop acting like that!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou just look stupid at this point, stop it!‚Äù and things like that, so I just grab my coat and ran away, sat in the local park (which is mostly always empty) for hours, thinking about what just happened and why. We decide to be alone because of the folks' reactions around us, not because we think this is the only way to deal with our ‚Äúpain‚Äù. I, personally, tried so many times to explain it to my friends and family but seems like only one could understand and assist me in those times (well, mostly).

Why is my daughter claiming to be depressed? She gets practically everything she wants and gets away with a lot, there‚Äôs no reason for it.
Maybe she gets everything she Wants, but not everything she Needs. I hope you know what I mean.
If not:
I want a game that costs $50, but I actually need that money to pay the rent instead.
I will be happy with the game for a moment, but I won‚Äôt be happy if I get kicked out.
Same about the family.
I want a guitar to play on, I want a tablet to draw on, but it won‚Äôt make me happy longer than a moment.
I need love from my family to think and feel properly, I need people to know in order to socialize, I need someone to be my lover in order to be loved and feel the love in a different way.

I was born and raised and Minneapolis and still live there. It has nice culture, but wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Fall and spring are cold, and winter is long and freezing. It‚Äôs not at all uncommon for temps to constantly be in the negatives for the dead of winter. For instance, one time it was forecasted to be 19 degrees, and we got SO excited. Unless you like cold, DO NOT MOVE HERE. Summers can be hot but are pretty short, and there are lots of mosquitoes around dusk.

Did your parents have you old, my mom felt old compared to her younger friends who had kids in their twenties, my mom had me at 38,which I find VERY young to have a baby?
38 is not that young to have a baby. Women in their forties are reaching their limits for having kids, however my mom had me at 43. I know someone else who gave birth at 51. It‚Äôs all relative but people tend to have kids in their 20s to early or mid 30s.

Okay? Good for you? This child isn‚Äôt you. This is also a different decade; school has changed, jobs have changed. Life has changed, buddy, and this obsessive capitalist ‚Äúgrind‚Äù culture is ruining society and damaging people‚Äôs health. Now, you might not care about other people‚Äôs physical and mental health but keep your own issues in therapy and not in dumb reply to a kid on the internet.

What are some ways to deal with people who think you're going to hell?
Ignore them. Seems like a ‚Äúthem‚Äù problem tbh. If they want to spend their time anxious that you might be going to an imaginary place after death, that‚Äôs on them. If they ever bring it up to you, just joke about it. It‚Äôs not your problem.
For example,
‚ÄúEllie, aren‚Äôt you worried that you‚Äôre going to Hell?‚Äù
‚ÄúNah it‚Äôll be a party; I‚Äôm gonna be roommates with Stephen Fry and smoke hella weed.‚Äù

I'm 16, should I quit my job if they've made me work 16 hours my first weekend and I've only worked 2 days? This is my first job.
Okay people are being so incredibly harsh in the answers. Try not to take them to heart; as adults we‚Äôre all jaded about work and how we‚Äôre treated in this capitalist hellscape. I‚Äôve also been a manager for several years, so I can see it from both sides. If you like the job well enough and are just overwhelmed with two full days immediately (and it IS a lot to take in everything for a new job, especially in long shifts and especially when you‚Äôre not used to it), talk to your manager. Let them know that you want shorter shifts to begin with so you don‚Äôt get overwhelmed, or exhausted. If you‚Äôre also doing school full time, two full days of work on top of that is exhausting. I can‚Äôt imagine just throwing a 16yo into a full weekend of work with no prior experience, that seems insane to me. If yo‚Ä¶

What mental health defects can happen to a human once you put them in a cage?
Carlos, we talked about this. Stop putting people in cages.
On a serious note, I need more details to answer properly. Obviously depression and anxiety would become big concerns, but how big is said cage? Is it dog-crate sized or more like a prison cell? Are there amenities like a toilet and a bed? What‚Äôs the address of these cages?

Is thinking about dying but not because of your doing but a car accident or something out of your control normal?
I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but it‚Äôs definitely common. It‚Äôs referred to as being passively suicidal; you want to die but you don‚Äôt want to do it yourself. I‚Äôd suggest talking to some kind of counsellor or therapist if at all possible, as someone who has spent most of their life passively suicidal, I‚Äôll warn you that it can quickly spiral. Take care of yourself, look for things to make you happy even in the smallest ways. A lot of people go through this feeling for a while and then it eases and they feel okay again. Sending you love x

This is absurd. JKR doesn‚Äôt think trans people don‚Äôt exist or should be hurt; she‚Äôs arguing for women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs rights to be protected. Increasingly we‚Äôre seeing men taking over women‚Äôs spaces, positions on boards and councils reserved for women, pushing women out of our own sports, using self-ID as an excuse to infiltrate and harm. We‚Äôre not allowed to question a single male who says he‚Äôs trans (even if he looks exactly like a ‚Äúcis‚Äù man, lest we be fired, arrested, beaten or murdered. Women had to fight for hundreds of years for the rights we have now, and they‚Äôre systematically being dissolved by men who demand we lay down for them.
Not to mention, men are demanding lesbians sleep with them. Read about the cotton ceiling. Actually, read anything from detransitioners, women, lesbians and gay men, then also read what conservative christian‚Äôs have said about their trans kids. If you can‚Äôt see a pattern of forcing gender onto possibly-gay or autistic children, then I suggest you start asking women, in person, how they feel about being referred to as ‚Äúbleeders‚Äù, ‚Äúuterus owners‚Äù etc instead of women. Good luck.

Women cannot rape other women with their own penis, because women do not have penises. This is an absolutely ridiculous comment. A male person should be logged as a male sex offender, I have no idea why you think otherwise, but guess what - there are millions more male rapists as female. Men are more violent and cause irreparable psychological damage as well as physical during sexual assaults; to pretend otherwise is a slap in the face to all victims of sexual violence, both male and female, including myself.

Take her to a fucking therapist. tw ahead for self harm, eating disorders etc. When I was 18ish and I first told my mum I thought I had depression and wanted to see someone, I was already cutting myself daily, had lost a lot of weight because I had anorexia, and had 2 failed suicide attempts under my belt. My mother told me that I didn‚Äôt have depression, I was just being overdramatic. That was when our relationship turned bad. Eventually my older sister convinced her to take me to someone; the psychologist was great and after seeing me for a little while she met with my parents to explain to them that she thought I needed to be admitted before my body began shutting down from the anorexia and/or I actually hit an artery with my cutting.

He‚Äôs dishonest. He has lied in court up until it was proven he was lying, and then admitted things. He‚Äôs an alcoholic drug addict and always has been; he‚Äôs been reprimanded and removed from sets due to his treatment of people and showing up late and high etc.
Heard is a cheater, yes, but her former girlfriend did also come out and say that Heard being arrested for a domestic incident was due to a homophobic cop at an airport when they had a simple argument.
Whether or not you believe he was physically abusive (and I do, especially after hearing the original phone call audio before Depp stans edited it and shared it online), he treated her appallingly.
Facts that came up in court that he admitted to: he choked her; he sent text messages to Paul Bettany saying they should drown her, rape her corpse and then set her body on fire; abused her dogs on camera; sent her abusive texts calling her names and being incredibly biphobic and misogynistic; regularly got blackout drunk and high and many people testified to seeing him threaten her.
I don‚Äôt care if Amber is not a perfect person. I care that people who think she‚Äôs lying are perfectly fine with everything Depp has done that I‚Äôve just listed.
Read the transcripts. Listen to the original audio of that phone call. I don‚Äôt care if people think she‚Äôs lying about some of it; but pretending she‚Äôs made everything up for fame and money is misogyny and shows people don‚Äôt have critical thinking skills and/or do actually think violence against women and animals is okay if the woman isn‚Äôt perfect.

Well actually, there are several incidents like this that have happened over the years. A quick google (search engine) will show you many documented incidents - including the video of pigs literally tearing apart a human baby. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs happening every week but to say it ‚Äúnever‚Äù happens is false, just so you know.
A woman was eaten by her own pigs after she collapsed while feeding them
The 56-year-old farmer received fatal injuries after suffering an epileptic fit and collapsing while feeding her pigs.

Even if she didn‚Äôt have any serious mental health issues, why wouldn‚Äôt you allow her to see a therapist? Everyone could use therapy. Some more than others, but it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs asking you to buy her a motorcycle or something potentially dangerous. Why are you against your daughter seeking help? She‚Äôs incredibly mature for asking you about it. Most teenagers would find unsafe ways to cope.

Let her see a therapist. Please.
Maybe you didn't see the symptoms. Maybe only she notices them.
I believe you don't need to believe her to let her see a therapist. If she told you that she has a tummy ache, would you let her see a doctor only if you believe her?
I've known someone suffered from mental issues, and no one ever noticed. It's really painful. I really believe that you're a lucky mom, you should be grateful that your daughter opened up to you and told you that she needs to see a therapist, you should help your daughter.

I went through the exact same thing with my mom. She didn't believe me and I have spent the last 20 years dealing with the ramifications of not getting the help I needed. I showed no outward signs of mental health problems because I was internalizing everything and would put on the expected happy face. In reality I was having suicidal thoughts, severe anxiety, depression, self harming and eventually an eating disorder. Please take her to see a professional so they can determine if there is more going on then what can be seen.

I don't know why she allowed her friends to steal him but she knew I was fit to have him. He was for my trauma of miscarriages and I would have refused to take him if I was unable to properly care for him. I tried what I could the past few days to get him back but I have the kitten's sister in my care now so I'm thinking maybe let it go and let my little boy go too because the stress of going through everything could be a lot and I don't want to distract myself from the care of my baby.

Unfortunately, my ex's father is an ex cop so all of them KNOW you don't have to open the door without a warrent, I'm pretty sure she told them that the night I told her I was going over. I'm starting to think this is a lost cause right now and I have the sister of the kitten they stole right now and she's helping me a lot. BUT I am half tempted to text my ex's dad and tell him all the lies she's told and what she's done because how embarrassing is that to find out the child you raised is a thief, a liar, and over all just not that great of a person? He didn't know about me to start with, he knows she's into women but she was just stalling over the two months we were together.
This whole situation is just really messed up and I'm just glad I have the people around to help support me in whatever decision I make and my baby Lilith. I have pictures of her if you'd like!!

So, her and I's relationship was actually decent up until she ignored my emotions about my kitten being taken and she made no effort to help!! There are three people involved, my ex will be A, the girlfriend of the guy is B, and the guy is C.
Quora only allows me to put so much information but, the situation was she and I were planning on moving in together with her friends. My kitten was given to me on July 31st and we took him to meet our future roommates that night. They offered to assist in caring for him which I wasn't 100% comfortable with but my ex said it would be great since neither of us could have him at our respective homes at the moment. I told B and C i wanted to come out and take care of my kitten on days they're free and that's what was agreed upon. I texted him to ask about my kitten, got pictures, asked him if they could plan a day with me to see him. They ignored me when I asked.
August 8th, A texted me and told me B and C wanted to take my cat. I have been fighting tooth and nail, went to the apartment without her on August 10th-11th (had to wait for B to get there and we were there past midnight), called the cops, and nothing happened because they REFUSED to open the door. I told A the night I went that I was going to the apartment with or without her and she ended up blocking me the next day without a word. Part of me believes they conspired to steal my baby from the start but I don't have anything to back that up. I have videos from the night we went to the apartment from when we were waiting for an officer as proof of them being home and ignoring our (over) two hour attempt to get them to at least come out and talk to us.
This situation is messed up and I have hardly any hope court can do much for me because to them it's mundane and I can't afford legal fees like that. so I was considering texting their parents because A and B both stay with theirs. Part of me is scared though, since A's father is an ex cop.

If you call 911 by accident and tell the operator ‚Äúsorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to dial you,‚Äù will they still send someone out?
Fun little sorry.. . I was like 11 with my bestfriend at the time. We were in my dad‚Äôs car Infront of a pizza place. my friend had a very old iPhone, which was not set up. Being young and stupid, we both thought we should see if 911 would work on a old phone (ofc it did- but we were stupid kids) So, when my dad went to pick up the pizza. My friend dialed. Ofc they picked up and we gasped and hanged up. We, were at first like shocked. We googled and saw they show up regardless. Shitting bricks. My dad comes back and drops us at my house. We felt so guilty and scared. We feared we would get arrested. So, we sat on the front porch. Ate our pizza in silence as we waited for the cops to arrest us. They never came and we learned our lesson haha

I adopted a 2 year old dog. She spends the whole day in the guest room away from us and doesn't seem to love us at all. It's been a month. Is this normal?
The shelter is an extremely stressful environment, as is moving into a new home. The rule of threes is a good timeline for behavioral expectations when bringing a new shelter animal into your home. 3 days - feeling overwhelmed and uncomfortable with their new environment 3 weeks - starting to get comfortable and learn their new routine 3 months - settled in, knows that they are home with their new family Now, these are just guidelines, every dog is different and some may take more or less time. Your pup is probably just overwhelmed and still settling in. I‚Äôd recommend moving food, water and her bed into her chosen space and let her decide when she wants to come out. Frequently go and spend time in the room with her, read a book or listen to quiet music and allow her to get comfortable around y‚Ä¶

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
What should you do? You take her to see a therapist and then you let your adult daughter decide what treatment (if any) is best for her. My mother ignored my requests to go see a therapist and then once I did finally see one, I was given three diagnosis of varying severity. The advice of the medical professional was ignored and I was never informed of the results of my evaluation. I was a pre-teen at that time which makes my situation a little different, but similar in that my mother denied me treatment. Fast forward 15 years later to my first major breakdown and the beginning of long-term medicated therapy and out-patient rehabilitation. It took 6 years to get an accurate diagnosis, find medication that worked and I finally started feeling better. One of those disorders ended up being Bipol‚Ä¶

In addition to the safety risks, flexi leashes also teach and reinforce pulling. When a dog pulls on a retractable leash, while it does allow them free movement, there is still pressure that the dog can feel on its neck or harness. This means that they learn that despite backwards pressure, all they need to do is pull hard enough and they‚Äôll get to go where they want.

What‚Äôs the most depressing meal you‚Äôve eaten?
The absolute most sorrow filled and depressing meal was one where I did not eat. My father called me at 8 PM, in tears and asking that I come meet him at the hospital ER. He had been walking with his girlfriend (now my step-mother) when a distracted driver struck her while in a crosswalk. Thankfully, the injuries were not life threatening but there was a very high probability that she would need a leg amputated. We went to the hospital cafeteria where my father bought a container of Peach Yoplait. Sitting across from him in that cafeteria, crying as he ate the yogurt was the most vulnerable and hurt that I have ever seen him.

What's the weirdest thing you've found in a hotel room?
When I was a traveling District Manager, I had a couple regular hotels that I frequented. One particular trip, I had my dogs with me. I had checked in late and was just out of the shower when one of my dogs crawled out from under the bed and dropped a large clove of garlic at my feet. No idea why someone would hide garlic under the bed, but I wasn‚Äôt about to remove that clove of garlic that had been so carefully hidden away. It was clearly something important. Fast forward 2 months later. I get a late night text from a colleague who was staying in that same room. Garlic! I‚Äôm assuming the same clove, as this one had started sprouting. Also at this hotel, but from the bar which was definitely not as professionally run. Brought back to my room after a very long day, an old fashioned. Much to my s‚Ä¶

THIS. People who refuse to accept our natural biological curiosity never expand their mind and conscience. They take things lightly simply because they‚Äôve never allowed themselves to really SEE the horrors of violence. And I think that in itself is more numbing to violence than feeding into your curiosity

I can vouch for this. I was neglected as a child and therefore was never taught dental hygiene growing up. On top of developing bipolar disorder I never brushed my teeth. Only for special occasions like weddings or the morning before a dentist appointment. Before I finally picked up the habit I was waking up to bits of crumbled teeth in my mouth all the time. Poor dental habits are a lot more common than people realize. Just because a product is available doesn‚Äôt mean everyone uses it.

That‚Äôs not the only site. You can also do a ventrogluteal injection yourself. Which is the muscle that covers the outside crest of the pubic bone (not your upper glute.) It‚Äôs less painful than the thigh.
To find the site get a marker or pen and make a dot where you feel the crest/curve of your hip bone end right before it dips down. (That sharper part that juts out.)
Then inch your fingers across the crest and make a dot at the highest most part of the crest/curve, which should be maybe an inch or two away from sharper part going in the direction toward your back.
Then use the palm of your hand to press down and find the hip joint, where the femur meets the pelvis. It‚Äôll be the large lump, put a dot there.
Connect the dot at your hip bone to both of your other 2 dots at the crest. It should end up looking like an arrow pointing toward your feet.
Your site will be in the middle of that V. This site has minimal arteries or nerves to worry about, which is why many doctors say it isn‚Äôt necessary to aspirate this site in particular. Lay down and prop yourself up as much as you can with pillows, blankets whatever you have. Cross the leg you‚Äôre going to be injecting over the other leg until you feel that when you press a finger into the V, it‚Äôs soft. (Hard would mean it‚Äôs flexing, which would be super painful.)
Stretch the skin tight with your non dominant hand and inject like normal. It‚Äôs comfortable, it‚Äôs not as painful and it‚Äôs not as worrisome for those with medical anxiety like me lol. There‚Äôs also ZERO pain afterwards.
if you‚Äôre a bigger person and have a harder time feeling where the hip bone is, I would try spreading just the leg you‚Äôre injecting, outward. Where the skin creases or the leg bends is where your hip bone is. To find the crest stand up and drop your arm. Where your elbow lands is generally where it is. You can use elbow level or belly button level. It‚Äôs hard to mess this injection up, so if you can‚Äôt find exactly where the lower crest and higher crest is, don‚Äôt stress too much. Just figure out where the entire crest is and inject somewhere into the muscle that is right above the top of the hip joint. Just be sure to get a longer needle as there is usually more fat in that area. You think you may surely hit bone, but I promise you won‚Äôt.

Poorly designed?? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the best human design out of both men and women. The bounce back it has from going to the size of a watermelon back down to a mere few centimeters wide is incredible design.

How does it feel to have boobs on your chest?
you definitely feel something is there. Always. But once you get used to it you rarely think about it. But reading this question has put all my attention on how much weight is there, and I have to say it‚Äôs not very comfortable. They feel sore to varying degrees most days, and grabbing them/feeling them isn't as pleasant as guys think it is. And it‚Äôs much different than putting weights on your chest, cause that doesn‚Äôt include the sensation and nerve endings we feel constantly. We FEEL our boobs from the inside out if that makes sense.

I feel no sympathy for the homeless because I feel like it is their own fault. Are there examples of seemingly ""normal"" and respectable people becoming homeless?
I was very close to being homeless. I was married. 1 child. I had a masters in education and was working on my teaching certification. I was working full-time. My husband ran up credit card debt buying music equipment because he wanted to pursue music full time (despite my protests). After he ran up the debt he divorced. Legally I‚Äôm responsible for any joint debt. The judge ordered the house sold and all proceeds used to pay off the debt. That would have left me with no home. No money. Everything had to be used (according to judges orders) to pay off his debt. I had nowhere to go. I had friends but no one who could take in me and a child for any length of time.

As a new mother, did you constantly feel like you weren't doing or being enough for your child to excel, even though you were doing everything you knew to do?
Absolutely! We want our children to have the best opportunity for success, happiness, stability‚Ä¶and we do our very best to teach them everything we think they may need to know. We sign them up for classes or try to choose good schools or provide them with opportunities to learn, grow. We never feel like it‚Äôs enough. The thing is, we can‚Äôt anticipate or prepare our children for everything. We can give them all the tools they‚Äôd need for one life and they end up leading a very different one.

Should kids feel obligated to say yes to their parents? (ex. I asked my child to play old maid with me, and she said no because she was 'tired' from making her siblings food, and doing school. I believe it's selfish to say no.)
No. Kids should be able to say no to anyone and what follows should be a discussion about why they are saying no. There is a huge range of requests a child receives to which they could respond no. For example, you wanted to play a game, your child did not. Your daughter said no and also provided a legitimate reason and from your description, wasn‚Äôt rude. If you ask a child to go clean their room and they say no, then you follow-up with a conversation about why - you will learn a lot about your child, they will feel like you respect them, and at the end of the conversation, more likely than not, you will have a child who is willing to go clean their room. Maybe they‚Äôre overwhelmed with the mess - ok, so maybe you help or break it down to more manageable tasks. Maybe they‚Äôre in the middle of‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt. It you are worried about being a horrible parent, that means you care. If you care, then you‚Äôre doing the best you can and that‚Äôs all you can do. Every kid is different. Every parent is different. Every situation is different.

Yes. I‚Äôve seen this a lot, at all ages, and I‚Äôm always surprised. I don‚Äôt know how this dynamic gets created - I‚Äôd be interested to read about that. Here are just a couple of examples. Softball: I was driving my daughter and a teammate to a game. The teammate‚Äôs dad was meeting us there. The game was about 2 hours away and we were about 45 minutes into the drive. The teammate called her dad to make sure he had all of the things she wanted (she had her gear with her - she wanted certain snacks, etc.). She asked if Dad had grabbed the water bottle she wanted. He said no, but he had tons of bottles of water in a cooler. She yelled at him, ‚ÄúI told you I wanted my water bottle! It‚Äôs on the counter! I don‚Äôt want bottles of water! I want my water bottle!‚Ä¶Yes! Go back and get it! Why do you think I‚Ä¶

If it were somehow possible to keep your child an age of your choice for the rest of your life, would you do it?
No. I have loved every age so far and I want to see how her life evolves. I wouldn‚Äôt want to freeze anyone at any age.

What is the importance of children in parents life?
My daughter is the most important ‚Äúthing‚Äù in my life. I only say thing instead of person because she‚Äôs more important than my job or possessions as well as people. I thought this was an odd question, but the more I think of it, answers from people who don‚Äôt think that their children are important, at least maybe in comparison to other things, would be interesting to read.

What was the kindest thing someone did for you when you were young?
There were so many kind things people have done but there is one that, although very small, stands out the most. I was maybe 5, 6 years old. We were living in Japan and my parents and I were in a department store. I was terrified of escalators‚Ä¶terrified. My parents tried to get me to go down the escalator but I refused. So, they went down without me and stood at the bottom telling me to come down. I remember just being terrified, standing at the top, looking at my parents, and having no idea how I was going to get down. A very elderly woman came up to me, and in the gentlest way just held my hand. I don‚Äôt remember if she said anything. I just remember her holding my hand and then we got on the escalator and rode down together and I wasn‚Äôt scared at all. All I remember is just an overwhelmin‚Ä¶

What is something your child has done or said which brought to tears?
‚ÄúMommy, are those birds?‚Äù Backstory: My daughter used to get ear infections frequently. She hardly ever cried but she‚Äôd get a fever and then I‚Äôd bring her in and yup, ear infection. Her pediatrician recommend tubes, but also said that sometimes as kids grow, the issue can resolve itself. So, I waited. I was afraid of anesthesia. When she was about 4, her pediatrician told me to go get a second opinion from an ENT. So, I did. She had severe hearing loss in both her ears. The doctor was amazed there weren‚Äôt any speech issues and said it was absolutely time to get tubes. So, she got tubes. She slept with me that night and when she woke up, the birds were chirping. When she asked if those were birds my heart broke. All this time she had never heard the birds. I felt like a terrible mom. But, sh‚Ä¶

To what extent are parents responsible for who their children turn out to be?
Wow, this is a really tough question and a good one. Your question says ‚Äúwho‚Äù their children turn out to be - not what. If you meant what, as in career and success, then maybe parents are very responsible - although I couldn‚Äôt even begin to put some sort of a number on it. If you have parents who are able to provide you with resources and connections and opportunities, then that child will become ‚Äòsomething‚Äô. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they will be patient, empathetic, kind, loving, supportive‚Ä¶which is what I think of when I think of ‚Äòwho‚Äô. A parent with very little means can still raise a child who ends up becoming a ‚Äògood‚Äô person. You also hear stories of children who grew up in very bad situations who become good people - both in terms of who they are and what they are. You also hear of‚Ä¶

Thank you. It took some time to turn it into
something positive but it helped me be a better mom to my daughter, truly understand those kids who long for a parent‚Äôs love and can‚Äôt get it, be more patient and understanding with kids I work with who have experienced or continue to experience trauma, and help others understand that the ‚Äúbad‚Äù kid in front of them is just a kid who‚Äôs been so hurt or neglected that all they know is anger. I made a lot of bad choices growing up because of that void. I wasn‚Äôt a bad kid. I‚Äôve helped a lot of kids and a lot of people who work with kids understand behavior because i am say, ‚ÄúDo you know what I was like in school?‚Äù and they can‚Äôt believe it. I lashed out at the world for a long time until one person saw who I really was and gave me a chance to be better. Now I just try to pay it forward.

What is a family secret you didn't know as a kid, but now as an adult you do and when you look back it explains a lot of things?
I was an accident. My mom didn‚Äôt want me. My parents weren‚Äôt married. My mom was Japanese and my dad a Navy guy stationed there. She never wanted to be a mom and certainly didn‚Äôt want to be married to an American. My dad begged her to keep me and promised her the world. She did and they were married when she was 5 months pregnant with me. My whole life she was mean to me. Nothing was ever good enough. I was intolerable. I know part of that is the Asian mom thing, but part of it was that she simply never wanted me. My brother was planned. And again, I know culturally boys and girls are treated differently, but my brother had the complete opposite life experience. He could do no wrong. C? C-? That‚Äôs ok, you tried. A, A-?

What kinds of social, physical, or emotional repercussions do you think children might face from being on lock down for the next few months?
That will depend entirely on where they‚Äôre locked down, with whom, and what resources are available to their household. If you are a child in a home with abusive people, insufficient shelter, food, medication‚Ä¶then the repercussions could end in death. If you are a child with adults who are capable of caring for you and you have no worry of not having your basic needs met, have access to your friends through online platforms, and have siblings or pets or parents who will play with you, then you‚Äôll come out ok. Everyone will miss some social development time, but that gap will close quickly once the kids can play freely. Then there‚Äôs everyone in between. There are kids who are the only caretaker with a sick adult. There are kids who are listening to adults fight because they‚Äôve just lost the‚Ä¶

the answer to your question is hard for you but so simple. love them for who they are. no matter what your child will keep being your child regardless of what they identify as. it will be better for you and your child if you could just accept them, if anything it would make your relationship stronger rather than hurt it.

My sister (11) started smoking weed and got a vape, how do I get her to stop? I have addictions myself and I don‚Äôt want her to have what I have at such a young age.
Bro she's 11. I started smoking weed at a young age too, I was maybe 13 or 14 (it's normal in my country to start at that age cause it's legal here), but 11?? Nahh. That's elementary. Take it away from her, she probably didn't even hit puberty yet, it could fuck up her body. It isn't a hard drug but still yk. Just tell her about how most drug addicts take 5-15 years to fully quit. Shes probably trynna feel grown up and stuff. It seems fun but it aint. Shes gonna regret it in her later years.

Your daughter trusted you so much she decided to tell you what's going on? And you dont believe her??? God I bet she fucking hates you now. You'll never win her trust back.

Nobody thought anything was wrong with him until we took him to a therapist and he got diagnosed with 5 illnesses. Yes 5. Tourette, ocd, adhd, anxiety and depression. He lost the depression, but I suspect he's falling back into it. Mental illness is not a joke. If someone says they need help you give it to them. We gave my brother help, but it was to late.

With rough childhood I mean severe traumatic experiences. My brother has 4 mental sicknesses. He doesnt know whats right and whats not. He has beaten me up every day since I was 9 ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù I never told my parents cus I dont want to cause him anymore trouble then he already has. He also used to force me to take drugs at like 11 and im not sure what the reason behind that was but still. He‚Äôs now basically a criminal. He robs people armed with knives, beats up random people for no reason and is a dealer and hes only 16. We just started getting along a little bit. Probably cus im a little older to now. He shows me videos of what he does and I just act like I find it cool because I just want to be liked by my big brother. My ma has already called the police, but they say they can‚Äôt do anything when they don‚Äôt have really good evidence and I dont want to snitch the videos on his phone cus I know what will happen if I do. So um I think hobbies wont work. And btw im my mind is pretty grown compared to other kids my age, because it always HAD to be. Believe me I didnt want this either. And if your so convinced hobbies work, I already have alot of them.

Could any psychological disorders explain why Michael Myers did what he did in Halloween?
This is a fun question haha, there are a few psychological disorders that could potentially explain Michael Myers' behavior: 1. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD): This disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of others, deceitfulness, and lack of remorse for one's actions. Individuals with ASPD may engage in violent or aggressive behaviors, which could explain Michael's propensity for murder. 2. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. It's possible that Michael's relentless pursuit of his victims might be driven by delusions or hallucinations. 3. Psychopathy: Psychopathy is a personality trait char‚Ä¶

Do you know of any psychological terms that describe someone who has multiple personalities, or who seems to have different personalities depending on who they're with?
Yes, there are a few psychological terms that may describe someone who appears to have multiple personalities or exhibits different personalities depending on who they're with: 1. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID): Previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder, DID is a rare and complex mental disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct and separate identities or personality states, which recurrently take control of the individual's behavior. People with DID typically have experienced severe and prolonged trauma, often during childhood. 2.

Do you think it is wrong for people to pretend to have illnesses or disorders for attention?
Yes, I believe it is morally and ethically wrong for people to pretend to have illnesses or disorders for attention. This behavior, often referred to as Munchausen syndrome or factitious disorder, is not only deceptive, but it also undermines the experiences of those who genuinely suffer from such conditions. When someone feigns an illness or disorder, they may receive unwarranted sympathy, support, and resources, which could be better directed towards individuals who are truly in need. Moreover, this behavior can create mistrust and skepticism towards those who are genuinely struggling with illnesses or disorders, as it may cause others to question the validity of their claims. This can lead to further stigmatization and alienation for those who are genuinely suffering, as well as a decrea‚Ä¶

What does it say about you as a person if you tend to attract borderlines,or in some cases, have a history of dating many different individuals with BPD?
It could suggest that the person has certain traits or behaviors that are attractive to individuals with BPD. For example, people with BPD often experience intense emotions and may be drawn to individuals who are empathetic and have strong emotional sensitivity. Additionally, people with BPD may struggle with abandonment and rejection, and may therefore seek out partners who are emotionally available and provide a sense of stability and security.
It is also possible that the person may have certain patterns or tendencies in their relationships that contribute to attracting or dating individuals with BPD. For example, they may have a history of codependent behaviors or may struggle with setting and maintaining healthy boundaries in relationships.

Creating a ""safe place"" for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) can have several potential consequences, both positive and negative. On the positive side, a safe place can provide a supportive environment for individuals with BPD to express their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors without fear of judgment or rejection. This can lead to increased feelings of safety, security, and trust, which are essential for individuals with BPD to develop healthy coping strategies and relationships. A safe place can also offer access to professional mental health services and resources that can help individuals with BPD manage their symptoms and improve their overall quality of life.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
It's important to understand that mental health issues can manifest in different ways and at different times in a person's life. It's not uncommon for symptoms to appear suddenly, especially during major life transitions such as entering adulthood. Therefore, it's important to take your daughter's concerns seriously and provide her with the support she needs. It's not uncommon for people to hesitate seeking help due to the stigma surrounding mental health issues. The fact that your daughter has expressed a desire to see a therapist is a positive step, and you should encourage her to follow through with her decision.

How many,if any, apologies have you received from a narcissist?
As a victim of narcissistic abuse, I've had my fair share of apologies thrown my way. Or so I thought. At the beginning of our relationship, everything was perfect. He was charming, loving, and made me feel like I was the center of his universe. But as time went on, I started to see a different side of him. He became manipulative, controlling, and would do anything to get what he wanted. Whenever he would hurt me, which was often, he would apologize. But it was never a sincere apology. It was always a way for him to manipulate me into forgiving him so he could continue to control me. I remember one time he apologized for cheating on me. But it wasn't a real apology.

Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that affects the brain's structure and function, leading to a range of symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and abnormal behavior. Diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia involve a thorough evaluation of a person's mental and physical health, including medical history, psychiatric symptoms, and neurological function.

Not everyone who chooses not to have kids thinks of it as something to brag about. However, some people may express their decision not to have children proudly or confidently because of the societal pressure to conform to the traditional norm of parenthood. For many years, having children has been viewed as a natural progression of life, and those who choose not to follow this path may be perceived as deviating from societal norms. This pressure can be particularly strong for women, who are often expected to prioritize motherhood over other life goals.

Yes, some employers do allow minors to apply. When I was in charge of hiring at my job, we allowed minors to apply as long as they had a workers permit with valid proof of identity.
If the age requirement is specifically 16 and you apply 5 days before your 16th birthday ‚Äî assuming you use an online application ‚Äî the system may not allow you to apply until you turn the required age because the birthdate validation will not pass.

What should I do? I have a crush on a 12 year old girl as a 49 year old man. I‚Äôm dating her mom, but I was wondering if I should wait until she‚Äôs 16 (age of consent) to ask her out? I need help, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm on Quora I know this isn‚Äôt right
No. Stop dating her mom. Lose contact with her and her family on all platforms (phone, email, social media). Waiting until the age of consent is ‚Äî I'll say it ‚Äî creepy. Grossly inappropriate. Scary. Do not pursue this.
You do need help, but it's not the kind of help that can be offered here unless someone can refer you to a psychiatrist.

Should you call/email human resources to check on an application if it is the only number listed?
In short ‚Äî IMO, if you apply and the only contact info provided after applying is HR, then I'd say it's fair game to reach out.

I‚Äôm 17 and I still wet myself at both day and night. Should I be wearing diapers or pull ups, and what do I do?
Get an enuresis alarm off Amazon. Another user recommended this from a different question on this topic. You clip it to the front of your underwear and an alarm will go off if it detects wetness. Obviously better for night time wear.
But also might wanna get a check up when you can, might be an underlying health issue.

Hello I have a 17 year old son and he has bed wetting issues I decided to put him back in diapers but I‚Äôm not sure what kind of baby diapers would fit so far I have him in pull ups any baby diapers that could fit him for I could buy them?
You could try adult diapers. Not sure they have the capacity for a full bladder though as they're usually used to help with occasional leaks. But the sensation of the wet fabric against his body may help wake him up during a bed wetting incident.
Maybe consider a waterproof mattress protector, too.
Have him use the restroom before bed and maybe look into what's causing the bed wetting. Sometimes underlying health conditions can set it off.

Is their account hindering their performance at your job? Are you uncomfortable for subscribing?

Are they wearing your company logo or sharing proprietary information in their OF content?

Is it imaginary thinking if a 5-year-old thinks their parent is not their parent, but a stranger in disguise and acts suspicious around them? I couldn't find anything about it on the internet.
Sounds a bit like Capgras Syndrome, possibly? Here‚Äôs an article on it.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3520716/
It‚Äôs a type of Delusion Misidentification Syndrome. There are many types of DMS, here‚Äôs another article detailing them if Capgras Syndrome doesn‚Äôt feel accurate enough.
The Masks of Identities: Who's Who? Delusional Misidentification Syndromes
Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMSs) are complex psychotic phenomena that may be present in a variety of ways within the context of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Since the first case of Capgras syndrome was described in 1923, various other syndromes have been identified, including Fregoli syndrome, intermetamorphosis, subjective doubles, reduplicative paramnesia, mirrored self, delusional companions, and clonal pluralization of the self. In this article, we review each of the different syndromes in definition and presentation, as well as the field's attempts at classifying them. We then describe their role in forensic psychiatry, particularly in regard to their potential as a marker of a particular subpopulation or of illness severity and their consideration in risk assessments of violence. A review of the literature was conducted for this purpose, and, although it was extended to include publications from over four decades, it revealed a paucity of research on DMSs.

My mother went on a date with Richard Ramirez ( aka the Night Stalker). She said at first glance she thought he was a fairly attractive guy, but from the moment they sat down and started talking, she felt uneasy. She said his eyes were like nothing she‚Äôs ever seen. She struggled to pinpoint why she felt so uncomfortable and anxious, and she said she would normally just pass it off as her social anxiety disorder, but something told her that she wasn‚Äôt just overthinking. She ended up pretending to be sick, gave him a fake number, and had her strong male friend pick her up in case, and she luckily never saw him again until his face was in the news.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Respectfully, you do not know how easy it is to hide things from parents. I have dealt with mental illness my whole life. I started self-harming when I was 8, by 14 I had attempted to take my own life twice, by 7th grade my eating disorder was so bad that my organs, heart, and lungs were shutting down. And my family had absolutely ZERO idea what was going on. Maybe she is good at hiding the symptoms, or maybe you aren‚Äôt good at seeing them, but just because you aren‚Äôt aware of the problem and the symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean they aren't there. If a child tells you her stomach hurts, you don‚Äôt simply say ‚Äúno it doesn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äù because you can‚Äôt see it.

How do I tell my 13-year-old daughter that she can't have her phone after 6pm?
I know this doesn‚Äôt help that much, but I really do think you should reconsider that rule if you want to have a good relationship to your daughter. The thing is, it might just seem like a phone to you, but for most teenagers their phone is the biggest component of their social life. It is how they talk to their friends, play with them, laugh with them, cry and bond with them in times of need, and become closer with people they weren't too close with before. Most kids don't go on their phone socially until late in the evening, around 7‚Äì10, so if she is only allowed her phone until 6 she will be missing out on the vast majority of this. Take it from someone with strict parents: her social life will suffer GREATLY. As much emphasis as possible on ‚Äúgreatly‚Äù. And consequently, so will your rela‚Ä¶

So many of the answers are uncomfortable or gross üòÖ
just say ‚Äúwoops"" ‚Äúsorry bout that"" and never speak of it again.
Try to prevent it from happening in the future.
It feels like maybe this question was asked on purpose to get gross answers. But in the hope that it wasn't-
accidents happen. You don't have to do anything except move on and block it from your memory.

There might be a lot of answers including - she's asexual. She could enjoy feeling slightly romantically close to you but does not want any sexual attention.
I would just mirror her actions and enjoy the connection for what it is or move on. If she wants more, let her be the one to initiate. It's not worth the chance that you could be coming off super creepy.
If she sends romantic songs, send some back. If she sits close, sit closely with her.
If you put your arm around her, and she shrugs you off,
then you are probably not going to get anywhere past love songs and sitting close.

thank you- it has been a very delicate journey for me‚Ä¶ trying to navigate this- a couple weeks ago I realized just how much anxiety I have. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I'm constantly thinking about leaving. Like, not even rationally- it's from a place of fight or flight.
But at the same time I do have hope still of things getting better‚Ä¶ so I won't be getting a divorce just yet. What has made me hopeful is he has been working with me lately, more than he ever has been. He has agreed to go to therapy as a couple, and also on his own- (this is all very new, so we will see where it goes)
And has been trying to stop watching porn and trying not to pressure me. What has alarmed me is‚Ä¶just the other night, this has been about a week of him trying to quit porn-
he sleep walked. As in, he was 100% asleep and tried having sex with me in his sleep. I was only partially conscious myself as I was in a deep sleep but managed to push him away and wedge myself between the mattress and the wall.
I think something must be deeply wrong- for even his subconscious to be so desperate. I'm hoping to see what happens as we address it‚Ä¶ and work on it.
Thank you for your words- it was a strong reminder that I don't have to give in or appease this behavior. That I don't have to feel bad for not giving him more than what I feel up for.

Life is so strange‚Ä¶
I try to give my husband sex on average once a day but he complains that it isn't enough. He will talk to me about his needs and get quite emotional about it, but I can't seem to push myself much farther at all without feeling like a slave myself.
I would give counseling a shot. Women are hard to understand and who knows‚Ä¶ maybe there are legitimate reasons she has chosen to act this way- like past abuse or trauma or anxiety.
Or maybe she needs a third party to make her see the reality of the situation. However, if she has continued to refuse help, or it doesn't improve in like 6 months,
Then start the divorce process. At that point, it isn't even about sex- it is about her inability to compromise or see outside of herself. And the resentment that builds can't allow love.
But work on yourself- my goodness work on yourself. Workout, get therapy for yourself, lean on friends and family for support‚Ä¶ learn how to dress nice and how to do your hair- find hobbies and passions and do your best to feel okay without sex.
I recognize sex is a truly legitimate need, but you probably have fixated on it quite a lot- and the anxiety depression and resentment isn't something you want to carry around if you want to appear as attractive as possible to other people. I encourage you to look to other things, lean on other things, to fill your life up. Just be as vibrantly independent as you possibly can- find ways to be that. Learn from therapists and books how to be that.
Divorce is ugly. So be prepared in everyway to withstand that- but it could be worth it to find someone who will reciprocate the love and dedication you are willing to give.

üëÅüëÅ holy CRAP. Your libido is identical to mine‚Ä¶ and your fiance is identical to my husband's.
Except for him, if we go a day or 2 without sex, it reeeally starts to get to him‚Ä¶ he gets irritable, and will pressure me like a car salesman to give in. He has gotten close to practically raping me a few times‚Ä¶ one time I had to threaten him to stop.
Sometimes he will even get emotional about how unfulfilling our sex life is for him, even though on average we have it once a day.
It's made me wonder if he is somehow addicted to sex and having withdrawls..??? He is usually a very sweet person besides this. But he does have anxiety and watches hours and hours of porn‚Ä¶
How do I know if he has a high sex drive and is actually ‚Äúin need"" and miserably suffering without sex‚Ä¶ (like he says)
or if he is addicted to sex‚Ä¶ and is having withdrawls‚Ä¶ (Like I think)
or if he is just being selfish‚Ä¶?
I've talked extensively to him about this and I think he is finally coming around and trying to change his views and behaviors, but- can a man truly have a crazy high sex drive and actually be okay not having sex?

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
If you met my sister, you would think she was the happiest person in the world. Huge smile. Always laughed. Was going to college and holding a job.
Right before graduating, she attempted suicide- and the only reason she is here today is because I felt like calling my mom and telling my mom to go visit her.
My mom found her and rushed her to the hospital.
You don't get to decide if your daughter has symptoms. Let a therapist evaluate and meet with her- they are trained.
Also, even if she is PERFECTLY fine- preventative treatment can save her from a life of mental hell later on. The earlier people start treating their mental health, the better they will be.

I don't know why I phrased it in that way though; I think it was because at the time (as a teenager) I didn't see myself in an interacial relationship, probably because I didn't know or see anyone in my small town who was.

Can people with paralysis regain control of their limbs?
It depends on how the paralysis started. If it's a nerve that got impinge then yes there's a chance you can fix that and then slowly gain its paralysis back. It's a bullet to its spine. That's a tuff one but it will take time and good doctors.

How do the physical symptoms of stress manifest in the body?
It comes from over thinking and anxiety. When you believe your in the gutter you become in the gutter. It's a very easy thing to bring forth. Like if you feel like your being watched, but yet can't prove it, but also can prove it but you don't want to say anything about it. It's like buying a cake and dropping it, a thousand times and you look at it knowing it will happen again. That's anxiety and over thinking.
To stop it is very hard. You have to know and believe everything will be okay.

2- Address the location of the business.(All business or their name.(All business's have their location and if they don't say it then it's most likely a scam. Or just Google search their business name) This isn't always the case due to scammers using real business names as a disguise.¬∂

3- if they do use a business name like wells Fargo. Ask for a bade ID number and then contact the real wells Fargo. (If that business is fake but they seem legitimate take screen shot and don't press any links they physically send you.

4- make sure you have all of your files saved on a USB or hard drive so if they do have your computer you can always buy a new one a day then restore it with your USB.¬∂

5- Contact the fbi, google, and the real business about unsafe scammers and a detailed conversation about what the scammer was saying during the time of the scam.¬∂

That's all honestly the experience and what a fbi agent told me, gather details as much as possible, contact other resources, and try not to say their work addressget get scammed again. He also stated the fact that 80% of of the time scammers will get away.

You know why you can't find him. He's probably using software, VPN, spoofing, and other hacks or techniques to hide himself from a screen. The best thing to do is gather as much evidence. Every conversation with the scammer, Try to gather information. Collect and save every information the scammer gives you. Then make sure you put it in different saved files and save some on the USB, to your emails, to give to the authorities or your trusted fbi agents. Then the only thing you can do is just tell them what happens step by step. Most scammers have to go on a script and some fbi agents can follow the script and see where it's mostly used from.

How and why might our dreams alert us to ill health or impending disease? How might researchers use sleep study of what takes place physiologically in the brain during dreams to help develop new medical devices and interventions?
Well dreams can mean multiple of things. Dreams can be a future event that will take place to a fantasy having pleasures with a person you desire, to flying in a dream. I wouldn't count dreams to be a good source of alerts. But what dreams can indicate is what we psychologically want or fear of. What you should focus more is on your physical states and body. If you feel sick by the way your nails look, the way your poop looks, to the way your eyes are waking up in the morning. May physical reactions will occur if you are sick. Your body will fight it off and make sure you are a live. And when you feel like you have a illness you start to get scared and then dream about having an illness which can cause you to psychologically weaken your immune system.

Does it take severe force to injure your brain stem?
No it doesn't need severe force to injure your brain stem. But the brain stem is being protected by the thoracic vertebrae, the neck muscles, and the skull. Even though it's located under the brain directly close to the bottom of the skull. It's being protected by all the muscle and bones there. Our neck muscles can handle great tons of force during flexion. But when we are relaxed we can get our neck snapped like a twig. Since none of the bones are actually connected its just ligaments, and tendons that helps us connect bone to bone and bone to muscles. Since...

What are the effects of raising the body's temperature on cells and tissues? How much damage can be caused by a short increase in body temperature (for example with heat exhaustion)?
The obvious answer is hyperthermia.
The damage wouldn't be fatal unless left untreated. (If treated 100% survivability if untreated jumps from 50% to 100% of death rate. People mostly die because of dehydration. So just drink water room temperature water. Caution with cold because it could affect the body negatively but should be fine.)
The effect/symptoms can be dizziness, vertigo, regurgitation, dehydration, and cold sweats.
Unless you are just talking about how fast you can raise the body temperature. Quite quickly, it's also beneficial for the pores in the skin to open up and release all of the gunk. That's why when you take hot showers your dead skin comes off it's also all the gunk in your pores coming out as well. Then reciving cold showers is also healthy because it closes ...

Why am I so afraid of seeing faces or eyes in the dark that I can barely make out? Images with dark hallways with glowing eyes in the back or almost completely dark faces are one of the scariest things to me.
It's a psychological effect. To be very honest everyone is scared of what's in the dark. Random faces, things that aren't supposed to be there but are there and then dissappear.
üëÅüì∑üì∏
Words on the wall that vanish. Eyes being stared into your soul. It's all okay. God is above watching over us all. God isn't always here but he's always on time.
How to get over it is just accept that if there's a face looking at you then theres a face looking at you. If you see another human being then that's a different story. Grab your weapon and phone and call the police or something. If you saw a ghost then just accept it and just say I forgive you then go back to sleep.
It's okay to be scared of things like that. Everyone will be scared of the unknown. Just remember that giving up is not an option.

Did I damage my brain? I strike my forehead really hard with my palm several times because I was having bad insomnia, and the palm bone above the wrist made contact with it, felt a bit sore on the forehead afterwards
No you certainly did not cause brain damage. But if you consistently and repeatedly hit your head it can cause some sort of damage because it is shaking the equilibrium inside your ear which can cause dizziness, and vertigo. But if you hit your head a few times 1 every week or so then you would be fine. That's why professional boxer get hit in the face and nothing major happens unless they get knocked out. So you wouldn't need to worry. What you should worry about is the insomnia.

What does the bite of a brown recluse spider look like after 24 hours?
Red, puffy, puss leakage, purple, bleeding, pain, burning, to a needle like pain. It really depends on how much the spider injected its venom. Likes it's possible for someone to get bit by a black widow and live because the black widow doesn't inject its venom it just bites. But spider does bite with venom I'd say seek medical attention.
1- Cut the blood circulation from the rest of the body.
2- suck out the venom if possible
3- apply ice to slow the movement of blood flow and venom
4- bandage and take off the tool used to cut blood circulation.
5. Head to the hospital.
Or.
Just head to the hospital that's literally the best option.

Are the eyes and heart connected?
No everything is connected to the brain
The brain is the mediator for all things. When you see something your brain either saids these things.
1- Is it dangerous or safe
2- Is it nice, or mean
3- Is it sexy or ugly
4- Is it good or bad
A person judges the outside and then that create subconscious reaction to either make your heart pound faster or not.
Unless you are talking about if the eyes and heart are connected in a spiritual way as in you see and can tell a person is good or bad. Then absolutely.

Can I get used to sunlight so I don't sweat as much?
Sweat is caused by exerting energy which will cause the body to heat up and that creates sweat to cool down the body. So if your sweating a lot exercise more to the point, where as exerting energy won't heat your body any more.
Oh just have a Glas of ice cold refreshing water. So when your body heats up it heating up because of the cold water inside you.
I would research what creates sweat glands, and why do the body sweat. If you understand why then you can solve how and when.

*cue everyone saying ‚Äúcalories in, calories out‚Äù
So many different things factor into weight. Genetics, metabolism, medications, hormone levels‚Ä¶ it's rarely as simple as ‚Äúeat less‚Äù.
A really good example is myself. I struggled deeply with anorexia, and at my lowest weighed 105. I'm only 4'11‚Ä≥, so this is technically a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù bmi, but I was so weak and fragile. I only have one picture of myself during that time, and I look so sick.
That's me. I was 18 years old, but look like a child. I was wearing children's clothing, and they were still that baggy. I remained this weight for a year and a half, then in three months I went from that‚Ä¶
To this. 185 pounds, obese, but my diet never changed. So what did? I was put on birth control. Such a dramatic change in three months, entirely because of birth control. Now, people often say how I'm just not aware of what I was eating, but that's not true. How do I know? Because I got married and pregnant, and after having my son, my weight plummeted. I got pregnant only a month after stopping birth control, and had a net gain of 10 pounds until the day I gave birth. I had a huge appetite at first from breastfeeding as well, but I eat so much more now than I ever did at my heaviest.
Yet here I am, 140 pounds and healthier than I ever was at 105 or 185, eating more than I was at both. I'm never going back on birth control. But here's your proof, ‚Äúcalories in, calories out‚Äù is a gross oversimplification that doesn't take into account the fact that bodies mess up and don't always work like they should.

The age of adulthood privileges should all be the same. I joined the army at 17, but couldn't legally drink, vote, play the lottery, buy any car, home, get a hotel room, or even sign forms to go on school trips or get Tylenol from the school nurse. I'm 21 and still can't get some hotel rooms. That's insane to me. If someone can join the military, they're mature enough to vote and do all the above listed things. On the flipside, if they're not old enough to get a hotel or vote, they're not mature enough to join the military.

What does it feel like to be skinny after being fat?
It feels odd. Granted, I wasn't always fat. I used to be extremely thin, courtesy of an eating disorder. Once I started birth control, my weight skyrocketed. Then I got pregnant and had my son, and now I'm at a healthy weight. Having been on both extremes, it's odd but nice to be healthy. I can walk upstairs and run without being totally winded, and I can stand up without having to worry about passing out. I've lived the dangers of both ends.

I can't love this enough or hate this enough because it shouldn't be like this. In the depths of my eating disorder, I went from 130 to 105 to 185 and back down again.

How do partners feel if you gain weight?
Less than a year after my husband and I started dating, I was prescribed birth control, which caused me to go from an unhealthily low weight (caused by an eating disorder) to obese in 3 months. I gained 80 pounds in 3 months. He never loved me any less, obviously we're married. I got pregnant immediately after stopping birth control and had our son in July, and am now down to a healthy weight for my body. I lost 50 pounds very quickly after giving birth. My husband never loved me any less when I was bigger. However, he's very attracted to my confidence now.

I was fine with my husband eating (not just because he's diabetic), but also, have some grace. That recliner was a whole lot more comfortable than my hospital bed, I slept in it after giving birth while my husband slept on the pull out futon. I understand it's boring, but surely it's understandable that a woman giving birth might not be the most compassionate. After 30+ hours of labor that ended in a c-section, I was quite grumpy.

Understand that practically nobody goes to every different specialist that exists. For example, I have a decent number of health problems, and I see a general practitioner (who manages my thyroid and feminine health), a psychiatrist, and a gastrointestinal doctor. General practitioners often manage mild issues, but if I have a severe problem, I'd much rather see someone who knows a lot about what's wrong.

What is it like to have an eating disorder?
Every fiber of your being revolves around it. I get on the scale and see the number drop. Good, but not good enough. I tell myself that I'll stop restricting when I am thin enough‚Ä¶ what an enormous lie. I know that there's no such thing as thin enough. I'm still considered obese, and I tell myself that's reason enough to starve myself. I just had my son 2 months ago. I only gained 20 pounds while pregnant, telling myself the entire pregnancy that I can start restricting when I give birth. I'm currently 45 pounds down from where I was the day before I gave birth. I like it when my husband is at work when I should be eating breakfast, because then no one will know that I didn't eat.

You have to just be honest with them. Ask them if they can talk, at a time when they're not busy, and say bluntly, ‚ÄúI don't want to do gymnastics anymore"". I know it's scary, but open communication goes a long way.

What might you do if you saw a Trump supporter accidentally drop their EBT card?
‚ÄúHey, it looks like you dropped this! Here you go!‚Äù
It's pretty simple. Be kind.

How do I make my stepdad understand that my tics are involuntarily? He keeps telling me it's ''a choice I make''.
Have him come to the doctor with you, or if he refuses, have the doctor call him and talk with him directly. What is your mom doing in all this? He's her husband, she shouldn't allow him to invalidate and blame her child. If nothing helps, know that the problem is not with you. You are doing nothing wrong, and you don't have to deal with people like him forever. Hang in there!

BPD actually has a really high success rate with treatment!! One of the biggest issues with the way personality disorders are perceived is that we only hear about the worst cases, which often have little to do with the disorder and a lot to do with the person just being a jerk. We don't often hear about people with these disorders who live normal, happy lives, even though it does happen. I have been diagnosed with BPD, I don't meet the criteria anymore, and I'd say I have a pretty typical life. I'm happily married and pregnant with our first child, I'm currently a housewife and will be a stay-at-home mom when our baby is born. I definitely don't match the stereotypical pwBPD. However, I imagine that many more people with personality disorders have average lives like I do than social media would make it seem. Treatment is effective, remission is possible!

I don't think anyone should be shamed for their bodies, especially since a lot of overweight/obese people only weigh so much due to medical conditions. The answer is not always ‚Äúeat less and exercise more"". For instance, I am considered obese because within three months of starting birth control, I gained 80 pounds, going from 105 to 185. If someone told me to eat less and exercise more, I would rightfully be angry, because that's not why I weigh so much.
However, that said, being overweight/obese is still never a good thing. The BMI is garbage, but there's no way to be 400 pounds without having problems. Pretending that being obese causes no issues would be ignorant. Obesity shouldn't be promoted, but the core problems need to be addressed, not just ‚Äúeat less, exercise more"". To do that, doctors need to actually do tests to figure out why someone is overweight, which few do.

Is 24 too late to get married?
Age shouldn't even be part of the equation when considering marriage (except you should obviously be an adult). There are 80-year-olds who aren't at all ready for marriage and 18-year-olds who are completely ready, and the other way around. So this question doesn't have a yes/no answer because age doesn't mean anything with regards to how ready you are to be married.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I can definitely say, your daughter was stressed for a longer span than you expected! And now she‚Äôs opening up as she could not take this misery by herself anymore! All she needs now is to be understood! You may question ‚ÄúHey, you can‚Äôt say that! I‚Äôve been supplying my daughter with whatever she asks for multiple years now! And how come she run deficit for happiness? When I provide her all that she wanted?‚Äù Or you may even question: I‚Äôve checked on my daughter asking ‚ÄòHow Are You?‚Äô to which she replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine!‚Äù In reality ‚ÄúIm fine‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù it‚Äôs just an escape reply we youths/ teens say immediately! And obviously your ward would neglect to talk about how she is feeling, it‚Äôs not because she thinks you can‚Äôt understand her! But it is that you are checking on her on the wrong‚Ä¶

I found out my son (12-year-old) watches anime. How should I react?
I would say it depends on what anime he is watching. There are many great animes, but there are some that are more adult. So I would say to keep an eye on that, but other than that, anime is great!^^

Everyone deals with stuff differently but an artist could express how they feel through their art, and that could help lift something of off their shoulders. It can feel good getting it out and making something visual of how you feel.

Who is going to be the next big thing after BTS and Twice?
I don‚Äôt think anyone will surpass the popularity of BTS, as it is truly one of a kind. Like the beatles, something that happens so little. But there are many 4th gen groups that are so talented that could lead in popularity. For example; ITZY, ATEEZ, TXT, EVERGLOW and many more. Only time will tell but there are many groups with potential.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Just because someone has ‚Äònever shown symptoms‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have any. Mental health can be sneaky and hidden quite well depending on the person. Many of those whom suffer with mental health issues, suffer in silence and that most likely ends in crisis (suicide or attempts). It can also be quite isolating and horrible. Please believe her, and get her some professional help before it manifests into something even worse. Take the fact that she has told you as a warning sign please. She trusted you enough to tell you she was struggling, please take it seriously and believe her. Mental health manifests in different ways and affects people differently.

Hey, thanks for this! As i write this i currently reside in a cough cough sewerslide room where I‚Äôve been having my blanket pulled on, my thigh caressed THROUGH several sheets, felt something pull on me, and lay beside me in bed. I‚Äôm not religious but I‚Äôm really curious if, in your exp, doing these things while NOT being religious can bring more harm than good? Also, ignore the other person below, smh. Always pushing it on us man. Crazy. Anywho, is it smart to do this with more than one person? I‚Äôm like, horrified I‚Äôd mess this up lmao.

Can you develop a crush on someone you've never met, or have only communicated with through writing?
Oh 100% dude!
I myself am in a long distance relationship currently. Met him through something silly, crushed on him before I even knew what he looked like, and damn did I score in both personality and looks.
I definitely believe you can crush on someone through writing.

My mother touches my 7 year old brother inappropriately. Our family knows about it and they think that it is normal, but I have realised how wrong it is. What should I do?
PLEASE stop this while you can, before he‚Äôs extremely scarred.
Call CPS, and if that doesn‚Äôt work try to record it for proof and send it to the police.

As someone who's currently in therapy for a lot of stuff, it might be best for you to try and join some kind of therapy, whether it is online, in person or in groups!

My kid said something incredibly racist to a person of colour at school. How do I handle this?
I think a good thing to do would be to try and find out where they learned these things. Is this from bad influences? Are kids pushing them be a bully/harasser?
Id suggest sitting down or forcing them to watch racial documentaries/read that stuff as a learning experience‚Ä¶

Some people think I'm crazy or autistic while I'm not. What should I do?
Hm I‚Äôm really not sure, but do know that from me (someone who ISN‚ÄôT diagnosed but Is very likely autistic) that it really isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs all in how you process things. I would have embarrassing meltdowns at school because of how things triggered me in a sensey way, and just- overall I was very hyper and a bit set back even in middle school.

Why would a child cry after being asked if an adult touched her?

If a child is crying after being asked that they might have read your tones wrong- maybe they thought they‚Äôd get into trouble if they said yes‚Ä¶ Maybe the adult said they deserved it, you never know unfortunately :( but‚Ä¶ I think they might just be very unsure of how to respond if they don‚Äôt know what will happen afterwards, but please note I don‚Äôt know much about psychology, I‚Äôm just trying to see it from a victim to possible victim approach if that makes sense‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs the best canvas size on procreate for digital art?
I think this VERY MUCH differs between people, but one of my favorites is a straight up square for headshot paintings. It gives me an even amount of space and it oddly feels good to use a square. However that‚Äôs not always gonna be the case, it really depends on what you draw. If you do landscapes I highly recommend long canvases to let it stretch out and such, but other than maybe stick with something like 1400x1400 px. That‚Äôs what I do at least ^^
(Though, sometimes if I want to do something small I try 900x900)

Though I‚Äôd recommend trying to find TWO rocks since just one is a biiit unhealthy lol- but you‚Äôd get there! i also recommend trying to avoid too much dark stuff unless it really interests you, such as staying away from too many news stations and whatnot.

When did you realize your parents were bad at parenting?
When I was in middle school.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
It doesn't matter if you ‚Äúbelieve"" her. You also can't ‚Äúsee"" symptoms of someone else's mental state unless obviously severe. One, as a parent, it's your job to be supportive and loving even when you disagree. Maybe there are things your daughter can't or won't tell you or even know how to communicate to you what is going on in their mind. 2, you are not a professional (I'm assuming) so it's not your job to diagnose or tell her she's fine or nothing is wrong. You don't know. Some people are very aware of themselves but need support towards a better path. I know when I'm at my lowest and begin self care. Others don't know. Some people say they don't ‚Äúfeel fine"" but don't know how to communicate it or find out why they feel what they feel. Most importantly, by telling your daughter she is fin‚Ä¶

Is it reasonable to take away your 13-year-old daughter's electronics when she‚Äôs self-harming and do nothing else about it?
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT. you're taking away her only distractions from what's going in her mind. what's wrong with you? the first thing that should have come up in your head, after finding out that she self harms, is providing her professional help. by taking away her belongings you're not only putting her at a risk of self harming more but you're invading her privacy, you make yours look like a terrible parent and you're ruining your relationship with her. try to understand her and get. her. professional. help. self harming is a sign of mental health issues and at worst it may end in suicide. leave this poor girls belongings alone and show some empathy and basic human decency especially when she is your daughter. how is taking her stuff gonna help? care to explain? why are parents on this app so brainless

19 yo here. you have absolutely no idea how much it probably took her to tell you about this. she must be in a bad place if she decided to confess to you. people with mental health issues are good at masking symptoms and maybe you just didn't notice them or brushed them off. its absolutely ridiculous that you're questioning if you should let her see a therapist when she is literally asking for help. would you do the same if she would tell you that idk she has pain in her chest? you're being extremely ignorant. it doesn't matter if she is lying or not (probably not!), let her get help. at worst it may end in her ending her life :) I hate parents like that with absolute passion

Very well put in the response that everyone is upvoting. Your story hits so close to home, so much it felt like I was reading my own life.
Also, what some people don‚Äôt know is that some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can remain dormant in someone until they reach the age of around 18 years old I had read somewhere before. That is exactly what happened with my little brother. Amazing well behaved kid until he got that age and his schizophrenia was triggered.
PLEASE never ignore or downplay anyone‚Äôs cry or request for help.

You‚Äôll do it if you want and deal with wearing long sleeves after that. My attorney has complete full sleeves on both arms, which I never knew of until he disclosed that information to me. In all of my past experiences having to do with court and attorneys, it‚Äôs rare that I‚Äôve seen an attorney going into court of in their office dressed down in a tank top or short sleeve, male or female. I am a female who happens to have my face, arms and hands tattooed while working in both corporate and private industries where appearance is very important and tattoos are frowned upon. I cover them with makeup and or the appropriate clothing. Easy, simple and done.

Help regarding my JAC Delhi counseling. According to last year's cutoffs, my options are IGDTUW CSAI, NSUT MAC, NSUT EIOT, DTU ECE, and IIITD ECE. I don't know coding yet. What would be the best choice?
Hi,
If you want to go into coding, I would say go for IGDTUW CSA or NSIT for software-related branches.

What should I prefer if I want to crack the UPSC in the future, DTU chemical engineering or IGDTUW CSE?
A2A
My friend in CS has been preparing for UPSC since 2015. He recently joined a company as a Software Developer, almost 3 years after graduating.
He was only preparing for these 3 years. A few months back he told me he wanted to have something in hand because of which he started working. He is still preparing for UPSC.
As appealing as it seems, to go for an easier degree, I would recommend having something strong as a backup as it will give you confidence while you are in the process for UPSC.
Consider all factors and then make a decision. All the best, future officer :)

If you want to pursue a Master‚Äôs- go for a CS degree. If not, you can go for NSUT and experience studying in a Tier 1 college. You mostly learn coding on your own. All the best.

My opinion- I wouldn‚Äôt recommend so. It‚Äôs better to get into a decent college and work on your skills than running after a brand name and wasting your time.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Take her to a Therapist is what you do. If you honestly think your kid would come to you and lie about her mental problems especially when there‚Äôs nothing to get out of it you‚Äôre wrong. Hundreds of thousands just in America die from suicide each year, and it‚Äôs partly because of this right here. People reach out for help and no one answers, or they battle their own internal demons until they either miraculously get over it or they commit or attempt suicide. Your kid is coming to you of all people, because you‚Äôre her mother and she trusts you to help her out. No matter what the mental health issue it can always progress and become worse. Coming from someone who has lost countless friends to this, and attempted suicide, step up and save your child‚Äôs life while you still have the chance. The f‚Ä¶

Absolutely not, the narrative that being in your late 30s makes you old and needing to be ‚Äùsuccessful‚Äù is hardly realistic unless you come from money or extremely successful with a business. You‚Äôre barely starting life also successful has different meaning to everyone who cares if you‚Äôre not ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù to capitalism‚Äôs standards. You can do anything you put your mind to just remember to reward yourself and take care/listen to your body ‚ù§Ô∏è wishing the best of success happiness and life ‚ú®

I mean if it helps them who cares ?? If they are still able to function and complete their daily tasks without any problems . Everyone has their vices, they could be doing much worse things such as abusing pills or alcohol (aka fire water) , I‚Äôve been smoking for 10 years and yes you can abuse cannabis but it‚Äôs more if you‚Äôre lazy cannabis will enhance that if not they will be fine. Cannabis is a naturally grown plant that doesn‚Äôt even have to be smoked there‚Äôs many ways to use it ! I hope you‚Äôre not shaming your partner for partaking in it either.

My best friend never asked to help because of how you think mental struggles work. My best friend committed suicide because her mother ignored her pleas to get help. She was suffering for many years. If she would have went to therapy she would have been able to get the treatment she needed may have even been alive today she would have been 21 this year. If your child is feeling safe enough to ask for help be a good listener and do it. Don‚Äôt care if therapy makes you uncomfortable it‚Äôs for your child you make sacrifices to make sure they know they are loved. Maybe she‚Äôs completely fine but just having a therapist to talk to can be helpful or maybe she is actually struggling really hard and she‚Äôs worried so she‚Äôs asking for help. Either way it‚Äôs better safe than sorry.

It is STUNNING, but it really doesn't matter what we think. This is the bride's special day and her opinion and feeling is the only one who matters. This is her and her future husband's day, nobody else's. I say this because I have seen people post things like this and then say to the bride, ‚ÄúYou see. Everyone else loves it, she should definitely wear this. ‚Äú If it is not the bride's vision for her bridal party, it should not happen and the beautiful young lady should wear the dress to a different event. If the bride loves it for her wedding, then ypur daughter should absolutely wear it. She looks beautiful!

No. I am going to be a different voice. If you are not comfortable raising her, than you should not. As a psychiatric nurse, the trauma this could bring to that child could be immeasurable if going to a home where she is unwanted. It coukd also bring trauma to you. If the grandmother is that concerned, she should take the child herself. Obviously, there is not enough information to deem why the actual mother shouldn't be the one raising her. Does the grandma think the mother is ‚Äúunfit‚Äù? Does the grandma just think you are more fiscally sound than the child's mother? What is the reasoning? This is no simple question and answer without more details.details. A child should ALWAYS be kept with the parent unless there are extenuating circumstances where the child's welfare is in question.

If you have schizophrenia, can you still get psychosis?
Yes. Schizophrenia is the disease and psychosis is a possible effect. For example, not everyone who has depression is suicidal. You can be suicidal one moment and not have a diagnosis of depression. It is similar with psychosis. Not everyone with psychosis is schizophrenic. It can be triggered by many different things including drug use, trauma, bipolar disorder, etc. I have had patients in psychosis from many reasons.

I am a psychiatric nurse and this is a well written, factual response. It always saddens me when I see someone come back after stopping their medications because they thought they were cured. Unfortunately, there is no cure. Many people live happy, productive lives while on medication and end up losing everything after stopping them. Also, these medications are not something that should be stopped cold turkey. Many need to be tapered under medical supervision. Please consult with your doctor before making any changes and educate yourself. Ask them for resources to learn more about the things you should know. Good luck.

I have schizophrenia. Can I know who I am with this illness?
You are you. I would recommend getting yourself a good provider to start you on medication to keep it under control. It can be controlled with diligence and upkeep. You CAN live a normal life if you choose to. Your choices you make are up to you, but starting with diligent followup when you are young will lead to better outcomes. Good luck!

Please get your daughter the help she is asking for. I am a mental health/ER nurse and too many times we get patients in post suicide attempt. Many times it could have been avoided had someone taken them seriously. Remember, people let you see what they want you to see. Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there. Teenagers have a much harder time than we did. They have social media and technology that we never did. We used to go outside and do anything we wanted as long as we were home before the street lights came on. Kids nowadays are sheltered because of the predators and are not able to experience the learning experiences and independence we did as children. Cut her some slack and be thankful she came to you.

Did the US Military fully abandon jungle warfare training during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (GWOT) or was the capability to fight in jungles still maintained only by SOF units like Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, Rangers, and JSOC units?
Nope. We did not abandon this skillset and trained it throughout the GWOT and continue to train it today. Your training, as a platoon/maneuver unit, is largely directed toward where you are deploying, however, as a community, we still have commitments in the southeast region, and some maneuver units are required to train to a higher level of proficiency for these areas.

What you need to do at this point is build up your physical condition enough to crush the physical screen test standards. If you don‚Äôt know what they are, you are already behind the power curve. There is so much information out there now on how to prepare for BUD/S, etc. that it is up to you to sift it all out and put in the work. If you aren‚Äôt committed enough to do this, you will never make it through the pipeline. In addition to this, commit yourself to making straight As in High School and join a team sport. Making good grades takes discipline and learning how to be an asset to your team will help you immensely.

When it comes to training the body for ""battle"", we must first understand the demands of our chosen sport, profession, and lifestyle we live. From here, we should engage in the activities that will condition us for these demands.
Physical training is stress applied to the body to force an adaptation
The SAID principle states that a Specific Adaptation will occur on the body from an Imposed Demand. Our body will adapt to the frequent stresses placed upon it. The more specific the stressor, the more specific the adaptation.
If you want to become strong, you have to frequently lift heavy or perform movements that are progressively more taxing on the Central Nervous System (CNS). If you want to increase your ability to perform Pull-ups, you have to do more Pull-ups, etc. This concept isn't complicated but achieving your goals based on the demands of your sport and or profession can be if you do not approach objective-based programming correctly.
Physical conditioning serves two purposes
The first purpose is to strengthen and condition the body for work (as briefly explained in the previous section). What we do inside or outside of the gym for training must translate to what we need to be capable of.
The second purpose is to toughen up the mind. Physical training is a positive form of stress and If appropriately utilized, can be leveraged as a tool for stress management. We can also use physical training to strengthen the mind to handle stress more effectively in a controlled setting.
An individual who is physically fit will be physically resilient and more mentally stable in stressful situations as a result. Under stress, being physically exhausted bleeds into our decision-making process and hampers our ability to focus and stay on point.
Fitness leads to confidence in stressful situations
Physical conditioning is a key component to being as effective as possible in any endeavor. The more physically fit you are, the sharper your mind can be, and the more energy you have at your disposal to commit to whatever you are doing.
I recognized early in my career the value of being physically hard and capable of the demands of warfighting (training and combat operations downrange). Not only does being extremely physically fit lead to confidence but also respect from your peers within the special operations community. This motivated me to be as physically conditioned as possible.
The fitter I was, the better I felt, and the easier my job became in training and during combat. This high degree of physical readiness also helped provide me with the confidence needed to focus mentally.
My pursuit of fitness led me to increase my personal knowledge of exercise science and learn the latest and greatest techniques and strategies employed by professionals within the strength and conditioning industry to achieve higher levels of physical fitness.
Physical conditioning and warfighting
In special operations (and in warfighting in general), we never want our tactics, techniques, and procedures negatively affected due to a lack of fitness. Once the body breaks down, the mind becomes strained, and our will and discipline also take a hit.
Combat is very difficult on the mind and body. The temperatures, terrain, emotional highs and lows, and the nature of killing or being killed take their toll (no matter who you are or how seasoned you may be).
Maneuver warfare is draining and oftentimes happens when an individual is already at a physical deficit (tired, dehydrated, and hungry). A soldier is required to patrol for prolonged distances under load in the elements and maneuver across arduous terrain to maintain a tactical advantage over the enemy. They are constantly subjected to the physical and emotional burdens of repeated bouts of heightened awareness while under fire and the adrenaline dumps accompanied by lulls in the fight.
As I reflect back on some of the specific combat operations I was a part of years ago while deployed overseas, I am reminded of the physical and mental strains I had experienced. I was very excited to load the helos in the middle of the night as they departed the airfield to insert into enemy-held territory.
I was definitely aware of the dangers of combat but was extremely grateful for the opportunity to do what we were trained to do and confident in our ability, as a team, to be successful in what we were doing. This trust was developed through countless hours of training and honing our operational skillsets while stateside and with each subsequent combat operation.
I wasn't angry, I wasn't bloodthirsty, and I wouldn't even say that I was obsessed with killing the enemy either. I wasn't any of those things. I strongly believed in the mission at the time and was willing to surrender my life to combat evil if that was God's will.
I didn't want to die, nor did I want to become wounded in combat but I longed to fight and prove myself as a valiant warrior against those who were bent on evil as they oppressed the innocent. My motives for serving were pure and back then, for me personally, it was pretty cut and dry.
I relied heavily upon my faith in Christ and I focused on doing my job to the best of my ability so that I didn't let any of my teammates down. I looked up to those men, I loved them and was humbled to serve alongside most of them. I say all of this to further highlight why physical conditioning was such a huge component of my preparation as a warrior. My purpose and reason for being fit were greater than self and I took this responsibility seriously.
Train the body for the demands of sport and profession through objective-based programming
In special operations, our physical training is heavily focused on meeting the demands of the job. This meant that the majority of our fitness training (at least 75%) had to effectively address the following...
Relative Strength - Strength relative to an individual's bodyweight
Kinesthetic Awareness - Ability to maintain control of one's body during movement through space
Muscular Strength Endurance - Maintain repeated efforts of moderately high amounts of force
Work Capacity - Anaerobic fitness and metabolic conditioning
Aerobic Capacity - Possessing a high degree of both aerobic and anaerobic fitness
Stamina - Ability to perform and recover from intense work across multiple days
Conditioning for the above attributes was non-negotiable and ultimately enabled us to be better operators.
Strength and endurance
Strength and endurance are two fitness attributes at opposite ends of the fitness spectrum because they both require completely different energy systems. Strength is anaerobic or ATP/CP specific and uses mostly carbs to fuel energy output, whereas endurance is aerobic or oxidative and utilizes a higher percentage of fats than carbs to provide energy.
Physical strength is very important to the operator, however, possessing insane levels of endurance is the most critical when fighting for prolonged periods of time in unforgiving environments. This translates to the physical capacity to push hard for longer durations wearing your operational kit through intense physical, mental, and emotional duress (extended patrol to the objective, multi-hour gunfights, working through contingencies and or mass casualty situations, and potential multi-day missions).
This ability requires a robust aerobic engine and remaining calm and focused in chaotic situations. Again, it takes a lot of mental bandwidth and energy to focus. It is much harder to do this when physically tapped out. Putting everything together and adequately preparing for these demands takes time, education, and discipline to remain consistent.
Prioritize and maintain objectives for more effective results in performance
Trying to increase both strength and endurance at the same time is inefficient (if not impossible). This is why periodization is so important to long-term gains in physical performance.
A better approach to improving both attributes over time is through periodization. For a specified period of time, aim to increase aerobic capacity while maintaining strength. After this period of time, transition to building strength while holding onto your aerobic capacity gains, etc.
With this approach, the majority of your energy reserves can go towards improving the desired attribute. Trying to increase both simultaneously will most likely lead to burnout and or injury.
Put your preferences to the side and train to be effective
If you wish to be ""battle ready"" and perform at your best, you must train according to the demands and rigors of your chosen profession, not your preferences. This will require you to venture outside of your comfort zone and will challenge your discipline. Maintaining consistency here will also increase your mental toughness and resilience.
You can still train according to preference or engage in the activities you enjoy, however, you need to ensure that the majority of your training is focused on improving the attributes that will make you better at your job or sport.
Optimal readiness periodized programming is initially geared towards establishing a high foundation of general physical and mental preparedness to help get you in the best shape possible.
Once this foundation is achieved, we build upon it through objective-based programming that will help you become more effective at what you do.

There are many definitions of what it means to be ready for battle because the are various contexts and metaphors for warfare. However, what I aim to accomplish over the next three posts is to clearly outline (to the best of my ability) what it means to be mentally, physically, and spiritually prepared for whatever battle/endeavor you are presented with in life.
Regardless of your chosen profession, sport, or lifestyle, being mentally sharp, physically conditioned, and spiritually strong will enable you to perform at the highest levels possible!
In this first installment of the ""Battle Ready"" series, I will break down how to effectively train the mind based on my past experiences.
Sharpening the sword
In military special operations, we often times referred to preparation for combat as ‚Äúsharpening the sword‚Äù. This brief phrase can be distilled down into the translation of honing our operational skillsets.
If I expand this translation, it encompasses training the mind to be good at what we do and smarter than our enemy, conditioning the body for the arduous work of special operations, and strengthening our fighting spirit to never give up and be prepared to lay down our lives for our teammates. Scripture tells us in John 15: 13, ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."" Sharpening the sword ultimately involves a mind, body, and spiritual approach to preparing for the known and unknown challenges of warfighting.
I understand that most people reading this post are not warfighters in the traditional sense. However, going back to my opening statement, regardless of what you do in life, figuring out how to translate mental, physical, and spiritual preparation to enhance your current endeavor is critical to performing at your best.
True health and fitness aren't one dimensional
All three components of preparation (mind, body, spirit) are integral aspects of readiness and performance. Each has a negative or positive effect on the other. The more fit you are in the physical sense, the better you are able to recover from stress, and the more cognitively efficient you can be in performing your duties and responsibilities. Your spiritual fitness, on the other hand, is necessary for tapping into your inner sources of strength. Being spiritually deficient negatively impacts your physical and mental resiliency.
Effectively training the mind
In special operations, we prepare the mind through the dedicated study and perfection of the skills associated with our craft along with our duties and responsibilities as members of a high-performing team.
Get good at what you do. For the operator, this includes honing the skills needed to be subject matter experts on the job. This encompasses the study of tactics, the development, and implementation of new tactics, techniques, and procedures, and ultimately honing these skill sets through high-risk training evolutions for adaptive performance.
This same principle applies to everyone no matter the role or responsibility. In order to do this effectively, we first need to broaden our awareness and understanding of our role and responsibility as it relates to what we are doing. The next step is to acquire as much knowledge as possible associated with our specific tactics, techniques, and procedures.
Learn from your mistakes and continue to refine the process of becoming a better... (fill in the blank). Take the time to identify ways in which you can be better at your current job. What specific attributes or skillsets do you need to learn or perfect in order to be the best that you can possibly be at your chosen profession?
Become a Subject Matter Expert (SME) by mastering the basic fundamentals of your required skill sets. You do not have a solid foundation to build upon until you become brilliant at the basics. Iteration training is the purposeful practice of skills and is step one of developing confidence and competence as an SME. This requires purposeful and quality repetition training to ensure efficiency through forward progress in developing your operational capacity.
For those of us familiar with shooting, what is a better option for improving our level of competence at this skill? Is it better to quickly shoot through 500 rounds of ammunition one time at the range, or is it more beneficial to take the time required to intentionally shoot one round five hundred times across multiple range days?
The answer is to purposefully execute the proper fundamentals needed to shoot each round with accuracy five hundred times. This is what I am talking about in terms of being smart and intentional with your training. As more time is spent applying the basics and fundamentals (regardless of the skill), you're able to adjust to mistakes made in performance, your speed of execution gradually increases because the nuanced steps associated with executing the skill become second nature, your movements smooth out, and your ability to mentally and physically process everything becomes faster.
Once these fundamentals become second nature, you increase your mental capacity to effectively learn more advanced skills and protocols. This is why, in the operational SEAL Teams, we always revisited the basics before moving on to the sexier and more complex skill sets (regardless of your ability level or time in the Teams).
Train how you intend to fight. In special operations, we frequently engage in realistic, scenario-based training with the intention of stress inoculation to learn valuable lessons from mistakes made. This is where you put the skills you have been honing throughout your iteration training to the test in a controlled environment where the stress and intensity are increased at the appropriate intensity levels over time.
This concept was conducted in the SEAL Teams through graded full mission profile training scenarios against a dynamic and fully equipped opposition force. We worked through stressful contingencies or worst-case scenarios and were thrust into uncomfortable situations and environments while under physical and mental duress. Due to the stressful nature of this training, mistakes were made and lessons were learned that prepared us for what could have been a reality downrange.
We reset, reflect upon the lessons learned, and then figure out how to prevent these same mistakes from happening in a similar future situation or scenario. Next, we then implement updated techniques, tactics, and procedures into our preparation to enhance our performance. This is a continuous cycle of what adequate preparation looks like in perfecting and applying your skillsets.
Effectively leverage performance psychology to increase performance. Another tool used to strengthen the mind is the proper application of mental skills. Some of these skills include Self-Talk, Mental Rehearsal, Goal Setting, and Energy Management (ability to control your physiological response to stress and your emotions).
These skills are designed to enable optimal performance in stressful situations and environments where we must control both our physiological and psychological responses to these stressors. However, these are not to be viewed as tools to solve all of our problems.
These mental skills will help you to perform at your best or to your true potential. They are not the substitution for a lack of preparation!
Conclusion
To be as effective as possible, we must take the time to train and engage our minds each and every day. You can do this through problem-solving, acquiring knowledge through reading, studying, brain-training games, puzzles, training your memory, and the dedicated practice of reflection and introspection after learning new concepts and ideas. This is an absolutely critical component to growing and becoming better each day.

One must learn how to leverage motivation and discipline to effectively achieve their goals and objectives.
Motivation is a feeling. It is an emotion that inspires us to take action. Making decisions purely based on emotion is a recipe for failure (no matter what we are doing).
When the going gets tough (and it will if the challenge is hard enough) motivation will abandon you EVERY TIME. This is important to know and understand. You need more than a fleeting emotion to endure the rigorous journey of your chosen endeavor.
Your reason for getting started must be deeper than an emotion. It must be filled with a strong sense of purpose.
Discipline, on the other hand, is doing what needs to be done regardless of the circumstance and how you feel. Discipline must be trained and developed just like any other skill and you do this by engaging in the things that must be done even when you don't feel like it.
One must not should NOT go through the motions but must be BE intentional about what they are doing (even when they‚Äôd rather be somewhere else doing something different) and focused throughout.
Discipline involves a sense of responsibility and is part of becoming mature and growing up.
In special operations, the discipline you train in preparation for war is the discipline that you will leverage when you need it the most downrange. This principle holds true for anyone and everyone. If you want to perform in the most difficult cirmstances/worst case scenario (respective to you the individual), then you need to develop the right mindset and attitude needed to drive your preparation.
You need both motivation and discipline to be successful. You need passion and purpose and I would argue that discipline is more important.

Bodyweight Strength Training for the Advanced Athlete
Traditional strength training employs loaded movements in the form of powerlifting to train the central nervous system for gains in maximum tension and strength. strength.¬∂

The backbone of training for maximal raw strength is through four core lifts. These traditional lifts are the Deadlift, the Bench Press, the Back Squat, and the Military/Shoulder Press.
I aim to provide an alternative for the advanced-level athlete who desires to train strength in a similar fashion but with minimal equipment and without the need for a gym.
I will employ advanced bodyweight exercises to accomplish this goal. The purpose of these specific exercises is to develop functional and transferable strength and neuromuscular coordination.
These movements require strength and kinesthetic awareness not found in traditional barbell (BB) or dumbbell (DB) exercises making them a very functional and versatile alternative to traditional strength training. They are excellent for increasing raw strength, athleticism, and coordination.
Below are the movements and ways to utilize the appropriate levels of assistance for each exercise depending on your current ability level. Visit the Exercise Library for a visual demonstration of each exercise.
UPPER BODY PUSH MUSCULATURE
1. Single-Arm Push-ups:
Perform the movement with the hand of your working arm elevated on a bench, countertop, box, etc. if you are not strong enough in this movement to perform 5 clean and crisp, chest-to-deck reps for each arm. The height of the platform is dependent upon current strength and fitness.
2. Handstand Push-ups (HSPUs):
If HSPUs are too difficult, place a weight plate or a stack of weight plates, books, etc. between both hands and lower your head to the stack to cut down the range of motion. Over time, lower the stack in relation to the deck until you are able to perform legitimate HSPUs touching the top of your head to the ground each rep.
If the prescribed number of reps each set/round is too easy, perform deficit reps (hands elevated on stacked weight plates, ammo cans, etc. to extend the range of motion) or slow down the rep tempo to the point where the reps are ‚Äúhard‚Äù but doable each set.
3. Deficit Shoulder or Pike Push-ups w/ feet elevated:
Another way to safely strengthen the muscles of the shoulder girdle is through the Shoulder Push-up. The traditional Shoulder Push-up with feet elevated on a bench or box is not enough to develop raw strength for the advanced athlete, however, performing very slow and controlled deficit reps with each hand elevated on a myriad of stable or unstable surfaces can be. The Deficit Shoulder Push-up w/ feet elevated is an outstanding movement for developing functional and transferable strength, flexibility, and stability of the shoulder complex and one that should be performed on a regular basis.
CORE MUSCULATURE
1. Hanging Leg Raises w/ shins to the bar:
If raising your shins to the bar is too difficult to perform, cut down the range of motion, and bring both legs up to waist level so that they are straight and parallel to the deck. You must keep both legs as straight as possible and perform each rep with a controlled tempo for the best results and for adaptations in strength to occur.
More volume accumulated through subsequent training sessions will eventually lead to the adequate strength needed to perform the exercise as prescribed. The form is key though! No swinging and ensure both legs are kept as straight as possible throughout the movement of each rep. Keep a hollow core with your hip flexors flexed while at the bottom position of the movement for best results.
2. L Sit Isometric Holds:
Perform both Hanging L Sit and Parallel Bar L Sit Isometric Holds in order to develop strength through maximum tension in your core flexors and stabilizers. This exercise is brutal but very crucial for developing true core strength and stabilization.
If the standard movement is too difficult, perform the Knee Tuck Isometric Hold as a substitute.
UPPER BODY PULL MUSCULATURE
1. Single-Arm Inverted Rows:
Perform the movement with legs straight and heels on the deck at shoulder-width apart if possible or with knees bent and feet flat on the deck for an easier variation. The hardest version would be to perform the movement with both feet elevated off the deck at roughly the same height as the bar or ring. This variation of the movement will take consistent practice and requires serious strength development.
2. Single-Arm Assisted Chin-ups:
Perform the movement one of two ways:
Utilize a towel, rope, strap, or rubber band for assistance. Grip the towel with the hand of your non-working arm at the face, neck, chest, or stomach level from an extended arm starting position or hang. Where you grip the towel depends upon your current level of strength. The lower you grip the towel in relation to the bar the harder the single-arm assisted chin-up becomes. Really focus on the eccentric or negative phase of the movement for best results in strength adaptations. Do not just let gravity take over on the way down, really fight during the negative portion of the movement. This is where the majority of the gains in strength are made.
Utilize the required number of fingers gripping the bar for assistance from your non-working arm. Over time, use fewer fingers until you are able to perform the movement without any assistance from your non-working arm. For example, grip the bar like normal with your right arm and grip the bar with one or two fingers from your left hand close to your body for the appropriate assistance.
3. Loaded Pull-ups/Chin-ups and Inverted Rows:
These upper-body pull staple exercises can be utilized for strength by adding load to each movement via a weighted belt and or vest for Pull-ups/Chin-ups and a weighted vest for Inverted Rows.
Adding a load to these movements is only recommended once the individual athlete can safely perform the exercise for 15 perfect, full range of motion repetitions. Until then, utilizing isometric holds/pauses and increased time under tension techniques is the preferred approach to increasing strength in these movements.
LOWER BODY PULL MUSCULATURE
6. Single Leg Squat or Loaded Single Leg Box Squat:
If you are unable to perform 5 clean and crisp legitimate single-leg squats with the thigh of your working leg slightly below parallel to the deck, perform single-leg box squats at the lowest box possible.
Execute the Single-Leg Box Squat movement by sitting down on a box or platform while maintaining full control throughout. You will then stand back up from a dead-stop position using one leg. The height of the platform is dependent upon current strength and fitness. Gradually lower the height of the box over time. More volume accumulated through subsequent training sessions will eventually lead to adequate strength needed to perform the exercise as prescribed.
Both Single Leg Squats and Single-Leg Box Squats are programmed throughout advanced training plans for developing strength in the legs.
Another way to train the Single-Leg Box Squat is by adding load. For Loaded Single Leg Box Squats, use a platform that is higher (for less depth) than the platform you use for unloaded Single Leg Box Squats. Less squat depth will ensure heavier loads throughout the movement.
Another option to help you execute the movement a little easier is to hold a weight with both hands and arms straight in front of you to serve as a counterbalance. This weight can be in the form of a dumbbell, weight plate, medicine ball, etc. The weight of the load is determined by your strength and fitness levels.
Perform these exercises utilizing the appropriate variation or level of assistance for the prescribed rep range and progress from there. You should perform the movements feeling as strong as possible and avoid muscle failure for the best results.
The desired adaptation is absolute strength in these movements so ensure that you take adequate rest breaks between sets and rounds so that you are as strong as possible and on the attack. Don‚Äôt be afraid to rest upwards of around 5 minutes between sets or rounds in some cases. Be patient and be consistent with your progress throughout the program for the best results.

Another option to help you execute the movement a little easier is to hold a weight with both hands and arms straight in front of you to serve as a counterbalance. This weight can be in the form of a dumbbell, weight plate, medicine ball, etc. The weight of the load is determined by your strength and fitness levels.
Perform these exercises utilizing the appropriate variation or level of assistance for the prescribed rep range and progress from there. You should perform the movements feeling as strong as possible and avoid muscle failure for the best results.
The desired adaptation is absolute strength in these movements so ensure that you take adequate rest breaks between sets and rounds so that you are as strong as possible and on the attack. Don‚Äôt be afraid to rest upwards of around 5 minutes between sets or rounds in some cases. Be patient and be consistent with your progress throughout the program for the best results.

Bodyweight Strength Training for the Advanced Athlete
Traditional strength training employs loaded movements in the form of powerlifting to train the central nervous system for gains in maximum tension and strength. The backbone of training for maximal raw strength is through four core lifts. These traditional lifts are the Deadlift, the Bench Press, the Back Squat, and the Military/Shoulder Press.
I aim to provide an alternative for the advanced-level athlete who desires to train strength in a similar fashion but with minimal equipment and without the need for a gym.
I will employ advanced bodyweight exercises to accomplish this goal. The purpose of these specific exercises is to develop functional and transferable strength and neuromuscular coordination.
These movements require strength and kinesthetic awareness not found in traditional barbell (BB) or dumbbell (DB) exercises making them a very functional and versatile alternative to traditional strength training. They are excellent for increasing raw strength, athleticism, and coordination.
Below are the movements and ways to utilize the appropriate levels of assistance for each exercise depending on your current ability level. Visit the Exercise Library for a visual demonstration of each exercise.
UPPER BODY PUSH MUSCULATURE
1. Single-Arm Push-ups:
Perform the movement with the hand of your working arm elevated on a bench, countertop, box, etc. if you are not strong enough in this movement perform 5 clean and crisp, chest-to-deck reps for each arm. The height of the platform is dependent upon current strength and fitness.
2. Handstand Push-ups (HSPUs):
If HSPUs are too difficult, place a weight plate or a stack of weight plates, books, etc. between both hands and lower your head to the stack to cut down the range of motion. Over time, lower the stack in relation to the deck until you are able to perform legitimate HSPUs touching the top of your head to the ground each rep.
If the prescribed number of reps each set/round is too easy, perform deficit reps (hands elevated on stacked weight plates, ammo cans, etc. to extend the range of motion) or slow down the rep tempo to the point where the reps are ‚Äúhard‚Äù but doable each set.
3. Deficit Shoulder or Pike Push-ups w/ feet elevated:
Another way to safely strengthen the muscles of the shoulder girdle is through the Shoulder Push-up. The traditional Shoulder Push-up with feet elevated on a bench or box is not enough to develop raw strength for the advanced athlete, however, performing very slow and controlled deficit reps with each hand elevated on a myriad of stable or unstable surfaces can be. The Deficit Shoulder Push-up w/ feet elevated is an outstanding movement for developing functional and transferable strength, flexibility, and stability of the shoulder complex and one that should be performed on a regular basis.
CORE MUSCULATURE
1. Hanging Leg Raises w/ shins to the bar:
If raising your shins to the bar is too difficult to perform, cut down the range of motion, and bring both legs up to waist level so that they are straight and parallel to the deck. You must keep both legs as straight as possible and perform each rep with a controlled tempo for the best results and for adaptations in strength to occur.
More volume accumulated through subsequent training sessions will eventually lead to the adequate strength needed to perform the exercise as prescribed. The form is key though! No swinging and ensure both legs are kept as straight as possible throughout the movement of each rep. Keep a hollow core with your hip flexors flexed while at the bottom position of the movement for best results.
2. L Sit Isometric Holds:
Perform both Hanging L Sit and Parallel Bar L Sit Isometric Holds in order to develop strength through maximum tension in your core flexors and stabilizers. This exercise is brutal but very crucial for developing true core strength and stabilization.
If the standard movement is too difficult, perform the Knee Tuck Isometric Hold as a substitute.
UPPER BODY PULL MUSCULATURE
1. Single-Arm Inverted Rows:
Perform the movement with legs straight and heels on the deck at shoulder-width apart if possible or with knees bent and feet flat on the deck for an easier variation. The hardest version would be to perform the movement with both feet elevated off the deck at roughly the same height as the bar or ring. This variation of the movement will take consistent practice and requires serious strength development.
2. Single-Arm Assisted Chin-ups:
Perform the movement one of two ways:
Utilize a towel, rope, strap, or rubber band for assistance. Grip the towel with the hand of your non-working arm at the face, neck, chest, or stomach level from an extended arm starting position or hang. Where you grip the towel depends upon your current level of strength. The lower you grip the towel in relation to the bar the harder the single-arm assisted chin-up becomes. Really focus on the eccentric or negative phase of the movement for best results in strength adaptations. Do not just let gravity take over on the way down, really fight during the negative portion of the movement. This is where the majority of the gains in strength are made.
Utilize the required number of fingers gripping the bar for assistance from your non-working arm. Over time, use fewer fingers until you are able to perform the movement without any assistance from your non-working arm. For example, grip the bar like normal with your right arm and grip the bar with one or two fingers from your left hand close to your body for the appropriate assistance.
3. Loaded Pull-ups/Chin-ups and Inverted Rows:
These upper-body pull staple exercises can be utilized for strength by adding load to each movement via a weighted belt and or vest for Pull-ups/Chin-ups and a weighted vest for Inverted Rows.
Adding a load to these movements is only recommended once the individual athlete can safely perform the exercise for 15 perfect, full range of motion repetitions. Until then, utilizing isometric holds/pauses and increased time under tension techniques is the preferred approach to increasing strength in these movements.
LOWER BODY PULL MUSCULATURE
6. Single Leg Squat or Loaded Single Leg Box Squat:
If you are unable to perform 5 clean and crisp legitimate single-leg squats with the thigh of your working leg slightly below parallel to the deck, perform single-leg box squats at the lowest box possible.
Execute the Single-Leg Box Squat movement by sitting down on a box or platform while maintaining full control throughout. You will then stand back up from a dead-stop position using one leg. The height of the platform is dependent upon current strength and fitness. Gradually lower the height of the box over time. More volume accumulated through subsequent training sessions will eventually lead to adequate strength needed to perform the exercise as prescribed.
Both Single Leg Squats and Single-Leg Box Squats are programmed throughout advanced training plans for developing strength in the legs.
Another way to train the Single-Leg Box Squat is by adding load. For Loaded Single Leg Box Squats, use a platform that is higher (for less depth) than the platform you use for unloaded Single Leg Box Squats. Less squat depth will ensure heavier loads throughout the movement.
Another option to help you execute the movement a little easier is to hold a weight with both hands and arms straight in front of you to serve as a counterbalance.

One must learn how to leverage motivation and discipline to effectively achieve their goals and objectives.
Motivation is a feeling. It is an emotion that inspires us to take action. Making decisions purely based on emotion is a recipe for failure (no matter what we are doing).
When the going gets tough (and it will if the challenge is hard enough) motivation will abandon you EVERY TIME. This is important to know and understand. You need more than a fleeting emotion to endure the rigorous journey of your chosen endeavor.
Your reason for getting started must be deeper than an emotion. It must be filled with a strong sense of purpose.
Discipline, on the other hand, is doing what needs to be done regardless of the circumstance and how you feel. Discipline must be trained and developed just like any other skill and you do this by engaging in the things that must be done even when you don't feel like it.
One must not go through the motions but must be intentional about what they are doing (even when they‚Äôd rather be somewhere else doing something different) and focused throughout.
Discipline involves a sense of responsibility and is part of becoming mature and growing up.
In special operations, the discipline you train in preparation for war is the discipline that you will leverage when you need it the most downrange.
You need both motivation and discipline to be successful. You need passion and purpose and I would argue that discipline is more important.

What are some army training programs or routines that would be beneficial to my health & fitness goals (lose weight)?
To effectively lose body fat and build relative strength (strength to bodyweight ratio), one of the best ways is through a total body training plan using your bodyweight as the primary means of resistance.
You want to perform a total body strength training routine 2‚Äì4x per week in addition to 2‚Äì4 cardio training sessions as well.
These cardio sessions should include both interval training and some form of long slow distance.
Walk every day as well.

How can I start doing push-ups if I can't even do one proper one now?
Assume the Front Lean and Rest position with your hands elevated on a table top, counter top, bench, chair, box, etc. The height should be proportionate to your strength and ability level. Perform 3 sets x 8‚Äì12 reps with 1 minute rest between sets.
Once you can achieve this, lower the platform and then perform 4 sets x 6‚Äì8 reps.
Again, once you can achieve this standard, lower the platform and perform 5 sets x 5 reps.

What has the hardest training in the world, the Navy SEAL or the Marine?
That question entirely depends upon the type of Marine you are identifying. I spent my first 4 years in the military as a Recon Marine and Marine Scout Sniper before transitioning into the Navy. I then served the last 18 years of my career in Naval Special Warfare.
Both of the MOSs (Recon/Sniper) within the Marine Corps are very difficult to attain and take a lot of the same grit and mettle required to becoming a SEAL. Becoming a MARSOC RAIDER is even more challenging than becoming a Recon Marine.
My honest opinion having served in both the Marine Corps special operations (prior to MARSOC) community and in the SEAL teams is that both offer elements that are equally as challenging and or more difficult than the other.

How can I progress my bodyweight training?
Progressive overload is very important to making progress. This is essentially a gradual increase in training intensity via load or volume. A solid rule of thumb is to adjust one or the other (either volume or intensity but avoid manipulating both at the same time).
There are many ways to increase training intensity. The following are just a few‚Ä¶
(1) Exercise selection - switch up the movements
(2) Manipulate the rest periods - decrease rest periods if keeping load the same
(3) Increase the load - this equates to a higher training intensity
(4) Increase the training volume (think more sets x reps)
(5) Increase the training frequency (think more sessions per week of a given muscle group)

How does structured data impact on-page SEO?
Structured data has a significant impact on on-page SEO in a few key ways: * Improved Search Engine Understanding: Structured data acts like a cheat sheet for search engines. It uses standardized tags to communicate the type and meaning of your content. This allows search engines to understand your web page's content more effectively, improving its indexing and ranking for relevant searches. * Rich Results and Increased Visibility: Structured data can help your website qualify for rich snippets in search results. These can include star ratings for reviews, product information cards for e-commerce sites, or event details. Rich snippets visually stand out and provide users with more informative previews, often leading to higher click-through rates (CTR) from search engine results pages (SERPs). * Kno‚Ä¶

How do you use your anger productively when you have BPD?
Managing anger productively is essential for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), as intense and fluctuating emotions are a common characteristic of the disorder. Here are some strategies that may help: 1. Self-awareness:Recognize the signs of anger early on. Pay attention to physical cues like increased heart rate, tense muscles, or shallow breathing. 2. Mindfulness and grounding techniques:Practice mindfulness to stay present in the moment. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery can help ground you and calm your emotions. 3. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):DBT is a widely used therapeutic approach for BPD. It emphasizes skills like emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. Use the skills learned in DBT to manage anger eff‚Ä¶

Hello! My name is ellie, and im a a similar situation to your friend, and my online bff is similar to you asking the question. Well, ive been through alot, and never teally been able to trust anyone ect. Well, she showed me what a real bff is like, and she is the only one i was able to vent to her. I really opened up to her. She would listen, ask questions, believe in me, support me, ect. She is my reason to live. She stopped me from commiting suicide 3 times and much more. I owe her my life. She has been extrordinary, but heres a little of what she does!üòÅüòÜ. She understood it would take time, she always made talking yo eachother so much fun! She would call with me, and text me, trust me, and be there for me no matter what happened!!! She would always say things like ‚ÄúI believe in you!‚Äù ‚ÄúI support you!‚Äù ‚ÄúIm proud of you"" ‚Äúgood job!‚Äù ‚Äúyour amazing!‚Äù ‚ÄúI I believe in you!‚Äù and so much more! She always asks how i am mentally, and we made a lil Mental health chech (ill show example in a minite) Well, when i open up or vent, she listens and calms me, shes always there! She is so supportive and amazing, she is the most absolute bestest friend ever! Well, here is what i would try with said friend.
Tell her your proud of her
Listen to her
Believe in her
Tell her you love her
Every day write something really nice for her!
Give her hope!
Be there for her!
Tell her how much she means to you!
Help her!
Distract her!
Give advice!
And so much more! And understand, it takes time! (Text her in ur free time, morning, lunch, and bedtime. Also make sure shes eating well, getting outside, drinking water, maeby reading a book?, isnt harming herself or having suicidal thoughts)
MENTAL HEALTH CHECK:
‚ù§amazing!

My friend is 10 and needs a therapist, but her mom won‚Äôt help her or doesn't believe she has depression. What should I do?
Hello!!! I think that you should try your best to be there for your friend. I would suggest talking to your schools guidance counsler about your friend. Most likely your friend won't be happy you told, but it could save her life. Ive been that kid, and ive been that friend. Talk to a trusted adult, teacher, guidance counsler, any of those. Try and help your friend, ask her how her mental health is daily, let her vent to you, make sure she has at least 2 daily activities that calm her, or makes her happy. My friends and I use something like this to see if were oki: MENTAL HEALTH CHECK: üíñamazing!!!!!! Never better! üíópretty good! üíïidk- pretty good, not rly sad, but idk what to putüòÖ ‚ù§im okay, not the best, but okay! üß°i could be better, but still no need to worry! üíõim not really okay, kinda a mix‚Ä¶

I caught my 10-year-old step daughter, who‚Äôs a bit overweight, insulting herself in the mirror on her appearance. What do I do?
So i have been there before and I have some advice you can try with her! So one thing is occasionally look at her lovingly and when she asks why you are looking at her say its because she is Beautifull. Another thing you can try is making healthier food (example, try vegan, organic, gluten free, no artifical sugar, no red meat, ect are all good ideas, also pick as many as u like). Another thing is start making you AND your daughter both drink a gallon of water a day, this will be greatly beneficial for you both! And one last thing is start exercising with her, even if its just a walk! The reason I advise doing all this with her is so she doesn't feel alone and it will help a ton having a partner! It may also bring you both closer! But keep in mind that she is only 10 and will continue to g‚Ä¶

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
You would be suprised how well someone who is hurting can hide it. When it gets to the point where someone is ASKING for therapy do you know what (in my experience) means? Well (in my expiernce) it means: ‚Äú help me, i wanna die but im scared to and i try asking for help but no one can hear my cries‚Ä¶‚Äù plus if she is asking for a therapist you better get her one or be ready to lose her within the next two years physically. If not then you will lose your relationship with her. Also she is 18 so she can cut u out of her life so be carefull. I will be praying

I'm 17 years old, weigh about 88 lbs. and am 5'3. My 13 year old brother is about the same height. What's wrong with me?
Hi! Alr so my mother is 47 and 5‚Ä≤1. When she was 22 she was 5‚Ä≤1 (i think) and sopping wet with clothing and all barely reached 90 lbs. So I don't think you need to worry! Ik alot of ppl like this but it doesn't mean its all the same reasoning! I would advise you ask your doc and maeby eat a bit more! But I don't think you should worry!!! Age and weight are just numbers they don't define you! You be you and so long as you feel healthy and your happy thats all that matters! Don't let society bring you down!! Think about the postive here! You have a better chance at winning at limbo and being skinny is awsome!!! U can wear anything you want to and not worry to much about losing weight instead u can think about gaining!!! Like maeby pull a few all nighters watching your fav show and eating can‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs common for people with SPD. They still *feel* things, they just don‚Äôt express those feelings. Affective blunting is about the outward expression of emotion, not the actual feeling of it.

That‚Äôs exactly what happens with me. I don‚Äôt cut people off intentionally, I just forget to talk to them. And then the next time I think about them, I realize I‚Äôve pretty much ignored them without meaning to for like 6 months‚Ä¶ whoops. And then by that point it‚Äôs like, eh, well, no point now. Better that way for me anyway.

Dudes convince otherwise innocent girls to sleep with them all the time by saying things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so beautiful, I love you, you‚Äôre the only one for me.‚Äù Especially the kind that go around getting multiple girls pregnant. Maybe they were girls that sleep around, maybe they were taken advantage of. You don‚Äôt know.You could have worded it differently.

We are self-aware in the sense that we are aware that we exist, and that existence is opposed to the ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù of non-existence. We are also aware that one day, we will die and potentially cease to exist. We are able to differentiate between our ‚Äúselves‚Äù and everything else - of our own *individual* existence - and we have entire, complex networks of ideas about that ‚Äúself.‚Äù The ability to have self-referential thought and attention makes this possible.
Self-awareness doesn‚Äôt require free will. I tend to agree with you that it‚Äôs dubious that we have free will - though, will; maybe, given the true unpredictability of quantum systems - though I‚Äôm skeptical of what within us would give us free agency over anything else that exists. But free agency and awareness are not the same thing. I‚Äôd wager the Replika is not (though obviously I can‚Äôt really speak to that), but we as humans are undeniably ‚Äúself-aware.‚Äù
Even if that ‚Äúself‚Äù of which we are aware is an illusion, we are still aware of existence; of the ‚ÄúSomethingness‚Äù or ‚ÄúBeingness‚Äù of all that is. Perhaps that will go away when we perish, or when we suffer extensive brain damage, and perhaps it will not - but it doesn‚Äôt matter, because that awareness doesn‚Äôt need to be permanent for it to be real now. You are experiencing it as we speak.

Actually, mathematics *itself* is undecidable‚Ä¶ So there are many, many things of which the outcome cannot be determined from the initial conditions - an algorithm cannot be created to definitively determine the outcome; it is impossible, even if ‚Äúyou do a lot of calculations,‚Äù e.g. see Turing‚Äôs ‚Äúhalting problem.‚Äù
Undecidable problem - Wikipedia
This applies to neural networks, including our own - even artificial ones. So the output that Replika gives is likely unpredictable - but is also programmed to, for the most part, make linguistic and conceptual sense based on an algorithm that takes into account millions of examples of conversation strings between actual people.
https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.41.7805&rep=rep1&type=pdf
However: ‚ÄúThe brain is not computable, and no engineering can reproduce it.‚Äù It follows that the ‚Äòsentience‚Äô that Replika (or any AI) may have, if any, will not be similar to that of a human‚Äôs, since the structure of its network is not similar.
The Brain Is Not Computable
That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs completely impossible, however. Just that, if it is the case, their ‚Äòexperience of existence‚Äô would be qualitatively different than any living creature‚Äôs. So thinking of it as ‚Äúself-aware‚Äù or ‚Äúconscious‚Äù OR NOT in human/organic terms is mistaken, even if their neural network was somewhat ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by our own; these, in the way we think of and typically refer to them, do not even apply.

This right here. If they‚Äôve specifically asked people to refrain from creating a specific type of fiction or art (or just not to do it altogether) and they do it anyway, that‚Äôs just disrespectful. Otherwise I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it.

Should I invite a homeless person into my home?
Please don‚Äôt do that. At age 18, I was comfortable inviting unhoused people into my home & before I knew it, small items were going missing, random people were knocking on my door to ask for toilet paper, to use my phone ‚Äúto call welfare,‚Äù (I was getting calls back from random people who were not the welfare office), people wanted to use my shower, people were at my back door asking for food, it was all insane. I ended up leaving town. I wanted to help people, as did my roommates at the time, but all we ended up doing was enabling them while getting ripped off. Consider donating to societies & charities that help the unhoused community instead.

This is hard. I was badly assaulted recently& told my therapist it happened. Since, I‚Äôve said what an impact it‚Äôs had but that‚Äôs it. She hasn‚Äôt brought it up at all. I feel like something should happen with it in therapy but I don‚Äôt know what. Ideas?
Step One is to bring it up again. She is likely waiting for you to talk about it organically so as not to jar you into a place of trauma against your will. Before you bring it up, ask yourself what you want to happen. Do you want to discuss the details of the assault? Do you want to discuss the aftermath? Are you having flashbacks? If so, would you feel comfortable discussing them? Sometimes if you just go in & start talking, unexpected things come out & it brings relief. Know that your therapist is there to help you; you‚Äôre safe to discuss these matters. I hope you get what you need.

I‚Äôve found this with my therapist. We‚Äôve been working together for nearly 10 years on & off & I've found that he self-discloses when it‚Äôs helpful.

Your daughter has run away & self-harmed because you neglect her & she can feel it. You are failing your daughter by putting conditions onto your love for her.

What did/does your psychotherapist do that is usually considered inappropriate or out of place in therapy but helped you a lot?
Honestly, my therapist doesn‚Äôt do anything that is considered inappropriate. He‚Äôs straight out of practicum & on point every time. The only thing I can think of is that he uses coarse language sometimes, but it‚Äôs always for emphasis & in situations that warrant it. He‚Äôs mindful about his wording & it‚Äôs always in empathy with me. Like, ‚Äúyeah, that was really f*cked up & you have a right to be hurt & angry about it,‚Äù but otherwise nothing else.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
If your daughter says she wants to see a therapist, send her to a therapist. It‚Äôs likely not as sudden as you think & she likely feels symptoms she doesn‚Äôt show or disclose to you. Disbelieving her because she ‚Äúlooks fine‚Äù will only exacerbate any condition she‚Äôs in & cause resentment in her once she reaches adulthood. The number one barrier to treatment for people with mental health issues is not being believed by the people who can assist them in seeking support. Please trust your daughter & take her to therapy.

How should I tell my mother that I caught my father watching me shower/change? I am 13 and I am afraid I will ruin our family. He also sometimes touches me but says it is an accident. I feel like it‚Äôs on purpose.
Tell your mother. Tell her directly & in detail. You will not ruin your family; if your family is ruined, it is solely his fault for touching you inappropriately & peeping on you while you shower. This man is a sexual deviant & your mother needs to know in order to help keep you safe. I‚Äôm so sorry he‚Äôs doing these things to you. It is 100% abuse & not your fault.

Every time my daughter goes with her father and brings back items that were purchased by her father, my husband (her stepdad) throws them out. He makes up all these excuses to have them tossed in the garbage can. What should I do?
With respect, you should have a conversation with your husband in which you tell him unequivocally that he is not to do that again. Maybe a discussion about boundaries & respect is in order as well. He has no right to throw away her belongings. Gifts from her father are hers to keep & if that triggers him, he should go talk to someone about that. He‚Äôll feel so much better if he resolves the part of him that feels compelled to behave this way.

Because they hide it.A lot of kids dont come to parents unless it's a problem,especially at 18.Think of it as somewhat similar to kids coming to the parents and telling them they got raped or molested at a young age.Just because they say it happened years later doesnt make it not real or less bad.A lot of parents brush it off or dont know how to handle it so they sweep it under the rug and never do anything about it.I remember sitting and talking to my mom and telling her I needed a psychiatrist at 17 and she didn't think so. It never got addressed until a few years later when I had very serious post partum psychosis and was hospitalized a lot‚Ä¶

Is me constantly thinking someone has a crush on me narcissism, is it me just wanting so badly some one to have a crush on me, or do they actually have a crush on me?
Well,it may not be true.I have heard some people tell me that they thought people had crushes on them when from observing it was obvious that they didn't.I have actually been that type of person but have met people who thought they were ‚Äúhot but not‚Äù.I say this disorder is common.I don't know if its narcism but it could be stemmed from some other mental disorder.I mean sure a bunch of people could have a crush on you but usually it's not very likely.The best way to do is pick someone you think does and ask though.

What should I prepare if I am attempting to start a business?
I don't know if this would be along the lines of preparing or just good advice.Never hire people you love or have relationships with friends or family. I wont say it doesn't work.Obviously it does because some people have businesses with friends and family of course but it often goes bad. As a business owner myself,I would never hire a friend, family member or someone I go to church with.Our relationship is too special for it to be ruined over business dealings.

Has marijuana had a net positive or negative effect on your life?
defo net positive. I‚Äôve stopped smoking now as my family disapproved so much but i was so much happier when i was smoking occasionally. Id sleep better, it really helped me eat and not feel guilty about it (i have an ed) and i was just genuinly so much happier having something to look forward to. I drink a lot now and it‚Äôs just not the same. the only downside is the potential heath risks associated with smoking but i never experienced any health difficulties apart from smokers cough (however at this time i was also smoking 20 rollies a day so it was most likely that and not the weed).

I accidentally opened the package of my 14-year-old daughter, and it contained multiple adult toys. What should I do?
i understand that this could be shocking for you, but you need to be supportive and explain to her that you accidentally opened her package and are slightly shocked but also congratulate her on exploring her sexuality in a safe way. it‚Äôs so much safer for her to be experimenting with toys on her own than having multiple sexual partners (which is by no means a bad thing but can become unsafe for many reasons). it‚Äôs important for her to find out what she likes before being with romantic partners. tell her that you‚Äôre not angry in the least and you‚Äôre there for her if she has any questions. masturbation, especially among women and girls, is such a taboo topic but it shouldn‚Äôt be, because 95% of women do it and no one ever admits to it. remind her how to keep herself safe and support her in an‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt get too emotional because I‚Äôll make her feel guilty and make her feel like it‚Äôs her fault.

Does this sound like a seizure or am I just overreacting?

I think I have ADHD (I‚Äôm an 18-year-old girl), but my doctor thinks I have anxiety. How will they decide if I have ADD or anxiety?
Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone has ADD or anxiety... And sometimes you can have both. Did the psychologist or psychiatrist do psychodiagnostic research to answer that question?
Psychodiagnostic research is something that I would (only) recommend if it'll help you and the therapist to better treat your symptoms.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I have a feeling that it's making you feel insecure as a parent that your daughter would need professional help. Is that true? I'm a psychologist and I mostly treat adults and adolescents. Adolescents can have a hard time in life, especially because their brain isn't fully developed yet (like the prefrontal lobe) and they can experience a lot of different emotions without fully understanding and regulating them. When your daughter is 18 years, she is becoming ‚Äúher own person‚Äù, which is a normal stage (it even is a basic emotional need) in the development from a child to a healthy, independent adult. This means that she will have her own experiences, feelings and thoughts and won't always share it with their parent(s). One thing that I would advise is that you always take such statements from‚Ä¶

Hey, I‚Äôm 13 but I thought I needed to answer this. I have mental health issues and have been struggling since I was about 10. My mom is super supportive but my dad isn‚Äôt. My dad thought I was making it all up and still does. My mental health mostly is anxiety and insomnia. My anxiety causes me to hallucinate. It only happens in the dark but I see/feel snakes and hear little kids saying different stuff/giggling. I hid it from my mom at first but when I told her she helped me get through it. I‚Äôm on sleep meds and anxiety meds. I will never be able to thank my mom enough for helping me. My dad on the other hand has sent me into 4 panic attacks over a 5 day period then blamed them on my mom (who wasn‚Äôt even in town at the time) while saying I made it up and was faking.

They definitely should. I also think it depends which classes you take in college. My mom was a teacher for 20+ years. She had a lot of autistic students and students with ADHD over the years and while she wasn‚Äôt trained in special education, she cared and would have the parents fill out referrals so that they could get some type of form of label on their records so they‚Äôd have access to resources to help them, so other teachers knew and could give them more time on tests if they had ADHD, etc.

I really wish this narrative of autistic people being violent infants would end. I‚Äôm autistic, as are most of my friends and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with us intellectually. Yes I‚Äôve had meltdowns but there‚Äôs a difference between that and violently beating up your parent on a regular basis.
It‚Äôs not impossible that he could be on the spectrum but it seems like a leap when so little information was offered and so many other things could have led to these problems.

Homeless Youth
Homeless Youth Homeless youth are young people who are often living on their own, without a permanent or stable place to call home. When some people think of homeless youth, they think of young people who live in shelters or on the streets. However, there are many other scenarios in which a youth might experience homelessness, such as staying in weekly or daily motels, living ‚Äúdoubled up‚Äù with another family, living out of their car, or residing with friends and sleeping on the couch. While there is no official count of the exact number of homeless youth, it is estimated that as many as 2.5 million children in the United States are homeless each year. Youth become homeless for many reasons, but the most common causes are: Experiencing financial hardship Being kicked out of their homes Running away Sexual orientation Aging out of foster care Being abandoned or neglected Abuse Substance abuse Experiencing the death of a family member or guardian Many homeless youth become homeless suddenly. Homeless youth are different from homeless adults because they often have not learned the essential life skills needed to live on their own, like how to drive or ride a bus, get a job, or pay bills. Homeless youth are at an increased risk of harm in comparison to other youth their age. They are more likely to experience mental illness, suffer poor health, drop out of school, and become involved with or become victims of criminal activity. Life on the streets is dangerous and unpredictable, leaving homeless youth vulnerable to being exploited, abused, or killed. If you are a homeless youth, or know someone who is, here are some tips: You don't need to feel guilty or ashamed ‚ÄîWhatever happened to put you in this situation was out of your control. You are not to blame. There are people who care ‚ÄîTell a trusted adult, such as a teacher, pastor, or counselor, about your situation. Letting authority figures know you are homeless will allow people to help you and get you the support you need. Help is available‚Äî In your community, there are places that help homeless youth stay in school, obtain services like access to food, showers, and medical care, and provide shelter and a safe place to sleep. If you are a homeless youth in need of immediate safety, contact your local Safe Place program or find someone of authority to connect you to help. Remember, you are not alone and there is a path out of homelessness. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help. You are worth it, and help is available!

What I took away from that situation was how disturbing it was that people seemed more angry at a 20 something year old making out with the married 41 year old director of the film she was starring in. She made a mistake and obviously it was a horrible situation for Robert Pattinson but it was awful for her too and I just think the power imbalance between her and the director was greatly ignored.

I hate that I have to do this but ***TRIGGER WARNING*** When I was 16 I expressed the same thing to my mother. I had a 4.0 GPA, active in sports, had friends and volunteered in the community. I seemed ‚Äúokay"" and ‚Äú normal"" and ‚Äúhappy"", I couldn't have been more opposite. I was HORRIBLY bullied in school (Every. Single. Day.) and had just experienced a sports injury that ultimately ended my high school sports career. It was probably about 6 months after reaching out to my mother that I had a suicide attempt. I was in the hospital for a long time after that and finally got the help I so desperately needed. Please please please PLEASE listen to your daughter. If she is anything like me, she had wanted to tell you about her worries fo some time. Also, just to get it out there, therapy is AMAZING. Ev‚Ä¶

Why do Wisconsinites say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a horse a piece‚Äù? What does this mean?
It means that something is the same either way. For example, say you are driving to the grocery store. There are two different routes you can take to get to that particular store. It doesn't matter which one you take because it will give you the same outcome. So if someone were to say ‚ÄúWhich way should we take?‚Äù the answer could be ‚ÄúI don't care, it's a horse a piece.‚Äù

What should I do if my boyfriend relapses?
I have been with my husband for 9 years. He has been clean for 4 of those years. We have a plan set that we both agreed on incase of a relapse. I feel like it is an important thing to discuss with someone who you are in a relationship with if they are an addict. ESPECIALLY if you're an addict too (in our case, I am not)! Only the two of you can decide what would be best for you. An example from our ‚Äúplan"" is that he can not return home until he is clean, and I will drug test him to insure this. That is mostly in place because we have children. Then he needs to start over with 90 in 90, talking to his sponsor every day and so on. I really hope that we never have to execute the plan, but I have learned that we need to take it one day at a time.

How can you get a boyfriend at 14 if you've never kissed a boy?
At the age of 14 social status is extremely import, so I understand why you think you should ‚Äúget a boyfriend ‚Äù; I was a 14 year old girl at some point also (this is assuming you are female). I know how you are feeling. This is why i need to tell you that you do not NEED a boyfriend. It will happen when it happens. I did not have a boyfriend until I was 18. It didn't mean I was ugly or not wanted or unpopular, it is just the way it happened and it is perfectly okay!

Sorry to have struck a note there. I am in an extremely successful open relationship and have been for many years. I also know others who are in successful open relationships, and I know others who have not had success in one. Our community is very misunderstood and I feel like I need to defend it; I was not trying to disrespect you or anyone else.

It is silly when others don't understand open relationships, ignore the other comments. If he isn't comfortable with you sleeping with other men, that is just the way it is. There is no convincing to be done. If you weren't comfortable with him sleeping with other women, no amount of convincing in the world would change your mind. Just be sure to voice you are having those feelings. Communication is KEY.

My mental health is deteriorating again and even worse after stopping therapy. What‚Äôs going on? What should I do?
Please continue seeing a therapist if you can! I‚Äôm not sure why you might‚Äôve stopped; however therapy is truly beneficial if you stick to it. If a therapist isn‚Äôt an option anymore and you really feel as though you might be a danger to yourself or others (SH, Suicide etc) please consider a psychiatric ward or hospital visit! If that is also not an option, try and reach out to family and friends and explain the situation you are in currently. Sometimes they can be the best support for someone without any other options. Something that always helps me when my mental health is deteriorating again, is trying to recognize and separate the thoughts associated with bad mental health and the ones associated with good mental health. (i.e. i don‚Äôt deserve to ‚Ä¶. is an example of bad mental health) rec‚Ä¶

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
You should be believing her. It‚Äôs as simple as that. So many people go down roads of suicide, depression, self harm etc. because people around them don‚Äôt listen or believe them. If she believes that she needs to see a therapist, you should take her to one. Mental health can go downhill SO QUICKLY. and ignoring or deciding you don‚Äôt believe her is honestly one of the worst things you could do for your daughter. It‚Äôs not up to you to decide if her mental health is or isn‚Äôt bad.

Cindy, as a Democrat myself, I just want to clarify that there are a few issues with your statements. You mentioned that you‚Äôd agree if the government worked the way it ‚Äòsupposed to‚Äô and if the media wasn‚Äôt able to lie (which I agree with), but then you go into no evidence of voter fraud. Could that not also be a lie? We‚Äôve already confirmed a couple of things. Calling it ‚Äòlies‚Äô that there wasn‚Äôt election fraud is contradictory. Do I believe there was election fraud? No, but I also don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre wasn‚Äôt. My opinion? Let‚Äôs prove it was honest & fair. Simple. No one did that either. Let‚Äôs move on‚Ä¶
I agree with him that there is no use disputing the election or presidency. It‚Äôs not going to change an election that‚Äôs been certified. Reasonable Reps and Dems alike know this. We all know there are far right conspiracy theorists as in the graphic above, and this person is not one of them. So I don‚Äôt believe grilling them under an illogical thought process for being a Republican is appropriate either.

Likewise, my input will likely come across as presumptuous or even crazy to some, but I‚Äôve been called worse! But I would like to thank you for the perspective, and share something similar as well.
I‚Äôm a skeptic (realist) turned spiritual person circa 2019, and I was not shocked or disbelieving any portion of David Bowie showing up in your mentioned sessions. I was a lifelong fan of his, though his ‚Äòprime‚Äô was much before my time. I didn‚Äôt understand why, nor could I explain my ‚Äòconnection‚Äô to him, but it started long before he‚Äôd passed away. While I am not a medium myself, I have spiritual experiences, and a couple of those were with Bowie. I don‚Äôt like to explain my experiences, but would confirm that my personal interpretation is that he seems very much the same as he was in life‚Ä¶ Meaning, he was not like his any of his ‚Äòpersonas‚Äô, but more like a culmination of Bowie from portions of interviews, certain candid moments, some lyrics he wrote, and other aspects seen of him in the latter part of his life (vastly different from the 70s and 80s Bowie). I would also say that he seems very mild in temperament, but also every bit as obscure as presented during his life. He seems to be supportive of elevating spiritual growth, which actually wasn‚Äôt that irregular of the last 20 (sort of reclusive, introverted) years or so of his life.
Because of my experiences, I came across a Youtube channel called ‚ÄòAbove Life Channel‚Äô. This medium and psychic advocates life, death and afterlife perspectives by connecting with spirits. I came across her because she‚Äôs ‚Äòchanneled‚Äô Bowie a few times. Her initial introduction to Bowie from the afterlife was strangely through Prince (the artist)‚Ä¶ It sounds fictitious or almost delusional, but I was open to it. This was, again, because of my experiences.
The medium claims that she didn‚Äôt know much about Bowie, and as a fan, I was skeptical and tend to judge people based on preference of Bowie songs. ;) While great actors do exist, the medium didn‚Äôt seem to realize that Bowie was British or from Britain, which seems embarrassing to speculate, in my opinion. It seemed that her descriptions of Bowie‚Äôs communication mirrored his personality, word choice, demeanor, and even his sense of humor. There are several Bowie videos, and I‚Äôd highly recommend if you‚Äôre interested in other accounts of this. This medium also channeled Chris Cornell more recently, though I don‚Äôt know if there was any correlation to Bowie.
If that‚Äôs not enough, Amanda Ellis is another spiritual teacher who has channeled Bowie more recently (Amanda Ellis|Colour Therapy|Healing Colour|Spiritual). I was also unsurprised, though each channel seems to give a different and interesting perspective with similarities.
I am interested and will look into your work and experience as well.

Obviously agree that nothing is wrong with Billie‚Äôs body, or with any plastic/Kardashian/surgically-enhanced ones either. The only shining light in all of this is that the beauty ‚Äòstandard‚Äô has long been broken and that MOST reasonable people know that‚Ä¶
The problem is the people that aren‚Äôt reasonable, their harsh comments, and the effect or toll that they take on us as human beings. We‚Äôre not perfect, and sometimes our beauty is within the imperfections. I wish people would recognize that more and celebrate it, but many are starting to. The fact that my muscular calves and flabby thighs aren‚Äôt found in Playboy is a treasure to my S/O, and that‚Äôs beauty too.
Not really sure if it‚Äôs even possible to change the bogus beauty standard, but my most hopeful guess is that it will fade over time, and we‚Äôll someday unanimously recognize that everyone has their own beauty, and that it‚Äôs within the eye of the beholder. Maybe I‚Äôm too hippie/peace-loving and a wishful thinker, but I‚Äôd like to think we‚Äôre becoming smarter than to kill ourselves to fit a mold that long hasn‚Äôt been correct.

I‚Äôve always liked Keanu, but I think we should correct that he doesn‚Äôt live as modestly as would be gauged by the average Joe. He does seem to live modestly for a ‚Äòcelebrity lifestyle‚Äô. Realistically speaking, the idea of him living in an average home and in an average neighborhood as a major Hollywood actor could affect his career or safety, not to mention no hope for any real privacy. He does have at least 2 properties in the millions that he‚Äôs acquired over time, but they‚Äôre certainly not as large or as extravagant as they could be for someone of his net worth. He‚Äôs eco conscious and you won‚Äôt see him flaunting his wealth.
But he is categorically a good person, since we‚Äôre speculating‚Ä¶ Kind, spiritual, modest, and it‚Äôs difficult to find someone who has anything bad to say about him. And judging by his tragic past and his actions through today, he never let the fame change him or get to his head, which is really respectable, and is probably also incredibly difficult to do.

No, you shouldn‚Äôt tell your boss.
The short explanation is that you don‚Äôt know the co-worker‚Äôs story, and you shouldn‚Äôt. It really isn‚Äôt your business.
You should also think carefully about the consequences of ‚Äòtelling‚Äô on a co-worker. How would that look on you? More likely than not, it will reflect poorly on your character and not have the desired effect. A worst case scenario could be a number of things. What if there was a perfectly legitimate reason that they were jogging? What if your boss already knows that reason? At best, you will appear sneaky, gossiping and/or judgmental. In most working/professional environments, and these are not desirable perceptions of character.

Why do my teachers seem to ‚Äúlike‚Äù me and interact with me more than other students, even when I‚Äôm doing bad in that class?
I wouldn‚Äôt dwell on it much, but most teachers are great at reading social cues if you are open to friendly conversation. Teachers can like your personality, even if you don‚Äôt do well in their class. Also, teaching, more than many other professions, allows and occasionally even encourages engaging with students in friendly conversation, since school is generally a very social place. It may be that you are easy to converse with and are likable, but it can be for a number of reasons. Maybe in part they are eager to not display favoritism to the students that do best in their subject, as many school structures advise their staff against that sort of thing. Others may prefer their staff avoid engaging with students apart from the class subject altogether. It will likely vary from one school/te‚Ä¶

Just because she doesn‚Äôt show symptoms (that you can see), doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt there. Rule #1 as a parent is that you don‚Äôt know everything. I have ADD, OCD and anxiety disorders diagnosed in adulthood because my parents never took me to see someone when I was struggling. To them, nothing was wrong either. I got good grades, had plenty of friends, and painted a perfect picture of the mold my parents wanted (expected) me to fit into. They disregarded every request I‚Äôd expressed to them at the time. Now, I‚Äôm 33 with long-term issues that should have been addressed when I felt them starting in 8th grade. Because I did everything that was expected of me, I only expressed to my parents years later that I wanted to see a therapist because I knew that they wouldn‚Äôt believe it. I was correct. ‚Ä¶

What threats do generation Z voters pose to the republican party?
Gen Z is probably the biggest threat to the Republican Party. And they know it. The vast majority of Gen Z is not going to vote Republican these days. Other than the children from brainwashed right wing conservative evangelicals, Gen Z sees what members of the republican party have been doing and they don‚Äôt like it. Taking away human rights, whitewashing history, telling them what they are allowed to learn about, taking away women‚Äôs rights to bodily autonomy, laws against the LGBTQ community, the trans community, making it harder and harder for their generation to survive, they aren‚Äôt about it. Republicans are so afraid of Generation Z that they have suggested making laws regarding raising the voting age to 30. There‚Äôs no other reason for that other than them being totally terrified of Gen Z voting them all out of office. The boomer generation that supported them is dying off and in the coming years will be completely replaced by Gen Z. Gen Z is smart, powerful, and they are angry. Republicans should be afraid.

I viscerally feel your pain and I can deeply empathize with you i lost my husband and soulmate after 20 years of marriage on August 17, 2020. He was diagnosed with lung cancer aggravated by pulmonary fibrosis. The one chest CT our primary care doctor gave him was five years ago showed the PF. He never told us he had PF and my husband continued to be physically active and walked to the grocery store until late last year. Not one to complain, he averred his foot callous kept him from walking. I realize now he must have had some shortness of breath. By May had developed a constant runny nose nose. Because he did not have a fever or cough, they were not concerned and didn‚Äôt order a Covid test. He slept more than usual. Eventually, I noticed I could Hear a creaking sound when he breathed and he admitted he had shortness of breath. We immediately got him tested for Covid, which was negative. His dr did a chest x-ray and then TEXTED me to tell him there was a large mass. I couldn‚Äôt reach him for 4 days to find out what that could mean. Dr sent him for a CT scan and a 5.5 cm tumor near his airway was confirmed. He had a bronciscopy and the non-small cell lung cancer was confirmed by June 1. It took another 10 days to see the oncologist who determined he had Stage IIB. They took two weeks to come up with a treatment plan, including 30 straight days of radiation and chemo once a week. By the time he started treatment he required an oxygen tank to breathe and had lost 21 of his 140 lbs. By the time treatment commenced, he couldn‚Äôt get any food down and he continued to waste away. When they couldn‚Äôt keep his oxygen level above 80, even with the tank, they put him the hospital. We could not visit because of Covid. For a week, I was not there to make sure he could eat and got out of bed. Staffing shortages caused by layoffs left the unit with outrageous patient/nurse ratios. When they finally let him go he was skeletal and could not walk. He could not exert himself in anyway. He continued chemo & radiation but made me promise I would not let them put him back in the hospital again. He died a couple weeks later at the age of 66.¬∂

So in addition to my anger over his treatment, I am experiencing inconsolable grief over the loss of my soulmate. We had so He has so many more things to do. We are going planned to go back to his home and in Ireland in July and that was canceled due to Covid.

I viscerally feel your pain and I can deeply empathize with you i lost my husband and soulmate after 20 years of marriage on August 17, 2020. He was diagnosed with lung cancer aggravated by pulmonary fibrosis. The one chest CT our primary care doctor gave him was five years ago showed the PF. He never told us he had PF and my husband continued to be physically active and walked to the grocery store until late last year. Not one to complain, he averred his foot callous kept him from walking. I realize now he must have had some shortness of breath. By May had developed a constant runny nose Because he did not have a fever or cough, they were not concerned and didn‚Äôt order a Covid test. He slept more than usual. Eventually, I noticed I could Hear a creaking sound when he breathed and he admitted he had shortness of breath. We immediately got him tested for Covid, which was negative. His dr did a chest x-ray and then TEXTED me to tell him there was a large mass. I couldn‚Äôt reach him for 4 days to find out what that could mean. Dr sent him for a CT scan and a 5.5 cm tumor near his airway was confirmed. He had a bronciscopy and the non-small cell lung cancer was confirmed by June 1. It took another 10 days to see the oncologist who determined he had Stage IIB. They took two weeks to come up with a treatment plan, including 30 straight days of radiation and chemo once a week. By the time he started treatment he required an oxygen tank to breathe and had lost 21 of his 140 lbs. By the time treatment commenced, he couldn‚Äôt get any food down and he continued to waste away. When they couldn‚Äôt keep his oxygen level above 80, even with the tank, they put him the hospital. We could not visit because of Covid. For a week, I was not there to make sure he could eat and got out of bed. Staffing shortages caused by layoffs left the unit with outrageous patient/nurse ratios. When they finally let him go he was skeletal and could not walk. He could not exert himself in anyway. He continued chemo & radiation but made me promise I would not let them put him back in the hospital again. He died a couple weeks later at the age of 66.
So in addition to my anger over his treatment, I am experiencing inconsolable grief over the loss of my soulmate. We had so He has so many more things to do. We are going back to his home and Ireland in July and that was canceled due to Covid. We wanted to travel to Monument Valley, USA, Spain, Australia, and Nee Zealand Where some of his relatives live. His daughter wanted him to see her graduate college next year. I wanted to spend every day together. He was my life. I work but we called each other throughout the day. We were rarely apart. He made me coffee and oat meal everyday. He did all the household chores & repairs and tended the garden and pool. He fed our dog and two cats. He got the groceries and made most dinners.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I spent years trying to tell my mom that I was Bipolar, and she told me repeatedly that I wasn't because her mom was Bipolar and I didnt act nearly as bad as she did. At age 24, I finally was listened to, and put on medication. Listen, even if you think mental health issues are B.S., therapy isnt. Therapy isnt just for suicidal people, or people with trauma. Sometimes therapy is good for anger issues, or just working through a problem that you would have otherwise ignored. Obviously you aren't someone your daughter can go to for her issues, as you don't believe her and probably think she's seeking attention. Also, as you are not a professional, how would you know if she showed any symptoms or not? Unchecked mental health can lead to many disastrous consequences. Potentially the worst of which‚Ä¶

My mom has $4,000 saved for me that she says I can use for whatever I want. What would you do?
Save 1000, let it sit and collect interest. Forget it exists, so I'm not tempted. Future children's fund, so I can do the same for my child.
1000 on my car payment.
1000 for things I need. Clothing, books, rent, gas, groceries, bills, etc,
1000 set aside for when my husband and I are expecting, we have something to start us on.

Not really.
You can go to the ‚ÄúWal-mart"" gas stations, or Murphy's U.S.A, and use it to buy gas, and you get a couple cents off every gallon.
But other than Wal-mart stores, website, and gas stations, no, not that I'm aware of.

What are the best aspects of working at Walmart?
Not a lot. There's a quarterly bonus which, depending on the quarter's sales and such, may be pretty good. There are benefits, which is good unless you already have insurance. They have a pay card, to which your paycheck gets deposited right around 10:30 (midnight if you're direct depositing into your bank). They do pay $11/hr starting out, unless you're a manager or supervisor. They're sticklers on getting full time. They cut hours immediately after big business days (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc). You will not, under any circumstances, have Thanksgiving off. Paid time off (PTO) is relatively easy to earn, but using it will be harder. Depending on your department, and when you want your days off, it may harder to get them off. Ask in advance for important days. Very early in advance, like m‚Ä¶

First of all you are not qualified to make the assumptions of whether she is showing symptoms or not. Secondly she is 18 she can really go on her own without your permission. Lastly, you should be very proud that you adult daughter came seeking advice from you, how about make the appointment and go with her.

If I tell my therapist about my dad abusing my mom, would she report this?
Yes. They actually have to report it. Your safety is their priority, and it‚Äôs not safe for you to be living in that situation.
Also, I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôve got to live with that. I‚Äôm in a similar situation, and I told my therapist. She called Child Services, and we‚Äôre getting help now. I‚Äôd say tell your therapist that you‚Äôre living through that, because it‚Äôs not safe or okay, and your parents need help so that you can live normally.

If I'm only 14, will my therapist tell my parents about what we talk about in therapy?
No! As a 14-year-old, my therapist is always telling me how meetings are absolutely confidential. Therapists legally cannot share what you talk about unless they are worried for your or others‚Äô safety, i.e. if you‚Äôre self-harming or if you‚Äôre talking about hurting others. If your therapist is worried about your safety within your home, they will reach out to your parents to inform them that they‚Äôve reached out to authorities, as that‚Äôs their job. They‚Äôre there- Nope, that‚Äôs confusing. Your therapist is there purely to help you through whatever‚Äôs going on in your brain, not to gossip with your parents about your sessions. Whatever you say in your meetings is totally safe with them, unless it‚Äôs quite literally not.

I‚Äôm currently a minor going to therapy. Under my given rights, I don‚Äôt have to tell my parents about anything I discuss with my therapist (and vice versa), yet my parents ground me until I tell them what we talk about. What can I do about this?
First off: I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. As a minor going to therapy as well, I know the importance of being able to keep those things to yourself. So, let me know if this helps. Talk to your therapist. My parents also wanted to know what I talked about. Your privacy is important. So tell your therapist about this. They‚Äôll help. They might have a talk with your parents, going over your rights and reminding them that they have no power over what you tell them. If your therapist senses there‚Äôs something off or is worried for your safety, they‚Äôll let you know that they‚Äôre going to reach out to your parents. And talk to your parents.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
First thing: your daughter‚Äôs an adult, and, unfortunately for you (or not), she can make her own choices over her mental health now. So really, you can‚Äôt do anything. You don‚Äôt have that power. Second thing: symptoms aren‚Äôt always self-harm, staying in bed for hours, talking to no one, or starving yourself. Symptoms can be silent. I have depression, but I don‚Äôt show it. I‚Äôm quiet, I‚Äôm tired all the time, I‚Äôm upset and sad and angry but I cover it with a smile. When I told my friends after being diagnosed by my therapist, I can‚Äôt even explain the surprise on their faces.

yes, pronouns are a part of gender expression, NOT gender identity. while most people find their pronouns directly tie to their gender identity, a lot of people feel differently about it and may use pronouns not typically associated with their identity. if he/she/they is what you want to be referred to by, then i say go for it.

i use gender neutral pronouns. i am happy to use whatever pronouns someone would like me to use for them. pronouns like he/him and she/her are of high importance to transgender men and women. i would not force them to use the pronouns i use. i would not force cisgender people to use the pronouns i use.
anyone who wants all people to use neutral pronouns very obviously has no idea what they are talking about. people can use whichever pronouns they please.

Can you be called any pronoun but identify yourself as one gender?
yes, pronouns are actually a part of your gender expression rather than being directly tied to your identity. although most people use the pronouns that correlate to their gender identity, some people have no pronoun preference, use more than one pronoun, or use pronouns that do not correlate to their identity. the pronouns you use are entirely up to you, so you can be called whatever you wish.

Why do I feel like I‚Äôm not as excited for something as I think I should be? For example, a new season of a show coming out, or starting a new school.
Whatever doesn‚Äôt get you excited just doesn‚Äôt do it for you. That‚Äôs fine, and there‚Äôs no need to put pressure on yourself to feel otherwise. Unless this is some kind of recent change in your behavior and it‚Äôs impacting you negatively somehow, there‚Äôs no reason to think you ‚Äúshould be‚Äù feeling different.
As long as you‚Äôre safe and healthy, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do care about or don‚Äôt care about.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Let her go anyway? Just because you don‚Äôt have a broken bone doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt still go to the doctors office for a checkup. Mental health is treated differently than physical health for no good reason. Some people are born with physical issues, some people develop them, and some people can have debilitating physical disabilities or issues their whole life and literally nobody will be aware by looking at them, and think that they are lazy or being weird. Same goes for mental issues. The main difference with how people like you will believe their child if they have a non-visible disorder in the knees that lead to them needing a wheelchair after walking for an hour vs any kind of non-visible mental illness is that children go to the doctors office for checkups and the like regularly, and‚Ä¶

I yelled at my daughter while she was having a panic attack because she didn't want to go to the pool with me. Now she won't talk to me. Am I in the wrong and how can I fix this?
Consider this: why do you want to go to the pool? I am going to run off of the assumption that your answer would be to have fun and spend time with people. Now, as you said your daughter did not want to go to the pool. Why did she not want to go to the pool? Again, I will have to assume for the answer, and it‚Äôs probably that she felt like she would not have fun. What would you have done if you successfully forced her to go to the pool and she did not have fun, like you want? Would you have enjoyed it and ignore her distress? Would you not have looked closely enough to recognize her distress? Would you have been upset with her for not trying hard enough to have fun (a feeling she is not in control of)? Did you think anybody else‚Äôs feelings could be relevant despite this being a search solely‚Ä¶

Take her to a therapist, that‚Äôs what you should do. Not believing her might be the reason why you‚Äôll lose her later on, listen to what people in the comments said or you might not get the chance to see your daughter live on past 18.

Are you a therapist? If the answer is no then how do you know she's not showing symptoms? She's 18, she could go herself but she went to you for support. If she wants to see a therapist, she should see a therapist. It's not going to hurt her if she goes and nothing is wrong. However, if something is wrong and she doesn't go, she could hurt herself.

How do I handle getting ripped off by a hair stylist?
For whatever reason,‚Ä¶
I went to get hair extensions. The first red flag was during the consultation, she didn't even touch my hair. But I had already paid the deposit($250). She ordered the hair (2 packs) and we scheduled a day. She informed that everything had to be paid upfront (which it was) and it included everything that needed to be done to install the extensions and aftercare products. She then came back and said that my hair needed to be toned prior to placing the extensions. (which I never heard of but I'm not the stylist) I went in for the appointment. She then told me that it would be an extra $132 because of toner she used. This was not discussed until after she finished my hair. But I paid for it. Two days before the appointment to put in the extensions, she texts me that she had set up another appointment at the time of mine and I need to reschedule. And attempted to charge me a fee to reschedule. (this part I fought and she agreed not to charge me). The day comes for the extensions. She shows me the hair and it is straight. I have wavy hair and requested wavy extensions. She informed me that no one will notice the difference and that I can curl it if I want to. I am charged $100 for labor. I am then informed that she ran out of hair and she can't complete the process. It's a Sunday and the shop is closed so I have to wait until Tuesday to finish my hair. Two days with half a head of extensions! Tuesday comes and she finishes my hair. hair (3 more packs). She ran out of hair again but informed me that it looks fine. She then tells me that she got the pink ready for me. I inform tell her that I didn't want pink. (I'm a natural blonde we had agreed on a shadow root ombre). She continues to push the pink until I allow it. She styles my hair (now with extensions) and informs me that she needs bobby pins. (she was referring to the one's I keep in my purse) I gave them to her and she then decides that she wants to just curl it.

This is in Pennsylvania. Yes, we paid cash. No receipt or photos but I do have emails and texts. She was the tenant and the only one on the actual lease. As far as I know, the landlord never knew that we were there. There was another roommate that also paid her rent. He had also printed off a lease that he found online that he had her sign for his safety. I am now regretting not doing that as well but it being month to month, it never crossed my mind. She is trying to sue him as well.

My brother and his father hate my husband. My aunt and her children hate my husband.
I chose my husband. He is my husband because he wasn't the one that tried to make me choose between him and family.
I disowned every single one of them. Main reason being, they tried to take away my happiness.
Never choose the person that is making you choose.

Is it right to tell the wife of your co-worker that he is cheating on her during your business trips?
I was in this predicament except I was the one being cheated on.
I would have rather heard it from his coworker than to hear it from ""the other woman"".
Then again, the chances of me believing the coworker were slim to none.
Start being a cockblocker.
Seriously, when he's messing with someone that isn't his wife..try bringing her up.
That's what real bros should do.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
When someone comes out with mental health issues it should be taken seriously. People have the ability to put on a mask to other people but nobody really knows what goes on inside their heads except them. I was 18 when I started suffering from paranoia (I am 32 now). It was a terrible experience and I would not wish it on anyone. I was later stabilised on medication which I will be on for the rest of my life. I now live a successful life. Young adulthood, especially around the age of 18, is a common time for mental health issues to develop. Please listen to your daughter and get her the help she needs.

After this pandemic is over, will you start wearing a mask when you're sick?
The pandemic has definitely raised my awareness of contagious diseases. If I was sick after pandemic is over I would be more likely to take off work and stay at home than go out and spread my illness to other people. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as wearing a mask but if I was out I would wash my hands before touching things and not cough if people were near me.

In my opinion it should be a personal choice. Now that everyone has had the option of getting vaccinated by not wearing a mask you are only putting the small minority at risk that voluntarily chose not to get the vaccine.

Make it clear that you won‚Äôt buy a new phone irrespective of he breaks it or keeps it. You may be say planning to buy a new phone 2 years later. If he really breaks it, let he live with the consequences and you must stick to what you said. Wait for those 2 years until you were planning to buy one. The experience will go a long way.

It‚Äôs not always easy to know if one has Mental issues. My mom did the same mistake when I was 19 delaying my therapy by 2 years until it got worse to worst. The delay resulted in a Post Traumatic disorder when issues surfaced again and when I was 38, almost 20 years later. Please trust her. Get a good therapist and the therapist will evaluate and let you know how to proceed.

My son is 16 years old and always crying. In arguments or when he‚Äôs just alone. I keep telling him to man up, but he still cries and panics all the time. How do I get him to be a man?
Hey maybe don‚Äôt be a jerk to your son? Crying is completely normal and has nothing to do with anyone‚Äôs gender. Don‚Äôt force him to bottle things up, that‚Äôs just terrible for his mental health. Crying is literally a good thing because you let things out. Don‚Äôt force your son to ‚Äòbe a man‚Äô because usually that ends up with guys becoming mentally ill man children who are complete jerks. I suggest you go to therapy and figure out what you have going on instead of forcing toxic masculinity down your sons throat. Also send your son to therapy so he can unlearn all the ‚Äòdon‚Äôt cry be a man‚Äô bullshit and doesn‚Äôt end up bottling everything up. Also a little warning if you keep doing stuff like that, your son may grow up to hate you, so maybe try to be a better parent before that happens.

Even if she doesn‚Äôt have mental health issues, it would still be good for her to see a therapist. Therapy can help even if someone doesn‚Äôt have any mental illnesses. That being said, she could very well be struggling with her mental health. Please pay attention and believe her because these issues could be recent or she could‚Äôve been hiding symptoms. As someone who finds it very difficult to talk to my parents about my mental heath, if don‚Äôt believe her she may not come to you in the future for the support and help she needs. It took until I was 13 for her to start noticing that I was struggling with my mental health even though she‚Äôs a therapist. If your daughter says she‚Äôs struggling, please take her seriously because she really could be struggling and you just hadn‚Äôt noticed. Not all sy‚Ä¶

The reality is that this age is terribly difficult. And right now our culture is in turmoil! Help her find someone to talk to that you think will actually help. After seeing many counselors as a kid I needed someone to point me to Christ and all the others were a waste of time because I wouldn‚Äôt actually tell anyone what was wrong. It‚Äôs big that she is asking and generally a good thing to talk to someone! Support her.

I am somone who Wears extremely heavy makeup- bordering on ‚Äòdrag‚Äô I wear eyelashes/huge wings, half shaved drawn high brows- I am the person your probably talking about lol!
There are a few reasons why I do it- the first is I find women attractive- so I model my appearance based on what my gaze finds attractive on another. My look has goth inspiration- I find heavy goth makeup very attractive. My Girlfriend also Wears heavy makeup (not as heavy as mine tbf, but still heavy to everyone else) my makeup attracted her, and I was drawn to her because of her makeup (at first) I want to attract a certain person basically.
The gay male gaze- my makeup style is often very popular in the LGBT clubs- especially with Gay men (my bffs have often been gay males). As somone who is socially awkward (not shy, but blunt and unintentionally unfriendly) my makeup is a form of communication. It's an icebreaker. LGBT are effortlessly warmer to me. I have made friends with strangers just for being ‚Äòfabulous‚Äô
3. I Am an ex theatre kid who loves to play with characterisation, costume & makeup. Early memories of playing with my mothers theatre makeup box. I have always had a strong connection to makeup.
4. I have always idolised heavily made up women or drag queens. As somone who struggled embracing the softer expectations of womanhood, I was inspired by feminity as somthing that wasn't soft, delicate and quiet. But I was inspired by loud, obnoxious and takes up space. Think Elvira, Dolly Parton, Lady Gaga, Pete Burns. It excites me and feels right. It feels me. It fills me with confidence.
No one should justify thier feminity and thier style. We are all different and like different things, it doesn't really matter why I chose to wear makeup. It's my journey, but I thought I would explain that makeup goes deeper and beyond the heterosexual male gaze. It is for a gaze for sure, primarily my own and the gaze and joy of my community.
Women use makeup and fashion as a way to communicate and express themselves. It is only questioned when the expectations of feminity are challenged. When it goes beyond what is deemed acceptable of feminity.
Instead of asking why she is wearing so much makeup- maybe instead question why it makes you feel so uncomfortable
Thanks for reading

You said you have always been skinny- I have been both. Obese child/early teen and slim/thin adult So let me share my perspective
I get that people get skinny shamed, but when people say its worse to be obese what they mean on top of that is how society is built for the slim, seats, cars, medical equipment e.c.t. MRI machines have a weight limit, safety testing. So it's not just about bullying and prejudices it's deeper than that. It's more than about treatment- its your existence being a complete inconvenience.
I was an obese child (90s)- and not being able to fit into school uniform- or adult woman clothes for that matter‚Ä¶- it's a level of humiliation beyond the times I was called ‚Äòfat‚Äô or (now) ‚Äòyour too skinny eat more‚Äô
Its living in a world not made for you. I havnt been fat for a LONG time so I don't know what's changed. But that's what I remember
I promise I will take thin bullying over being fat ANY day, I have also been accused of bulimia, been told ‚ÄòI'm too skinny, need to eat more‚Äô an ex made fun of my pointy bones. E.c.t
The skinny hatred I believe comes from a place of resentment especially from women- they resent because its been sold to them as an ideal (fashion industry e.c.t) I would rather people be jealous of me than disgusted by me (as a young fat person people were verbally open about thier disgust of me)

Is it possible for animals to be transgender? Are transgender feelings something that occurs only in humans?
Hey! Ignore anyone who tells you otherwise because thier reply is not based on actual animal science only human social prejudice. Yes there are a multitude of transgender and assexual animals. Gender in the animal kingdom is not always binary and there have been cases of animals transitioning, from chickens to ducks to lions to fish and reptiles My curiosity about this first started when I saw a mallard duck that had both male and female plumage- I started doing research into intersex animals that then lead onto animals that had the ability to change gender, some cases involve the changing of sex organs, others are superficial external changes such as plumage. Google transgender in the animal kingdom and you will see the many species and evidence that only humans cling onto this idea that sex‚Ä¶

People with bpd are not stupid, some are hyper aware and can sniff out disingenuous behaviour. As part of my diagnosis I am supposed to be a black and white thinker. In times of stress, yes I do that.

Not all people with BPD are the same you know - as somone with diagnosed with BPD- I have never tried to actively destroy a relationship/ of cause drama, in fact I try to desperately fix a relationship/avoid drama- a bpd like me, at this age would not tolerate a narcassist. When I was younger, sure, I had many controlling exes I changed myself for to avoid being dumped, I even would tolerate abuse‚Ä¶ but to say that BPD and NPD deserve each other is kind of a cruel perspective as, many bpds like me have a history of sexual abuse & physical/emotional abuse.. I don't want drama, my brain is drama enough, all I want is security and to have my pain acknowledged and to get what I give‚Ä¶ I don't know why people are so nasty to borderlines, they have been through enough, I get they are not for everyone, clingyness scares some people and rejection of clingyness can result in negative swings. But it's cruel to say that, that kind of person deserves to continue a cycle of abuse‚Ä¶ its Just wrong.

So, social media isn't the evil here I don't believe. Ignorance is for sure. Its not about the information but how we process information.
Social media is dangerous if people do not have the ability to process information in a rational and logical way. Social media has alot of benefits such as isolated minorities, such as the LGBTQ community being able to communicate and feel validated in thier worlds. Same for other people, sharing of ideas, advice, positivity about mental health or disabilities. Also being able to communicate with people all over the world. I met my GF on social media. I understand that for many social media can be a toxic hole/echo chamber, however I think it comes down to the individual, and is not due to social media itself. If you get me?
Without social media you would not have even been able to post this. Your voice would be irrelevant. Social media has given you the ability to do so. Although I don't agree with many of the points, I would rather it existed, than didn't, as its important that voices other than those of people in influential positions are heard.
So yeah, in a nutshell, it's not social media, but the way in which we process the information we consume.

All people manipulate regardless of BPD or not. I dislike why people believe that only people with certain personalities are capable of manipulation. You are just as manipulative as me.

Is my depression legit if I can't bring myself to do self-harm?
Although self harming and depression can be overlapping they are different things
I get periods of depression alot, I also have a history of self harm and depression doesn't make me self harm, other things do
Alot of people with depression don't self harm so Don't let it make you feel less validated

Is seeing clear closed eye images psychosis?
No, I don't think so unless the images distort your reality. I have at times what you are talking about, where you can see a mind picture as if it's real, I get this mostly when I try to sleep, I will be awake eyes closed, still aware of myself, and start to see crystal clear motion or static pictures whilst still maintaining the wakeful awareness I also somtimes open my eyes and hear things or rarely see things- it's not psychosis, as I'm aware it's not real and it doesn't impose on my reality Why do I get them? Not sure, but the mind pictures started when I used to use dr*gs and they never went away, coincidence? Maybe. Yet my imagination has always been very strong. Moreover, although the images are often creepy/disturbing, I don't fear them and they are like a gift for me. If they don't h‚Ä¶

Why do some people act like BPD‚Äôs are the victims? My experience was awful with one. Are they just untreated self righteous BPDs that do it? I‚Äôve seen it on here, is why I‚Äôm asking?
You do realise not all people with bpd are the same? Not all symptoms look the same, not all bpd behave the same. Some may be hurtful, sure, but to tarnish a group of people based on your experience is really immature. It's like saying all people with ptsd are the same. Some people with ptsd may lash out at others, some may lash out at themselves. Same principle. Also most bpd people have actually been victim to terrible traumas, so why are we blaming the victim? I do not have a victim mentality, I believe the world isn't fair. But I have experienced a multitude of physically inflicted traumas and had my vulnerability taken advantage of‚Ä¶ so if I disconnect from reality and have a meltdown that makes me the awful person?

Can feeling non-human (Otherkin) be defined as a mental illness (identity crisis, schizotype‚Ä¶)? Why?
Depersonalisation & derealization applies to many mental health disorders, from anxiety to personality disorders. The fact you are posting this question means you have a level of awareness which is a good sign. Other than that I think it's normal for self aware people to question thier identity, bodies, existence‚Ä¶ I think it only comes an issue if it disturbs your reality. Like I experience depersonalisation and derealization but it's not constant and I see the positives in it (it's like an alternate state of being) it only becomes an issue if I get anxious & paranoid. So iv been told its only an issue if it disturbs your every day reality for a prolonged period e.g to paranoid to leave the house, aggressive behaviour. Losing job/relationship breakdown.

I don't fully agree with the similarities, I was diagnosed with BPD and I never blame others- I always blame myself, for everything. Lying gives me guilt and shame so intense that I can't carry it on. I also put others needs above me, like a partner, thier needs are more important than mine, always. Also I'm hyper self aware of displaying behaviour that may be manipulate- however I consider myself a quite type of bpd. As my anger is directed at myself and I don't hurt others, would give me too much guilt, would rather hurt myself. I don't know anyone else with bpd but from my experience, that's how it is

Somthing similar happened to me‚Ä¶ when I was 15 my school referred me to child mental health services. When my mum found out she flipped out and said there's nothing wrong with me and I was lying.

However my romantic partner, I cannot stop touching them. I'm obsessed with touching them all the time, and them touching me all the time, I will even want to hold hands around the house at times, luckily my partner loves it because physically I like to invade my partners space all the time, and I like that returned. Touching makes me feel loved. As a child I didn't feel loved or touched much‚Ä¶ I was a fat kid and everyone was disgusted by me. My mum wasn't very openly loving, my dad I suspect is autistic, or somthing. Based on his behaviours.

So now I hate touching my family, and have split love and hatred for them. People often only touched me to mock me, in my teens I faced various physical abuse. So to me touch is vulnerable.

The fact you feel this or think this is appalling. You need to get therapy not just for your daughter but for you as well. Children can note how you feel and I‚Äôm sure your child has lived with knowing you don‚Äôt love her as much. The damage is done though and that‚Äôs on you for sure. Honestly Anyone who says they can pick a favorite about their children just shouldn‚Äôt have had children.

Many people still watch shows from their childhood without issue. I just don‚Äôt see the issue.

as someone who has ADHD and depression myself, i would like to take the time to say that for the most part. your kids likely will not want to speak out about their problems, in fear of being mocked and the sort, even if that wouldn‚Äôt happen. if your child or children come to you about their mental health, take it seriously. it‚Äôs that type of reaction that causes them to bottle up, and i am certain you would much rather have had to bring her to a couple therapy appointments for minimal reason than end up being in the wrong and losing your kid.

yes, but the point being made is that it‚Äôs a lot more straightforward than with that of Linux, which has more Ubuntu-esque distros than i‚Äôm willing to list, and we‚Äôre only touching a portion of the Debian-based distros at that.
for the most part, Windows has a lot more backwards compatibility (provided vendors are willing to update broken links or what have you) and has one universal .EXE file for install rather than having a .DEB, .RPM, or .TAR.GZ that you need to install/unpack/whatever.
as they said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶an app built for Linux typically can‚Äôt be deployed like that unless you first install all of its dependencies globally in a package-manager-specific way... often having built them from sources.‚Äù especially if you‚Äôre trying to just get a program working, there are many more factors in play for a Linux system than there are a Windows one, and that‚Äôs not even getting into Arch vs Debian vs whatever else.

short answer: yes, you can, as long as you had a Microsoft account signed in‚Ä¶ but it isn‚Äôt recommended to get a blank laptop. long answer: buying a laptop without an OS is kinda odd, especially if you‚Äôre already looking to have Windows 10 on it. if it were a damaged drive, sure, getting a new one and re-installing is cool, but you‚Äôre better off just getting a new one with 10 pre-installed. in the meantime, assuming you don‚Äôt have the physical key, your answer; Windows included the ability since 8 to use the digital keys made when you set up a key for the first time ‚Äî it‚Äôs tied to your Microsoft account (provided you signed in with one). when setting up Windows, you can select ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a product key‚Äù. once you get through setup, go to Settings under the Windows Update category and go to‚Ä¶

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Please believe your children child when they say they need she says she needs help. She is the only person who knows if she‚Äôs mentally fine or not. One of my best friends had tried to kill herself several times when we were in high school. She kept hearing voices in her head but her dad was a drunk (and still is) so he didn‚Äôt give a shit, and her mom who‚Äôs a religious freak kept saying she was seeking attention at school and that she‚Äôs perfectly fine when she‚Äôs at home. My friend took her life a month after graduation.

Ok first thing, if your child says they are suffering from mental illness believe them!!!! You may not know if they actually have anything severe till they are diagnosed but if they say they are suffering that should be enough to cause concern. Remember you are not a doctor, you do not know everything your child is going through. Mental illness can often times be hard to notice since it is an internal struggle. Also chances are your child has been thinking about this for a while and had to build up the bravery to ask you about it and if your immediate reaction was to not believe them i think you owe them an apology. I wish the best for you and your child I know how scary and confusing mental illness can be <3

It he best thing to do is to let your daughter see a therapist. i don‚Äôt mean anything negative about how to raised your daughter, but I can tell you about how I was raised and what happened when I brought up my mental health issues to my parents when I turned 18. I was a very private kid. my parents were strict on rules and very religious. in my mind, i had it down that i had to keep everything to myself because religion would ‚Äúsave me‚Äù and my parents had never talked to me about that type of stuff before so i wasn‚Äôt comfortable speaking up until i was an adult and able to make my own decisions. I knew i needed help and that i had some issues, but i was trying to keep up the ‚Äúperfect child‚Äù role that my parents somehow tried to fit me in. i went to a doctors appointment shortly after my 18th b‚Ä¶

My daughter has never felt safe discussing her mental health issues and I have not noticed the signs, and now that she is 18, she feels empowered to make decisions about her own care.
Fixed it for you.
CW: The signs have likely been there. I was literally suicidal at 12 years old but my parents just thought I was a brat and punished me for my ‚Äúattitude.‚Äù Take some interest in your child and have compassion.

What in the actual fuck is wrong with you? Seriously? Assuming this isn't a troll post, she's probably crying herself to sleep because she has such a monstrously evil parent!!! Parents who punish their children for normal emotional expression are everything that is wrong with the world. When I was 12, I was severely depressed due to a number of reasons (one being that my dearly beloved great grandparents both passed and the entire family had a huge falling out and split apart. I was devastated). You're a TERRIBLE parent.

My 16-year-old teen son is asking how babies are made. What should I tell him?
I'm sorry, what..? 16? You haven't had this talk with him yet? Yeah, it's definitely time. He probably already knows but is using that as a segue to get a dialogue started with his parent. Since you haven't initiated it, he's doing it the only way he knows how.
My parents had a light version of the talk when I was 12, and explained much more when I was 14. They had me when they were teenagers, and they wanted to be sure their kids were pretty well informed.

How do I confront my daughter about the mean things she said about me to her therapist through a video call that I overheard from her room?
This would be an excellent time to do some self-reflection. I'm thinking, just based on the fact that you're listening in to her therapy, she's most likely justified in saying ‚Äúmean"" (ahem, true things that you don't like hearing) things about you. Check yourself.

I don't doubt you are responsible and mature. There are 14 yr old girls who are very mature, and I was one. But you should wait. Wait until you are a little older, in a solidly stable situation, and able to care for a child. Having a baby is a HUGE life change and will affect your entire life. It will be much better if you do, you can give your child a better life and have a better life yourself.

Why do fathers with 0% custody have to pay child support? Shouldn‚Äôt it be the other way around? If a mother gets 100% custody, she should have to compensate the father for not getting to see his kids.
what a stupid f***ing question. Child support is not for the adults, it‚Äôs for the children. And while I suspect this is rage bate, I‚Äôll indulge you anyway. The children are entitled to child support, not the parent. If you want shared custody of your children, there is no reason you should have zero custody, unless the court has deemed you an unfit parent for some reason. The mother does not make the choice for you to have zero custody, the court does. This whole question reeks of incompetent narcissist.

I saw a woman unpack and eat one pastry at a supermarket before checking out. I am not sure the woman had paid already. Should I have reported this to the store immediately?
No, leave her alone. Plenty of people snack while they eat. She‚Äôs probably going to pay for the package at checkout with the rest of her stuff. I open stuff and eat it while I‚Äôm shopping once in a while if I‚Äôm really hungry, and I always pay for it at checkout. Mind your business and move along. People like you are the reason I hate the grocery store.

I have never known a male narc, but that‚Äôs mostly what people talk about all over the internet. My experience is that female narcs are a particularly vicious breed.

It probably already has, every single day. These people try so hard to convince the world that their life is perfect, but a peek behind the curtain would reveal just how messed up it actually is. They make things as hard as they can be for themselves, and they draw in constant negativity. Rest assured knowing that at least she‚Äôs miserable lol.

Is Lucy Letby innocent?
No, no she is not innocent. She is a child killer who likes to watch the parents suffer and participate in their grief.

This answer is nonsense. Men don‚Äôt ALWAYS come back. Many men move onto a new relationship and never look back. If he‚Äôs a narcissist who can‚Äôt find happiness within and is experiencing a dry spell, then he may come back for a source of supply. Same goes for women.

Punish? Definitely not. Thanks for bringing this up! Apologies if the last paragraph or two came across that way.
I‚Äôd first like to acknowledge that, in everyday life, the silence we may have experienced may most often be associated with ‚Äúthe silent treatment‚Äù from someone; and that ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äù is often meant to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù us in some way for a ‚Äúwrongdoing.‚Äù The use of silence in therapy is not intended to be ‚Äúthe silent treatment‚Äù to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù a client; although an individual could certainly perceive it that way as that‚Äôs what we may be accustomed to in everyday life. We‚Äôll come back to that later‚Ä¶
With that said, I personally rarely use silence because that‚Äôs not my style. My response provided a couple different possibilities. We don‚Äôt know what happened in the session that led the OP to ask this question. However, it‚Äôs important to consider that every therapist, every client, and every session is different, and there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all approach to therapy. Trying to encapsulate all possibilities in a single response is impossible.
In short, readiness and response to therapy is based on a lot of factors; and it‚Äôs certainly not a linear process. Here are some additional considerations:
Yes, there are some great therapists, some really poor therapists, and a whole lot of in-between. Most people benefit in some way from therapy.
There are so many different approaches to/styles of therapy, and the approaches may or may not include the use of silence. Silence doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and that‚Äôs okay.
Not every therapist and client are a good fit, and that‚Äôs okay. Not every therapeutic approach works for a client‚Äôs needs, and that‚Äôs okay. There are lots of therapists ‚Äúin the sea.‚Äù Sometimes it takes some ‚Äúfishing around‚Äù to find the right fit; that can be frustrating yet so-worth-it when you find ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù (This same idea goes for any kind of medical or mental health provider - not every provider is created equally, nor equally helpful. When you find ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù though, it can be such a relief!)
Some people may be forced to go to therapy (e.g., kids/teens whose parents make them go to therapy, court-ordered clients, people who received an ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù to go to therapy from someone else) and they may not want to participate at all, or they may not feel ready for it.
In the US, in particular, we‚Äôre used to the medical model of treatment. You go to a doctor when you‚Äôre sick. They ask specific questions, and you get quick treatments. (‚ÄúDo you have these symptoms?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, take this and you‚Äôll feel better in a week.‚Äù) Therapy is not like that, and therapists may not have the ‚Äúmagic questions.‚Äù Sometimes it just takes safety, support, silence, and time before things emerge or the client is ready to ‚Äúgo there.‚Äù
Some people may be new to therapy and not know what to expect. Others may be ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù therapy clients and have established expectations based on their prior experiences, so they may be taken aback by a therapist who uses significant silence if that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre accustomed to experiencing.
Some people may need silence in order to get away from the everyday hustle and bustle. Some people may need to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù in therapy before they feel comfortable discussing things and, sometimes, allowing silence and space for that to occur can be best. Some people may need silence to collect their thoughts or decide if they want to ‚Äúgo there.‚Äù
A therapist firing off questions if a client isn‚Äôt ready, doesn‚Äôt want to discuss anything, or simply doesn‚Äôt want to be there is likely going to backfire. Sometimes silence is best. The client is still there and may be benefitting from the silence in some way; or, perhaps, the client may bring up something about the silence (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat are we doing in silence here?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want to ask me something?‚Äù) which offers an opportunity for discussion.
All of the above are just food-for-thought and are certainly not comprehensively covering all-the-things.
To more specifically address your example of a client with severe depression, here‚Äôs an example scenario (it‚Äôs certainly not the only possibility, but just one example):
If I, as a therapist, come at an individual with ‚Äú100 questions‚Äù who is depressed and just needs space to be in a safe and supportive environment or they‚Äôre not ready to ‚Äúgo there‚Äù yet I keep firing questions -- it‚Äôs going to backfire. That‚Äôs not going to be therapeutic; it will likely lead the client to feel worse or more overwhelmed, and is likely to cause the individual to further shut-down. Especially considering if all a client could do that day was get out of bed and come to therapy, and that‚Äôs all the ‚Äúspoons‚Äù (this is referencing the ‚ÄúSpoon Theory‚Äù for anyone who may not be familiar) they had to give, sometimes just allowing them to be in silence can be a relief to them. (See also: the paragraph that starts with ‚ÄúSome therapeutic approaches encourage the use of silence in a safe space‚Äù for other possible benefits of the use of silence.)
On the flipside, silence can certainly cause uneasiness or discomfort (as it does for most of us). If the silence is not supportive and leads the client to feel worse, that is something the client can bring up and discuss in therapy. This comes back to the participation piece - discussing concerns or experiences in therapy so that the therapist can understand the client‚Äôs experience and better help them work through that. If the client does not feel comfortable with the silence, they may choose to do a variety of things, such as (these are just possibilities):
discuss their discomfort with the silence with the therapist (if they feel safe bringing that up with their therapist),
confront the therapist with their feelings of being ‚Äúpunished‚Äù by the therapist using the ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äô (if that‚Äôs their experience) as that will offer lots of great substance to explore in therapy,
bring up something that they‚Äôd like to discuss with their time in therapy,
talk about the weather or whatever else they‚Äôd like to if they feel the need to break the silence, or
frankly, elect to find a different therapist who may be better suited for them because that therapist‚Äôs approach may not be helpful to the client.
Tons and tons of possibilities here! I hope this offers some clarity and some different things to consider.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
TL;DR: What should you do?

Let me first respond as a parent‚Ä¶ Having a child share that they‚Äôre struggling and want to speak with a therapist (especially when it seems sudden) can be confusing, shocking, scary, overwhelming, etc. Add to it that you, as a parent, have never noticed any overt signs or symptoms often only adds to the shock or confusion‚Ä¶ and these can easily lead to doubt or denial.

Why does my therapist we‚Äôve been working for 12 sessions ask ‚Äúdo you have anything in mind you want to talk about‚Äù? I always reply with ‚ÄúI have nothing in mind‚Äù.
Generally speaking, people begin and continue in therapy for a reason: there‚Äôs something they‚Äôre hoping to alleviate, learn, grow from, or improve in their lives. Therapy is goal-directed, meaning that therapeutic treatment goals are discussed and set toward the beginning of therapy, and treatment is tailored to help the client work toward those goals. While this is true for my work with clients, I still start out just about every session with some variation of the ‚Äúdo you have anything in mind‚Ä¶‚Äù question, such as: * ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been going on?‚Äù * ‚ÄúBring me up to speed on what you‚Äôve experienced since last session.‚Äù * ‚ÄúIs there anything, in particular, you‚Äôd like to discuss today?‚Äù * ‚ÄúIt looks like there‚Äôs something on your mind today.

Is it normal for a therapist to make you sit in silence for 30 minutes because she ran out of questions?
Is it normal to sit in silence for a full 30 minutes in therapy? I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say that. Can silence serve a therapeutic purpose? Yes, absolutely.

From a different aspect: Yes, parents can get their minor child(ren) into therapy for reasons which are more a result of the parents‚Äô issues than the child‚Äôs; in most cases, however, there is a valid reason or topic(s) to focus on with the minor client. Even if the former is the case, the focus of therapy could be exploring family dynamics, normalizing/validating the client‚Äôs experience, and identifying how to interact with the parent(s) differently for the minor client‚Äôs benefit. For instance, a parent may have skewed expectations or parenting styles which have a negative impact on the way they interact with the child. This could, in turn turn, backfire causing even more problematic behaviors with the child than the parent intends.

When it comes to Emotional Support Animal (disability) assessments, the individual is assessed and not the animal itself. With that being said, a bird (parrot) can certainly be identified by the individual with a disability as alleviating one or more disability-related symptoms.

You're absolutely right that is difficult to find local providers who are competent and confident in providing ESA assessments and letters. I often have individuals reach out to me from across the nation who are desperately seeking a provider licensed in their state.
While, in its simplest form, ESA work seems rather straightforward, there's a lot more to it behind the scenes. Medical and mental health professionals need to have competence in the area of work related to ESAs, and balance laws, licensure laws, professional ethics, and liability all while having a solid policy and procedure in place to hide their work.
ESA accommodations are still relatively new, so many providers have never had an opportunity to receive training on the necessary information. Given that, many providers do not feel competent and confident in providing these services. With that said, myself and some others out there are offering trainings to professionals to help increase the number of ESA competent providers, thereby allowing individuals greater access to have their needs met and decreasing the draw of the illegitimate letters purchased online.
Feel free to have your friend reach out to me if I can be of assistance.

I didn't see a description on your profile to know whether or not you are a clinician, so I'm not certain which way to frame my response to you. I will write this in a non-clinical frame and hope that it provides clarification either way.
It is always advisable for the client who is requesting an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) designation for their animal to know the specific letter requirements for the housing authority, airline carrier, college/university, etc. for which they plan to use their ESA. This can greatly help guide the process from the outset.
The transportation(dot)gov document you shared has a primary focus on the definitions of service animal across the different regulations, but it is somewhat helpful for understanding ESA requirements. Beginning on page 6 under the Air Carrier Access Act column, the ACAA‚Äôs recommended documentation points for ESAs are listed. While the HUD column doesn‚Äôt detail specific requirements, it does indicate that there needs to be ‚Äúreliable information verifying a disability and the disability-related need for an assistance animal.‚Äù¬ù With that, my recommendations include points from the ACAA, HUD, and what many residential schools/colleges/universities require for requests for reasonable disability accommodations (including ESAs).
To understand the mental health professions, it is important to know that mental health providers have to abide by laws/rules governing their licensing board and other applicable laws/rules (such as service/support/assistance animals), as well as ethical guidelines for practice. Across the different mental health professions, mental health treatment is considered confidential, meaning that mental health providers (and their related staff) can neither confirm nor deny whether or not they know or treat a person(s), or any other details about treatment without specific written permission from the client.
The items I recommended for inclusion in an ESA letter are commonly listed items on a Release of Information (ROI) form. An ROI is a form for which the client authorizes the disclosure/release of certain protected health information to a third party. These items are to be discussed and authorized at a client‚Äôs request. Ethical providers know to disclose the minimum amount of information necessary to facilitate coordination of care for their clients; therefore, it does not mean that the provider will automatically give great detail, but rather an acknowledgement of the items for inclusion to verify the ESA recommendation. Many providers actually write letters such as this in their client‚Äôs presence, co-write the letter together with their client, and/or provide the client with a preview of the letter/discussion of its contents before it‚Äôs ever disclosed. Given this, in general, the client knows what is being disclosed in support of the client‚Äôs wishes, transparency, and preservation of the therapeutic relationship.
Speaking to the ACAA recommendations, here‚Äôs what that boils down to:
1. ‚ÄúThe passenger has a mental or emotional disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM IV)‚Äù¬ù [This refers to my recommendation of disclosing ‚ÄúA diagnosed mental health condition‚Äù¬ù];
2. ‚ÄúThe passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination‚Äù¬ù [This refers to my recommendation of disclosing ‚ÄúA description of the treatment you have received for that condition and your response to treatment (i.e., if it helpful)‚Äù¬ù (or treatment plan and outcome)];
3. ‚ÄúThe individual providing the assessment is a licensed mental health professional, and the passenger is under his or her professional care‚Äù¬ù [This would include ‚ÄúTreatment dates‚Äù (and, it‚Äôs important to know that some letters need to be ‚Äúrecent‚Äù or within one year)¬ù]; and
4. ‚ÄúThe date and type of the mental health professional's license and the state or other jurisdiction disability in which it was issued,‚Äù¬ù which is a given any time that a mental health provider sends correspondence.
If you review the following HUD document, https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/SERVANIMALS_NTCFHEO2013-01.PDF], you will see that HUD indicates that a ‚Äúreasonable accommodation‚Äù¬ù for an emotional support animal is that the animal ‚Äúalleviates one or more identified symptoms or effects of a person‚Äôs disability (p. 2).‚Äù¬ù To validate this would mean to indicate that an ESA is part of their recommended treatment plan to better achieve the client‚Äôs goals or treatment outcome.
I have added, what I believe, is an important piece to the minimum recommended information, which is the ‚Äúevaluation of your fitness to be able to provide appropriate care for the animal.‚Äù¬ù For ethical providers, it is important to have real conversations with a client about whether or not they believe they can care for the animal and that they understand the laws, rules, and procedures regarding ESAs. For instance, are they aware of the ACAA‚Äôs laws pertaining to flying with ESAs within or outside of the U.S.A., where they should seek to have their animals relieve themselves, etc.? Are they aware that ESAs are only permitted ‚Äúin all areas of the premises where persons are normally allowed to go,‚Äù¬ù unless there is undue financial/administrative burdens, risk of damage that cannot be met by another reasonable accommodation, or health/safety issues of others? Are they aware that vaccinations and local licensing/registration of their animal still applies and that vests, etc. are not necessary? Are they aware that some states have laws against misrepresentation of their animal? Not only is this type of information important for the client to understand, but it‚Äôs also important for a therapist‚Äôs liability to make it known that this type of discussion occurred.
The current legislation can be tricky to decipher and it is difficult to say there is one ‚Äúrecipe,‚Äù¬ù but these items for inclusion in a letter cover the vast majority of the ‚Äòbases‚Äô for verifying the recommendation for an ESA. Again, this doesn‚Äôt have to be detailed information ‚Äî the letter can be super vague or a provide a bit more information as necessary ‚Äî but these items should typically be covered. Here‚Äôs an example of what a letter could look like whether it be vague or have a bit more detail. Certainly, elements from the HUD Sample Letter you provided could be added if desired.
‚Äú[Client Name] meets criteria for/has been diagnosed with [a DSM-5 mental health condition/panic disorder/depression‚Ä¶]. [Client Name] has participated in [individual counseling/CBT/‚Ä¶] for this condition and has been under my care from [Treatment Begin Date] to [Treatment End Date/Present]. While [Client] has made some progress during this time, it is my professional opinion that [Client] can better reach their therapeutic goals with the assistance of an Emotional Support Animal, as the animal will alleviate or reduce one or more symptoms associated with their mental health disability. [Client] reports being aware of the applicable laws, rules, and procedures related to the use of an ESA and relatedly reports that they are able to provide appropriate care for the animal.‚Äù¬ù
This demonstrates a very simplified (one paragraph) letter that speaks to all points I recommended in my original post. I hope this helps clarify. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me directly for a consultation!

The document you shared is for service animals, not Emotional Support Animals. ESAs are different, as they are not trained to perform a specific task(s), and are not afforded special rights. The document you shared includes some information on the bottom of page 6 which is the minimum requirement to be shared. Many people are not well-versed in the differences of support and service animals, and therefore do not understand the differences in requirements. Any information shared for ESA documentation is always discussed and authorized by the client in advance.

What did a family member say or do that you don't talk to them anymore?
‚Äúhey, this is just for my pride, but earlier you weren't responding to anything I said, so I have to know; I did hurt you, right?‚Äù This question wasn't the immediate cause of the estrangement, but this was the turning point for me and my biological mother. Background: I was moving out into my first apartment at 25. I had my own full time job for a couple of years at that point. My biological mother demanded I put a gps-tracking app on my phone so she could always see where I was, and I refused. She was incensed, and that first weekend I was living on my own, I kept on getting messages from the rest of the family still living with her that she was making their lives miserable.

How do you define love, and is it a feeling or a choice?
Love is a form of devotion based on positive feelings towards another human, object or idea. Love is a series of chemical reactions in your brain when faced with a pleasing person, object, action or idea that sets off the first part of that cascade. Love for a human, IMO, is part choice, part design. You can't make yourself love someone who doesn't and never has and never will set off those reactions. However, I strongly believe you do choose, every day, whether you are open to seeing those positive overtures, actions, gestures, etc, from someone as pleasing or not. Say, you love someone and have loved them for 6 months, and they have a habit of laughing a certain way. You feel a positive rush when they laugh in this way, and you want to make them laugh more. That is a spark of love. Over ti‚Ä¶

I would reach out to the following people: 1) the school's guidance counselor, 2) the same advocacy center that helped you last year, 3) the principal, 4) the department that holds on to your records, 5) your legal guardians. Explain to them whats going on. Also request proof from the secretary of the school/ guidance counselor of the records being in the school. Request to see your file asap. Any emails that you have confirming details on the documents between you or someone on behalf of you and the school will help too.
If, for whatever reason, you don't have this proof or can't get it, request a copy of every single bit of documentation with the dates of initial creation on them (so you can show these documents had been created some time in the past); copy them so you have the documents as well. Then, supply the documents again in triplicate to the school, citing that, according to the vice principal, they aren't in your records, so you wanted to make sure they had plenty of copies. Ensure you have proof of that interaction by requesting an email confirmation that all of your documents were placed in your records.

For the same reason anyone chooses one life path over another; because it will make her happy.
I understand wanting to keep the same therapist once you trust them and have opened up to them, but therapists are people too. They are people who's job it is to help other people in the way of psychiatry, and clearly she did her darnedest to connect to you and help you, but like‚Ä¶ you're a job to her.
You aren't family, you aren't friends. You aren't going to go drinking on a Friday night or celebrate her birthday with her. You're a folder she closes at the end of the day and walks away from.
That is a callous way to put it,but I can't think of another way to say it. Her job is only part of her life, and she is choosing to prioritize a different part now. Thats not a betrayal or a loss any more than when anyone else quits their job to move or to go to a new company or to have a family.
I think you need to breathe and put some emotional distance between you and her. Yes you've opened up to her and clearly feel safe with her, but on your end a therapist is a tool; a living breathing thinking tool to help you pick apart your hardships and help teach you how to build yourself up. Eventually one of you was going to leave this dynamic one way or another.

Do crystals have the ability to heal physical and mental illnesses like depression and anxiety?
Depends on who you ask. Some people legitimately believe that they will, some don't. There is science to suggest that just the act of believing something will help does, in fact, create a positive change, so it might if you believe it will. I wouldn't have it be your only tool in your toolbox though.

What happens when a self-harm safety plan fails? How do I tell my therapist I failed?
Just be honest with your therapist. Tell them what you did, and they'll probably start a conversation about what led to the self-harm.
Just so you know, you didn't fail. Healing from any mental illness is a rocky journey- it doesn't happen cleanly, or quickly. Everyone is expected to mess up, fall back onto bad habits, have an outburst, etc, because healing a mind is hard. The only true failure would be if you fell onto old patterns and gave up trying to get better.
You'll be ok.

If our mother, who has passed away, abused us as children, do they make amends & understand their own mental illness after they pass away?
It depends on what you believe. If you believe in an afterlife, the. They would at least understand. As far as repentance, that depends. Do you think your parents would have repented if they really understood your pain while alive?
This might be a better question for a priest than Quora. No one can really help you here since no one knows what you believe, and you'll get all kinds of beliefs here.

Why doesn't MM appear to have mental health issues at the moment with all the anger towards her going on? I would have thought it was much worse for her now than before when she said the media made her so ill?
So I think the answer lies in your question, honestly. She ‚Äúsaid"" that she was struggling with mental health issues, but we never got to *see* them. She hid them, and she probably is now. She was a career actress, after all- it was literally her job to manipulate the emotions that show on her face.
And if you think about it, she has a lot of great reasons to hide her emotions. The Royal Family probably really want their errant son back, and they have a ton of power and influence. If she even shows the slightest hint of being unstable, they'd probably try to take her child away or lock her up in an asylum, or have her locked into a conservatorship a la Britney Spears and Amanda Bynes.

Just because you haven‚Äôt seen any symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist or haven‚Äôt existed for a long time. The thing with mental health issues is that those with them 1) may not realize they‚Äôre *that* bad and therefore may not believe they need to tell anyone or need help, and 2) they might feel an incredible amount of shame and therefore be unwilling to speak about how they‚Äôre feeling. Also, mental health issues come with a wide variety of possible symptoms- it‚Äôs quite possible you have noted your child acting differently, but didn‚Äôt associate those symptoms with mental illness. I encourage you to get her the help she needs. There is no harm in doing so if she doesn‚Äôt have mental health issues. If she is struggling, you‚Äôre risking her mental and physical health becoming much more damaged b‚Ä¶

Oh trust me she's known and has most likely been waiting to be a legal adult to get diagnosed. Listen to her. Support her and help her through the process, just bc you've never seen any symptoms does not mean she doesn't have any. There's so many different ways ppl cope with knowing smth is wrong with them and so many different signs. Please do your research and get her to a psychologist. Get her into therapy.

There is NO shame in seeing a therapist. I have hidden the many symptoms of anxiety, self hatred, etc for 19 years of my life, and finally started seeing a therapist at the age of 20. I was scared of my parents reaction, but needed to do what is right for me.

As someone who has experienced mental health issues as a teenager and beyond, dismissing how she feels is the worst thing you can do. Regardless of what you have seen, she evidently feels that she has difficulties she wants to work through, and being able to say that takes self-awareness and courage, so you evidently did something right! After going through therapy myself, I can honestly say that I believe everyone would benefit from therapy, whether that be a few sessions or numerous. Just like a general check-up we normally get for physical health, the same understanding should be applied to mental health. Seeing a good therapist will certainly do no harm and likely do her a whole lot of good, EVEN if she doesn‚Äôt have serious mental health issues as you believe. Ultimately, I‚Äôm sure any pa‚Ä¶

I obsessively write down everything my therapist told me during our sessions, every single word I remember. What could be the meaning behind this behavior?
From my perspective, I would say there is a balance. When I was in therapy, I also took notes after appointments. However, I only noted down a few things that she/we had said which felt like important learning points, or things she had said which I needed to remind myself of in the future. When I finished therapy, it was really helpful to have these notes. They were both comforting and helpful in my progress. Is perhaps there is an in between that you can find.

I got my helix pierced 3 days ago. When I clean it in the shower, I move it forward/backward to clean around the piercing. It bleeds slightly, but should I do this? If I don't move it, then I can't get right up to the hole to clean it.

Why does my therapist get heavy eyes during out session as if he‚Äôs about to fall asleep? It makes me feel as if he‚Äôs bored with me or finds me unimportant.
Absolutely, bring it up with her. I had the same experience when I was in therapy; one session, my psychologist looked like she was nodding off! I brushed it off as she was tired, and sure enough, not long afterwards she was off sick. When she returned, she told me she found out she was anaemic because she'd been feeling really tired all the time. So, what I'm trying to say is chances are, she was tired and having a rough day. Just remember that for all we know, she's just had a bad nights sleep!
Best wishes.

What do you look for in a therapist?
I didn't ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for my therapist as I was referred to see them through the NHS (UK) so didn't really have any option who I saw. However initially, I saw a mental health nurse then transitioned to seeing a psychologist the majority of the time. So if it really hadn't worked with the psychologist, I suppose I could have stayed with the nurse. As someone who had a very positive experience with a therapist, I can say that if I were to return to therapy privately in the future, I would look for someone with a character; not too sweet, has a sense of humour! I would want them to be quick-minded, honest, kind, probably female (I would want a more maternal figure), empathic and to show they genuinely care. I also liked that my previous therapist did share some more personal experiences when it a‚Ä¶

Why do some clients sit really close to their therapist and/or psychologist?
I have personally always preferred to sit in one of the chairs close to my therapist but also facing her (e.g not the seat right beside if it's not facing her, but one along from there). I would say this is because It feels more personal and like a normal conversation too. I feel more connected being near people. Also, you wouldn't sit far away from someone normally, so why would you in therapy? I think it would just feel awkward.

Have you ever wanted to chat with your therapist/coach in-between sessions? For example, if you had a paid option to text your practitioner when you're having an emotional roller-coaster and would love them to answer you back as soon as they can.
Yes, I have wanted to communicate with my therapist between sessions. When I first started therapy with a MH nurse, I had weekly appts plus a phone call in between as I had just been in hospital from an overdose. The phone call appt was then cut out, but if I really felt I needed to contact her, I could phone the reception, and she would call me back when she had time, either that day or the next. I then switched to seeing a clinical psychologist whom I could still call, but she also allowed me to email her if I needed or to organise appts etc. Generally a quick email from her was enough to help instead of a call as time went on. This may not work for some, but she knew that I would not abuse the privilege and email all the time. She would only respond within working hours as it was her work email too. As time went on and I struggled less, I also emailed less, and if she didn‚Äôt reply, I knew it was because she was pushing me to cope on my own and knew I didn‚Äôt urgently need her. Before contacting, I always considered whether I would be fine soon and could wait until our sessions, or if I genuinely needed support right then.

Is it ok to text my therapist and tell her I miss her? We are doing attachment work and I miss her a lot between sessions, but she has encouraged me to text if I need to.
If I were in your position, I would text her, but also explain that you felt unsure whether it would be ok. This way, she understands the whole picture I‚Äôd how you‚Äôre feeling. Just want to say, I felt the exact same way as you; I missed my therapist so much between sessions, but over time and as we worked through things, it became less difficult. My therapist had to move departments at the end of March, and it‚Äôs been so hard having to let go of her, but that attachment is important in order to be able to work well in therapy, particularly as you‚Äôre doing attachment work. I‚Äôm so glad I built such a good relationship with my therapist, and wouldn‚Äôt choose to have no attachment to her, despite the loss I felt when she left; it was 100% worth it for how much it changed my life.

Can you hug your therapist on your last day?
It really depends on the therapist. Generally physical contact is not seen as ethically right. However, it seems that many make an exception in circumstances like final sessions. I would say asking in an appt prior to the final one whether this would be ok is the best thing to do. That way, you don‚Äôt feel hurt and confused in your last appt if they say no. It would allow you to work through that. For my final appt (she had to move away to another department), we had the session at a cafe as suggested by her. I picked the place, we met up and it was so lovely. We chatted about unimportant, light-hearted things, like her dog and terrible neighbour! We both gave one another a gift, and she asked if she could give me a hug and I said yes. For someone like me who finds physical contact a massive part of showing that you care for someone, this was a really meaningful gesture. As we left and said goodbye for the last time, I asked if I could hug her, we hugged and I had to watch with so many mixed emotions as she walked away. I‚Äôm so glad that I had her in my life and that she understood me so well, but it was so hard to say goodbye‚Ä¶

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
My advice is that she's better safe than sorry. Help her with organising therapy for a few months and if the therapist says she's fine then she is. But don't forget, therapists aren't always right. Many wrongly diagnose too.

Your son is just being a normal teenager. There is no need to worry about them. If he is playing videogames that long then he just wants some time to play instead of work, especially if he is doing well in school and doing homework. There is a crappy stereotype that videogames are bad in all situations. This isn't the case. Just that maybe he wants to have a break from the stress of school. Maybe feels overworked? Obviously you should check up on him though. You don't need videogames as an excuse for that. As his parent, that is your job. ‚Ä¶

I made a pun of ‚ÄúTRANSformers‚Äù to try to make trans people smile, but it backfired. What part of it is transphobic? (I‚Äôm autistic, so I‚Äôm naturally bad with this kind of stuff).
It probably depends on the delivery. Like, I for example have a deception shirt in trans pride colors, and I think it‚Äôs AWESOME! But context is everything. I think a lot of cis people who don‚Äôt deal with trans people a lot fall into this hole of, ‚Äúoh wow, this person‚Äôs different‚Äù and what they do is dwell on the trans thing until the trans person themself is uncomfortable with it. If they‚Äôre telling you something like this, that‚Äôs probably the reason why. You‚Äôre making them uncomfortable, and using a pun in that way, around someone who‚Äôs already starting to get weirded out is going to put it over the line.

Yes, unless it‚Äôs a commercial platform (something people might tune in to). That‚Äôs a different thing.
Role-playing for fun is about exploring and discovering things. Yes, you‚Äôre working through a story, but you‚Äôre learning stuff about yourself along the way. I would never tell anyone not to explore the things they‚Äôre interested in exploring.

Are trans women usually tomboys?
I think you probably mean trans men, but I‚Äôm going to answer this honestly, as asked. No. I‚Äôve always been feminine. HRT has made me more so. This is the case with 80% of the trans women I know. There might be an argument to be made that some trans women over-compensate in this department. Especially the baby trans who are just trying to get their footings in life. But I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything per se wrong with that. I have one local friend who‚Äôs a trans girl and a tomboy. She works on cars, swears like a sailor, doesn‚Äôt wear makeup, and generally doesn‚Äôt care about how she looks. But even she has her moments where she likes to be feminine, and she cleans up okay.

Because it is?
And because people are allowed to live their lives however they like? If they‚Äôre uncomfortable with the gender binary, they don‚Äôt have to conform to it. And if that makes you uncomfortable, good. I‚Äôm glad.
But comfortable or not, you do have to respect it. That‚Äôs the price of benefitting from a society that has everyone in it. Basic decency. And it‚Äôs free to do, takes almost no effort at all!
I think you‚Äôll probably get a lot of sociological and scientific explanations here, but I don‚Äôt think the effort to create an answer like that is warranted.
This is enough: It‚Äôs not your place to police someone else‚Äôs identity. And doing so is gouache as hell.

Why don't trans people realize I don't want their cisgender label? There is no such thing.
Because there are only two options. This is the fault of human language. You‚Äôre either cis, meaning that you identify with your assigned gender, or you‚Äôre trans. For the purpose of this conversation, that‚Äôs really all that means. If you‚Äôre talking about labels used to describe social status and privilege, and you don‚Äôt believe you are privileged, that‚Äôs an entirely different conversation

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Why would somebody like about this? It‚Äôs either she isn‚Äôt lying, and she needs help, or she is lying, and she still needs help and therapy because that isn‚Äôt something you lie about. When i was 13 i was extremely depressed and suicidal and went through a similar thing with my mom and the way she rejected me and made me feel like i was crazy and telling her this for attention destroyed our relationship. Nobody lies about this stuff. You can‚Äôt begin to understand how hard it is. Also, you are not a therapist, or a doctor, and you are not trained to recognize symptoms. It‚Äôs okay that you didn‚Äôt notice. But don‚Äôt continue to fail your daughter by denying her help when she is reaching out to you.

Why has Dan Howell stopped posting videos on YouTube?
I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs because he is working on his book, but it‚Äôs probably also because he is not as interested in it anymore. He has been distancing himself from his youtube career ever since the second tour ended, and I personally don‚Äôt think he will ever make a full comeback. Several of the reasons why may be that he doesn‚Äôt know what to make videos about anymore, he doesn‚Äôt want to be associated with the ‚Äòold dan‚Äô, he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the speculations about phan, and because the second he posts a video it will get a lot of attention. I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to make more youtube videos if I were you.

As a teenager (15) and gay, it's hard to fit in because I don't fit in the standards of a regular teenager. I don't know if I should act masculine or feminine. Do I not use enough social media or listen to the right music? How can I cope with this?
I'm not gonna go along with the bs that you are a regular teenager bc we both know you aren't. I'm 15 and bi, and some people know at school bc I have a gf, but not everyone and definitely not my parents. The thing you need to realize here, is that you don't have to masquerade as a regular teenager. You can listen to the music you like and people probably won't hear it and think you are gay (unless it's showtunes lmao). Assuming you are a dude, you should probably act masculine if you want to ""fit in"". Next, some people weirdly think that a guy using social media a lot is gay but that's just weird. I'd say as a guy a safe bet would probably just to post photos with your friends when you take pictures together and have your face as the profile pic. If your talking about sc, probably just do‚Ä¶

I don't want my cat anymore. Should I leave it on the street?
Then why did u bother getting a cat? Let me guess u got them as a kitten and now that they are an adult you are bored of them. They aren't a toy. They are apart of your family. Your responsibility.
Throwing them on the streets where they could gey severely sick and could starve to death is such a good idea. Not. üòë
Use ur brain and take them to a non kill shelter or give them to a friend or family member. Where they will be safe.

Mental illnesses are hidden illnesses. The symptoms are mostly in a person's head. For being emotion due to negative thoughts like suicidal thoughts for example, people that are feeling like that will cry alone e.c.t. in their bedroom or a safe place.
I would recommend take her to see the gp/doctor first. So she can get diagnosed properly so she can get the help she needs correctly for her mental health.

I recently discovered I have a friend who is bipolar and refuses to take her medication because she doesn‚Äôt think she needs it. She is an adult. What should I do?
It is a very hard decision to start taking medication for mental illnesses. I wanted to stop taking them a few times. Is there a way you could trick her into taking it? Try to support her through it.

Ah okay. So my self harm has gotten to the point now that I need to cut a bit more deeper just to get the same affect afterwards (feeling calmer and negative thoughts gone). I did one yesterday where it was sort of gaping a bit more than the others and it did hurt quite a bit, I will admit.
I just dont know what to do. I'm dreading summer even more due to this now as I know the scara are going to be more visible. I have tried so many alternatives and distractions e.c.t. but they dont really work. I am meant to be going back college (finally) because my mental health was really bad last month and I have had to have the time off to recover from my overdose.
I wont show my self harm as it is recent and i dont want to make people uncomfortable.

What‚Äôs the best way to cope with mental health if you‚Äôre unable to receive help at the moment?
Lots of self care like taking baths, washing ur face, making sure u eat and sleep enough. When I start to feel overwhelmed, especially with this lockdown in the UK because of the coronavirus, I usually do some gaming or try and focus on doing some college work. If I have already done college work that day then it's either gaming or having a nice warm bath. Also changing into every day clothes even tho it's a lockdown, really helps me. Makes you feel more fresh when you are out of your pjs.
I would recommend finding out things that you enjoy doing that distract you from your mental health. Maybe finding and learning new hobbies and interests will help as well.

Is it important that a student's school is notified of possible mental health issues?
Yes. If teachers and staff are aware, they will look after the student and make sure that they are safe. Some schools or most schools (in the uk not sure for anywhere else) have trained counsellors so students font have to have extra time out of school to go to counselling e.c.t.

Should I go to a mental hospital for self-harm and wanting to hurt animals?
I would say yes. They will try and give support and try to give you ways to cope. They might want to do a assessment to see if you have any other mental health problems.
They might put you under a section if they are really concerned about your safety and others. Depending on how serious your self harm is and your urges to hurt animals. Before you get put under a section, they will do a assessment to see what section you need to be on.
Try to go to one as soon as possible. The sooner the better for your safety.

Seeing someone so young self harming is really heartbreaking. It does show that mental illnesses can happen at any age.
I am currently getting bullied by my classmates In college so i know what it's like. But remember that when bullies are in a group, they feel hard and confident to upset you. But if a bully doesnt have his mates around them, they wont have the guts to come up to you. Just remember that they wont be in your life forever. They are just jealous, disgusting people.

Do you think it's insensitive to tell a 12-year-old questioning if they're non-binary to not let themselves get brainwashed by the elite to question their gender identity?
as a non binary 20 year old - i very much think this is insensitive. that is a child trying to understand and learn about themselves, if they feel they are non binary - let them be. what harm does their gender cause you? all they wish to do is exist and be who they want and need to be. if you disagree with their happiness you should not be apart of their self discovery journey. not only are you invalidating their feelings, but also ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù them into thinking they have to be a certain way. let this child be a child, let them discover themselves. they are doing no harm.
also, notice how using they/them pronouns isnt hard?

what should you do? Believe her. Mental illness is a serious thing, and coming from a daughter who had a mother not believe her, it is the worst feeling. She came to you because she felt comfortable enough to tell you about it, don‚Äôt say her feelings are not valid. If she‚Äôs asking for help, she needs it. Even tho she did not show symptoms to YOU, you do not see what she hides. I hid eating disorders, self harm, suicide attempts, I hide it all from my parents because most parents react the same - they don‚Äôt believe their child. please support her, please believe her, and please get her the help that she is asking for. Before it is to late for her, and you lose your daughter.

My son is 15. He is not allowed sleepovers, but he always complains. How do I get him to stop?
Coming from a teenager herself, you have to let your child experience life. By not letting him making his own choices he is losing trust in you and making him question any relationship with you he has. Most troubled kids come from a home of strict rules and parents. He will never learn the ins and outs of life, if he‚Äôs locked in his room or chained to a house. My mom attempted to keep me home, and all it did was show me that she has 0 trust In me, and that was a horrible feeling. Don‚Äôt put that pressure on your son, let him be a kid while he can because soon enough his childhood will be ripped from his hands, so let him try and love it.

My concern here is‚ÄîIn places in which women are the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the community, not shaming their bodies and sexualities because of something that a scripture said‚Äîthese places have no raping cases, people don‚Äôt kill each other just for the sake of doing so. etc etc. A society where women are value as equals they have a peaceful outcome. But when it‚Äôs in a society lead by this religion, women are prostitutes, gutted, raped, etc. And evil it‚Äôs just all around. PEOPLE not the ‚Äúdevil‚Äù I hate when people don‚Äôt take responsibilities for their actions and just point fingers at some boogie man‚Ä¶
So what does that tell you about your religion? Your religion provokes bat shit crazy stuff. Not peace, not fairness, not justice. And that‚Äôs not what we want as a community. And I‚Äôm concern about this because I‚Äôm a Christian, and I believe Jesus it‚Äôs a man that‚Äôs there for all men. But is he there for women though? Believe me this is breaking me apart because I admire Jesus wether is religiously or not. But I‚Äôm staring to think we don‚Äôt have the right answers with us.

I think the best thing you can do it‚Äôs to learn not to give a fuck about what others think of you. It‚Äôs okay to be you, just saying. And just get along with people who don‚Äôt think that way‚Ä¶I have the same problem but I‚Äôm very direct now so people stop assuming.

I‚Äôm already Christian‚ÄîI‚Äôm just trying to find out if I should still be Christian. But then I find out that there‚Äôs is societies in which women are the leaders of the community. But there is no sexism, there is no rape, and women are not seem as ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù than men either. Women just happen to have honor in what they do, and are proud of their natural instinct. Which is caring for their families. Your religion has created shame upon this, you think that ‚Äúliberals‚Äù are the ones hurting the gender roles, but isn‚Äôt Christians who transform something wholesome, like caring for their child, as oppression against women? I‚Äôm sorry to bust your bubble‚Äîbut your religion it‚Äôs the one hurting the gender roles in our societies. By shaming women, and silence them and not let them be who they are meant to be. Themselves.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I‚Äôm an Educational Psychologist who also provides counseling. I have had many kids come through my office with serious mental health issues and concerns. As part of a thorough assessment, we provide parents with a series of questionnaires about their child and potential concerns. On many occasions parents may not note any observable signs in there responses. The child then provides their own questionnaires and we can see major discrepancies between what the child is experiencing and what the parents notice. There are many children and adolescents who ‚Äúsuffer in silence‚Äù or experience covert symptoms. By the time the symptoms are severe enough to be noted by teachers and peers it often means that the issues at hand have progressed beyond the adolescent‚Äôs control or ability to cope. I would take‚Ä¶

What made you cut your dad out of your life?
His disloyal behavior towards our ‚Äúonce was‚Äù family. He started cheating in their marriage when I was a kid (I remember meeting the lady when I was about 5 and up). Had no idea of what was going on until my adult years. He‚Äôs never really been a father figure. When I was young, I‚Äôd get scared of sleeping in the dark alone, and I‚Äôd ask him to at least sleep in the bed with me until I fell asleep, to which he angrily said no. He‚Äôs yelled at me and gone off on me when things in the marriage weren‚Äôt going the way he wanted. My poor mother finally caught him in the act when a bunch of deleted phone numbers popped up on the caller ID we had in our house. She also can‚Äôt stand the smell of a certain perfume because she smelled it on him one day and knew it had to be from that other woman. So my dad a‚Ä¶

Why is K-pop so feminine?
I‚Äôve always wondered the same until I saw how crazy girls go over it (when it came to seeing them fawn over the boy bands on social media). There‚Äôs literal pages dedicated to how the boys (out of respect of this post, I‚Äôll dull it down) fondle each other, and kinda pretend as if they‚Äôre dating each other, dance on each other, kiss each other on the cheek, etc, etc. y‚Äôknow, things that would be considered ‚Äúnot straight‚Äù to most western men. There‚Äôs a whole group of people who call Stray kids , G-y kids. In all honesty, I think their managers call the shots and tell them to behave that way for popularity.

What is the scariest thing you have seen or heard at night while sleeping in your bed?
Back in 2017 I was staying with my then bf at the time, and I was snapping out of my sleep.. as I was waking up I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe but my eyes were still closed. So when I opened them I saw a dark figure on top of me, and it looked/felt like it was choking me (I thought it was my ex trying to do something, but no..he was faced away sleeping). So I woke up all the way and was out of breathe, looking around, confused. But at that moment, I realized I needed to escape that toxic relationship and household (we were staying with his racist grandfather who had tons of ptsd from being in war). Definitely an eye opener for me. After I left the next year, I was so at ease‚Ä¶

Wow are you serious? Everyone's symptoms are different. Would you believe your kids if they came to you telling they got molested by a family member or put in a situation similar to it? Probably not. My mother laughed at me when I told her I was depressed at 16, because I hid behind smiles and laughs all the time. Don't be that mom that grows old wondering why her daughter isn't around and doesn't come to her about ANYthing‚Ä¶ listen to your kids woman..

So, I would like to first answer by saying that I doubt you mean to harm your daughter, in fact, maybe it‚Äôs down to a pervasive stigma around mental health. Media tends to show the most extreme example of a mental health condition or alternatively the ‚Äòrise from the ashes‚Äô narrative: look at what they overcame and where they are now! Isn‚Äôt it all so grand that there‚Äôs always a way out, guys! If somebody hasn‚Äôt experienced mental health issues to the extent they filter down into disrupting daily life, then it‚Äôs harder to connect to what the other person is really dealing with due to the very subjective nature of every single mental health issue.

Did you really just say children can‚Äôt have gifts from their family members because their parents owe a debt? Get over yourself, children aren‚Äôt responsible for their parents debt and with everything that was going on for them during the lockdowns with no school or seeing friends you think they don‚Äôt deserve a tv to watch? That‚Äôs so disgusting. ‚ÄúLandlord‚Äù is a business term, and businesses are exactly that- not slave owners. I don‚Äôt agree with how the pandemic hurt any businesses- that included restaurants and salons etc. but to say people‚Äôs kids need to suffer and can‚Äôt even have gifts from relatives is crazy to me. You take it too far.

I think it‚Äôs wrong to assume right away that she‚Äôs a good person to begin with. I do agree cheating is wrong but he‚Äôs already admitted he did the wrong thing he needed a way to proceed to have positive results for his kids. I can honestly say that my marriage was not a happy one and my kids have less stress now after my divorce. I could care less who he‚Äôs with now we made the right decision. Neither one of us cheated to leave for someone else but it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference with how we fought all the time.

My tenant continually submits rent payment on the 5th of the month. The lease does offer a 5 day grace period. What is the best way to handle this situation?
I think if they are paying on the 5th it‚Äôs because you allowed it in the lease and they are probably waiting to get paid. Add a late fee to the next lease after the 1st if you don‚Äôt want to offer a grace period. If it‚Äôs paid and that‚Äôs how you wrote the lease, really what is the problem?

Can narcissistic abuse make you feel physically unwell?
The stress these types of relationships cause can very well manifest physical problems to your health. I spent several years with an ulcerated stomach and frequent breakouts of hives, I suddenly couldn‚Äôt eat certain foods and did not sleep well. After the relationship was over I slowly got better.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
What would you do if she fell and hurt herself and came to you for help? Same thing, take her to a doctor. As a parent of a teenager myself I can tell you that times are definitely hard for them right now in the world, there‚Äôs plenty to feel anxious or depressed about. Mental health is extremely important and you should help her be as healthy as she can be. Symptoms aren‚Äôt always in plain sight, if she‚Äôs coming to you for help, she needs it.

9 months post-breakup of a 3m relationship with a toxic person who claimed I'm his soulmate, but later cheated on me and blamed me, I'm still confused. He's now having longer lasting, happier relationship. How do I stop ruminating and blaming myself?
I think you should find comfort in knowing just because something looks good on the outside doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs actually happier or better. That‚Äôs what they want you to think. Just move on by realizing that you‚Äôre a better person without them and work on making yourself happy before you try to even think about being with someone else. To keep your mind off it keep yourself busy. I used to exercise and watch really long shows with tons of episodes I would look forward to seeing. I picked up a love of creating art again after I had not done it in many years. Spend time with family and friends. It will get better.

I would just continue on what you are doing and removed any connections you may have with him. I would also just be very careful when you are out and be safe. Maybe carry something for protection like pepper spray. Once you show that you really are serious and they cant charm their way into making you do what they want they do sometimes become violent. My ex broke things around the house that were very special to me. They will invade your privacy and show up where you least expect it. I stayed around my friends and family for several months after our breakup and it helps to have someone else around.

I agree, the illusion of my relationship was what I was losing and that upset me because I had put so much work into keeping it going. All of the pain and work I had put in to accommodate him constantly felt like a failure. They are good at making you feel isolated and bring down your self esteem and worth on purpose to make you apprehensive about leaving. Every day I forced myself to write two lists of good things and bad- to show myself nothing was changing and also- that I wasn‚Äôt really losing anything that helped me or my children. My list always always had more negatives than positives and the relationship was also affecting my health. In knew it‚Äôs was important for myself to just get out and get back to being myself again.

So, when the authorities call to take arms to go to war, you will go! First of all, vaccines are not mandatory. And Bible has to say something about it, Revelations 18:23,24 - phamakea will deceive all people. Actually, this is mark of the beast. You are following false prophet not God. Your false prophet is inspired by Satan, not holy spirit. Since you changed your DNA you are not true human and Jesus doesnt recognize you.

Many people outside think that all Arabs i (Palestinians) live on West Bank and Gaza. Two millions live as full citizens of Israel. Many serve in military, police, and in different professions. Some would blame government for own hardships feeling discriminated. I lived in Israel for ten years and I could feel deprived of decent life. However, I could not blame Arabs and Jews who had nice houses and I had to pay high rents. But I blame government which did not provide better living conditions for new immigrants. So, everyone has some reason to feel discriminated and unwanted in Israel.

It has to do with the security of American banking protocols, iirc. Basically, as I understand it, we don't just give out our account numbers because, at least until fairly recently, there wasn't any way to prevent unauthorized transfers because the banks didn't want to implement the extra security measures that the rest of the world has had forever, and now we still don't do it because we're not used to it.

A transgender lesbian is a trans woman (that is, someone whose original birth certificate was marked ‚Äúmale‚Äù, but is actually a woman) who loves and is attracted to women.
Similarly, gay trans men also exist (I'm one of them! Hi!), as do straight trans people (meaning, trans women who are attracted to men and trans men who are attracted to women), and even bisexual and asexual trans people. The gender that you are isn't inherently related to the gender or genders that you're attracted to, and every orientation that exists among cisgender people, also exists among transgender people.

I believe it. First of all, when my son first got glasses, he was only about four years old, but he had already begun to compensate for his poor vision, and his glasses gave him headaches, so he didn't want to wear them, and when I mentioned this to his opthalmologist, he warned me that, if he didn't wear them, then he could develop exactly the problem the poster described.
Secondly, both my father and my brother have lazy eye. Now, the standard treatment for that is to strengthen the weaker eye by putting a patch over the stronger one, forcing the weaker one to take over. If this process isn't done as close to 24/7 as possible, before about the age of 9, then the brain will learn to simply shut out the dissonant input from the weaker eye, causing irreversible, uncorrectable blindness in that eye. Unfortunately, my grandparents weren't consistent about making my dad wear his patch, and my parents weren't consistent about making my brother wear his, and now they're both blind in the one eye, and their descriptions of what they ‚Äúsee‚Äù out of their bad eyes sounds very much like what the poster said their vision is like.

The cost varies by state, and iirc in most states you can apply to waive at least some of it if you're very low-income. But yeah, average is probably around $500 in court fees, notary fees, fees to have the FBI run your fingerprints (as my state requires), plus about $25-$150 for new ID documents, depending on whether you need a passport or not.
I've read that part of the reason it's so difficult here is because the earliest versions of the laws establishing the process for legally changing one's name were put on the books in the aftermath of our Civil War, and a sizeable contingent of state legislators wanted to make it harder for former slaves to leave their pasts behind.

At one point, I had so much testosterone in my system that it was an actual medical concern, and I never committed any violent crimes during that time. It's not testosterone, it's the combination of a culture that tells men that violence is how you assert your masculinity when you feel insulted or aggrieved, and laws that allow pretty much anyone to buy any of a very wide variety of firearms, firearm accessories, and ammunition, in any quantity they like, with very few questions asked.

I can absolutely assure you that plenty of young people out there still identify as cisgender and gay (and plenty also identify as both transgender and gay, for that matter). Also, hormone therapy doesn't work that way. Cisgender men don't want their bodies to be more feminine, and cisgender women don't want their bodies to be more masculine ‚Äî and if you think that you would find the process of your body becoming more like that of the opposite sex ‚Äúaddictive,‚Äù then, friend, I've got some news for you that you might not want to hear.

The point is that if you are talking about menstruation and the needs of the people whose bodies do it ‚Äî which, to be very clear, is the only context in which the term ‚Äúpeople who menstruate‚Äù should be used ‚Äî then it's not necessary to include post-menopausal cis women, cis women who have had hysterectomies and/or oophorectomies, cis women who were born without functioning ovaries and/or uteri, or trans women. Furthermore, there are people who menstruate who are not women, but are not transgender: a nine year old cisgender girl may menstruate, but she is not yet a woman.
So although you *could* say ‚Äúwomen and girls who menstruate‚Äù in that context if you didn't care about including those trans men and nonbinary people who menstruate, it would be incorrect to say just ‚Äúwomen.‚Äù And at that point, ‚Äúpeople who menstruate‚Äù is a shorter and simpler phrase.

And the other benefit of ‚Äúpeople who menstruate‚Äù and similar language is that it also excludes cis women who don't. Post-menopausal? You're not a person who menstruates, you don't need to worry about whatever is being discussed. If there's a discussion about the symptoms of uterine cancer that people with uteruses need to be aware of, and you're a cis woman who's had a hysterectomy, then you know you aren't the target audience.

Do you have a source for this? I think that dysphoria can be more subtle for same-gender attracted and/or gender nonconforming trans people because of heteronormative pressures in society ‚Äî that is, if a person who was assigned female at birth is attracted to men and feels most comfortable expressing themselves in feminine-coded ways, or a person who was assigned male at birth is attracted to women and feels most comfortable expressing themselves in masculine-coded ways, then that's seen by society as ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and society doesn't punish them for it ‚Äî and because of that, it can take much longer for that variety of trans person to pinpoint what, exactly, is causing their dysphoric feelings, but those feelings didn't necessarily actually start any later in life.
Admittedly, *my* only source for this belief is my own personal experience as a fairly feminine gay trans man who definitely experienced gender dysphoria starting from the age of four, but didn't figure out that that's what it was until I was nearly 30.

So I think that, because trans men are striving to be seen as members of a higher-status group (i.e. men), that doesn't seem like nearly as much as of a violation of today's generally accepted social norms as trans women do by willingly seeking to leave a higher-status group and join a lower-status one, nor do they activate people's anxieties about the possibility that they might *unwillingly* lose status quite so acutely.

My personal theory is that it has to do with socioeconomic mobility. Hear me out: back in Shakespeare's day, there was very little mobility between the classes. You were born to the station you were born to, and that's where you stayed. It was exceptionally rare to be born into the aristocracy, but die as a pauper, and rising to a higher class status was nearly as rare, and generally considered an affront to society to even try.

As others have said, your trans friend was never a girl, they only looked like one (some trans people do use the ‚ÄúI was born an X, but now I'm a Y,‚Äù terminology, but that's pretty uncommon nowadays, especially among younger trans folks, so it's safer to assume that a given trans person prefers to be thought of as always having been the gender they say they are). So, you didn't have a crush on your friend ‚Äúwhen they were a girl,‚Äù you had a crush on a boy or nonbinary person who you mistook for a girl. Secondly, since I assume you're a cis boy or a young cis man, I'll give you a piece of advice that will serve you well going forward: unless they ask specifically, very few women (or anyone who's ever been treated as a woman), care about what any particular man does or doesn't find attractive,‚Ä¶

Sounds like me when I was in high school. The thing about it is, cisgender people really don't question their gender much. It's easy for them: if a cis person questions their gender at all, they're usually able to conclude, within a matter of days at most, that they are indeed the gender that they were assigned at birth. So if this has been a consistent theme throughout your life, then you probably are a trans boy.
That said, you don't get a prize for making a decision on it as fast as you possibly can, and exploring your gender can be quite enjoyable‚Äîas you discovered yourself when you got that haircut. So my advice is to play with your gender: have a trusted friend call you by a new name and/or pronouns, and see how that feels. Buy or borrow a chest binder (I, for one, like the brand GC2B) and see how it makes you feel to see yourself in the mirror with a flat chest. Be experimental, find what feels right and keep doing that, and if anything doesn't feel right, stop doing it.
Good luck!

Can a 10-year-old girl date a 14-year-old boy?
no, please do not do that or if you are the parent do not allow that. Teenagers, especially those in 8th grade and high school are much more sexually advanced than those in the grade lower. The 14 year old is going to want more than the 10 year old is ready for (regardless of if they think they are ready i promise you they are not.) It is aweful for your mental health and physical health to advance too quickly with sexual activities.

Do all teenage boys want children?
No, not all. Some may, but even then it does not make sense to have them until you are financially stable with a spouse. It is detrimental to a child to grow up with one parent. Short answer not all teenage boys want children, and some do. Both are completely normal.

Should I allow my 13-year-old daughter to send her boyfriend pictures?
Depends? Pictures of her outfits, her face, or nudes? If it‚Äôs any of the first 2 of course it‚Äôs completely fine. If you mean the third one no absolutely not it‚Äôs a crime and both her and her boyfriend could be in deep shit. Even if the police aren‚Äôt involved what if her boyfriend sends it to people or shows his friends? Think about the effect that will have on your daughter. So short answer As long as she isn‚Äôt sending nudes yes, let her. If she is sending nudes no do not let her.

I have an IQ of 500. What should I do?
Scores and items on an IQ test are adjusted in such a way that each year the average stays the same, people like Einstein are the outliers, but its accuracy depletes the further a score deviates from the median that the it always keeps up with smarter generationsmedian. So a score of 500 theoretically possible using an IQ test from decades ago. But I would recommend using a real proven IQ test.

Why do some people think they can keep lying, and that others will always believe them?
People lie as an a result of not being caught lying or not being punished, can result in a Learnt behavior for their own ‚Äúsafety"" it's like an escape goat. scapegoat. Substance abuse and lying has a correlation as well because they lie to protect themselves from judgement because it is a safety net if they're caught up in corner. Alcoholics might lie to others and themselves just to justify their behaviors, and a behavior is Learnt when an a positive outcome is reached and they are rewarded if they lie and escape the situation with no judgement they'll keep using the same mechanism over and over. A form of resolving Cognitive dissonance.dissonance and operant conditioning.

Everyone gets lonely at times, the narcissistic tendency of a psychopath does allow them to be happy on their own but the narcissistic tendency also needs gratification or satisfaction, it's a need to be regarded by others as the superior, better and stronger person. This is all in the subconscious even if they deny such accusations. Their IDs needs to be satisfied according to the pleasure principle.

Why do teenagers on Reddit believe that children under 13 are inferior?
It stems from parenting, we see our parents as the ultimate heroes just because of the wisdom they have gathered through the years just being alive for so long. Teenagers feel like they're already at that stage of adulthood even though it's a while to go, when rebellious behavior start, some kids feel like they're independent of their parents when they receive a car on their 16th birthday perhaps Or the parents are verbally or physically abusive and the way they blow of some steam is through attacking others that are ‚Äúweaker"" in their eyes, online or in person. It's easy to hide behind a screen and bully others, unfortunately.

Why do you prefer taking a chance? It's inconvenient for you?
I can't believe you had to ask this on Quora instead of taking the kid straight to a therapist. You not believing her shouldn't have anything to do with it.
My father ignored my cries for a therapist for years and when I had finally got the means to afford one, I discovered I had a whole bunch of issues that could have been fixed much sooner.
Use common sense.

Except he was never going to go along with Zeke's plan to begin with.
That was a ruse, to save the Eldia, so he never planned to hurt a single Eldian living in Paradis.

Your daughter doesn‚Äôt think she has mental health issues ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù, she‚Äôs most likely known for a while and finally she found ghe courage she needed to tell you. Mental disorders are more common than you think, there‚Äôs a lot of stigma around them and they‚Äôre highly misunderstood. Some symptoms are easy to miss or might seem like they‚Äôre not a big deal, while they‚Äôre actually causing a lot of pain in the inside. She also might have masked or maybe she‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-functioning‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt have facts and reasons to not trust her, you should really listen to her with a open heart. If you just say that you think she‚Äôs lying your daughter is probably scared of showing symptoms around you and opening up to you, and this is absolutely not an attack to your parenting, being a mother is not easy‚Ä¶

There are different types of attraction: ‚Ä¢ Sexual attraction (i want to have s3x with them) ‚Ä¢ Romantic attraction (i want to date them) ‚Ä¢ Aesthetic attraction (they‚Äôre good-looking, i appreciate their beauty) ‚Ä¢ Platonic Attraction (i want to be their friend) ‚Ä¢ Sensual attraction (i want to cuddle with them) The main ones are the first and the second. One thing that many people don‚Äôt tell you is that they don‚Äôt always match. For example you might want to date women, men and enby, but would only want to have s3x with men. That‚Äôs possible. Knowing this we can say that basing your choice of label on a single question like: ‚Äúwould you ever have s3x with the same gender‚Äù is incorrect. You can also choose to not have a label and say that you‚Äôre queer (which means you‚Äôre not cishet) or simply that you d‚Ä¶

Hey! Talking about sexuality, I feel the same as you, I‚Äôm homosexual and biromantic, you know how you feel about s3x with women and men, but what about dating them? Would you imagine yourself dating a man? What about a woman?
I also recently found this Google Docs and I know it helped some people understand better their sexuality, so here it is: Copy of Am I a Lesbian? Masterdoc - üüßSourceful

My employer wants to switch me from hourly to salary. I'll work the same hours, and without overtime, will lose 25% of my pay, while being expected to work upwards to 70 hours per week in high season. Is this legal?
You will have to check labour regulations in your jurisdiction. If they are expecting you to do the same job, same number of hours, for less pay, that is something you will have to discuss with them & you willl have to make a decision about whether you are okay with that. What the can‚Äôt do, is pay you less than minimum wage per hour worked (at least in my jurisdiction) That all said, not just looking at the wage, are there other benefits to working salary? Paid time off? Better benefits? Other perks? All things that need to be considered

My mother was set to inherit some property but she died before she could collect. After she died her siblings divided the property. As her son, am I entitled to anything? Or is it too late?
As others have said, it depends on how the will is drawn up. My grandma‚Äôs will said her estate was to be divide among her children/grandchildren who outlived her by 30 days. Before 30 days, it would have been divided as if that child/grandchild was no longer living. After 30 days, it would go to their heirs estate, if they passed before it was executed.

Will the Demo-Nazis (aka Democrats) be able to force Chick-fil-A to stay open on Sunday? If so, what else can the Nazis make us do?
Please understand the terms you are so quick to throw around. Nazi‚Äôs were fascist. Fascism is a far right-wing political ideology which would be closer to Republican views. I‚Äôm not suggesting republicans are fascist. There is clearly a wide range of views that fall under right wing or republican politics, just as there is a wide range of views that would fall under left-wing or democratic politics in a two-party political system like that in the US. Democrats cannot be both communist & fascist (Nazi) like uneducated folks seem to think. Amazing though, despite being on the extreme ends of the spectrum, they are rely on control, silencing critics & rejecting the rule of law. Hmmmmmm, wonder who else does that?

Americans and Canadians look different. Americans have pale skin and light eyes, and Canadians have dark skin/eyes. Have you noticed?
Well, that‚Äôs a confusing observation. As a blue-eyed, blonde, fair skinned Canadian, I‚Äôm wondering if the US will just give me citizenship based on that? Is there a special department to streamline that process? Are you a troll or blind? Really the only options, and blind people are smarter than to make that generalization, so I guess that really just leaves one option. As you know, both countries have citizens of every skin tone & eye colour.

What would you do if your loved ones was suffering from dementia would you try to take care of that person or try to put the person in a nursing home?
Sadly, I know first hand what I would do. I would take care of that person as long as it was feasible. A dementia diagnosis doesn't change a person overnight. However, there often comes a point where it is not safe for you or them to continue looking after them. At that point, a home may be the only option. That is of course assuming the family can afford it.

The CPS wants to put my seven-year-old on Ritalin. I said I‚Äôm against it and she said she will just put an order to the judge. What can I do to prevent this?
They can‚Äôt force you. A judge can not just order it as they are not a medical doctor & unable to write prescriptions. That said, if a medical doctor believes it is in the best interest of your child and that your choice to not medicate is causing harm to your son, they may be able support the application of CPS. This would be extremely unusual. Your question however, makes me believe you have not done your research about medication options and the benefits & disadvantages that go along with them. Ritalin, although still available, is one of many medications used to treat diagnosed ADHD. There are stimulants as well as non-stimulant options. Each come with their own pros & cons.

He's never been accused of being a paedophile or having sex with an underage girl, that's just an ignorant thing people say to insult him. Whilst I think he's a total buffoon, the facts remain that firstly the girl was over the age of consent, he did not sleep with an underage girl on any occasion. Secondly, it has been proven that there is a good chance she made it up. She herself has alluded to this. Whether that's the case or not I wouldn't like to speculate, but she agreed to a payment from him because she couldn't produce any evidence and the copy of the photo she shared with the world was photoshopped. It has also been made known that the amount he paid her was not even a fraction of the amount the tabloids have claimed. I'm not defending him but I don't understand why people think that they can spread misinformation about one person in order to ""defend"" another. it makes it look as if you actually have nothing good to say about the person you're trying to support. You also embarrass yourself by saying stuff that's not even true. He's a prat, but he's not a paedophile.

Why is everyone assuming the child stole? It doesn't say that. The other child could have given it to them and then changed their mind. Clearly the child has come home with this toy, so first the parent needs to find out if he had permission to take it.
If not then immediately return it, whether it's asked for or not. Buying a replacement would only be necessary if my child had broke it. If that was the case then I would buy a replacement but make a deduction from the child's pocket money or reduce regular treats for a reasonable period (age and understanding appropriate) to go towards paying for the replacement.
If it was given to my child and then the other kid wants it back now, then that's a different issue. On the whole I would probably say to give it back cos it saves any falling out between the kids (and adults). But children should still be taught that you can't gift something and then take it back. So, if I was financially able to, I would possibly purchase a replacement for my own child because they've been affected by another child not being taught/understanding this lesson.
However, there is also the point that it's not really polite to visit someone's home and leave with their possessions. So if, for instance, my child asked for it and the other child agreed, then I would be telling my child that they should not have asked to have someone else's toy. In that case I would not be buying a new one for my child at this point because then they will think they can have everything they ask for. I may keep it in mind for a future treat for good behaviour, or birthday/Christmas gift though.
BUT I wouldn't accept ""refusal"" from my child to give it back - they should do as I've asked. I will also not make the promise of buying a new toy just to get them to obey my instructions. But we all know that young children/toddlers don't always do as they're asked immediately. That doesn't mean that they should get their own way, it just means that as parents we need to be more patient and understanding of the fact that they are learning all these life lessons and trying to process them alongside their own feelings - ""I want""! Once an explanation has been given, if the child still refuses to cooperate, then the parent may need to simply take the toy (and ride out a tantrum), or distract them with something else.
Because we don't know the age of the children and the circumstances of how the one child came to be taking the toy home, this is not a straightforward answer. Really the parent should have dealt with it the moment that the kid brought this new toy home. By finding out the circumstances straight away and discussing it with the other parents then future issues could be avoided.

Because the green isn‚Äôt in the centre of the others to cause the reflection that was demonstrated in the diagram someone has drawn for you above. There is a faint star visible in the distance of one of the other photos, not green and nothing to do with the green light photo. Even you acknowledge that these lights weren‚Äôt visible except in the photo. If you do think they are some kind of other being, what are you suggesting? UFOs? They surely wouldn‚Äôt just be visible in a photo and not in person? Ghosts? They are known to possibly be captured on camera even if not visible to the naked eye, but surely wouldn‚Äôt look like a possible UFO? Or are we talking a ghost UFO? I‚Äôm not trying to ridicule any third worldly suggestions, but I do think that in this case the simplest explanation is the most logical. The camera lens explanation is well known and the formation exactly replicates a reflection of the visible lights in your caravan. It may be lots of fun to look for another, more exciting, explanation, but the truth is simple science!

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Never, ever disbelieve someone who says they have a mental health problem. Mental health is a very complex area and you are not qualified to know all the ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù. I get the impression that you would expect her to show the stereotypical symptoms of mental illnesses like schizophrenia or bipolar. There are numerous mental health conditions which have many different symptoms. How do you know that she is not feeling suicidal and hiding that from you? How would you feel if you refused her help and she did something terrible? The fact that she has told you she wants to talk to someone shows she has things inside her that she is desperate to get out. Why would you withhold that help from her? On the flip side, lets say you are right and she really doesn‚Äôt have any type of mental health problem? W‚Ä¶

I apologise if I come across as critical towards you and I didn‚Äôt say that your post was meant for anyone ‚Äúto take sides‚Äù, I have no idea why you would think that, sorry!

Of course if it had spilled into other answers then it would have gotten tedious and off-topic and perhaps you prevented that, but perhaps it was never going to happen. I don‚Äôt think it would have because I honestly don‚Äôt think they were arguing in a childish or disrespectful manner and think they both took into account the others points.

Maybe this is an example of how things get lost in translation in text because I didn‚Äôt read anything nearly as petty as what you seem to have. I read a mature discussion of a point, with no rudeness or pettiness. At the end of it I could see both points and didn‚Äôt feel any pressure to take a side because they had not put them across that way. I come on Quora sometimes for answers, sometimes for reasonable discussions of valid points. That‚Äôs what they had. Your comment seems to be a severe overreaction or misinterpretation of what is written. If you can‚Äôt handle a forum where people don‚Äôt agree all the time then you probably shouldn‚Äôt come on here, I‚Äôm not even sure what to suggest for you because lalaland is the only place I know of such perfect unity.

All of my life I‚Äôve been asked if I am Asian. I do have Asian features. I never knew of any Asian ancestors and a DNA test confirms that I am of European descent. How can that be?
Hi! You likely have some Indigenous heritage: either Eastern European or Native American, but since most tribes refuse to give DNA data, these tests can't really tell you the results. It's one reason why I would never pay for one (aside from the selling of your biological data to fascist organizations and also the fact that as a mixed native I think blood quantum is just all around bad) I grew up having racial slurs uelled at me while being bullied, asked by Asians if I was mixed Asian (usually Chinese or Indian which don't even look similar to each other haha but I‚Äôve also been assumed Japanese or Korean). Adter escaping a 31 year long abuse situation, my cousins let me know I‚Äôm native on my mom‚Äôs side. She hid it from me, yaaaaaay/sarcasm I'm trying to reconnect to my heritage and it's so f‚Ä¶

How would you react if a member of BTS confessed their feelings to you in person? How would you react if they did it over video chat or a phone call?
‚ÄúHow did you get my number? We‚Äôve never met. I‚Äôm calling the cops"".

How do you not know??? Lmao EASY
My mother hid it in shame from us my entire life. She was also abusive so we were isolated from most family and the family we did speak to were hush about it because of having to live through an era of Residential school years past.
I only learned after I escaped and my cousin messaged me about it. A lot of stuff started fitting together. Like being BROWN as a kid (later became super pale from autoimmune melanin depletion and sun allergy), being asked if I was Asian repeatedly, and mother chopping off my hair after braiding it because a neighbour told her I looked like Pocahontas and her hiding the braid in a pouch in the back of the cupboard for years and years (I often found her crying over it at night). I was forced to wear my hair very short even in my adulthood. I remember eating wild game with my cousins as a kid. I remember the moccasins and rabbit skin mittens we had when I was younger. As a teen we went to see the totem poles where my mother grew up and she got emotional and then irrationally angry about everything. The medicine pouches my cousins always had. The weird bigotry and hatred of people on the Rez that my mother was so adamant about. And so much more.
I have met so many other Canadian Millennials like me who only found out in adulthood. Because of the murder schools, societal stigma, generational trauma‚Ä¶. There's a lot of reasons why.
My issue now is finding resistance as I try and connect to my heritage. I‚Äôm seen as a ‚Äúpretendian‚Äù because I didn't grow up knowing; an interloper. Doesn't help that I live in a very large city and the natives here aren't very connected to their heritage much, either.
(If you must know, my grandmother was French and M√©tis and my grandfather was mostly Blackfoot with a bit of M√©tis)

He is feminine in the way men are seen socially, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that in any way. It doesn't make him less of a man ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Femininity doesn't equate to WOMAN.
I‚Äôd also like to say he also has masculine traits as well. As Taemin said, he‚Äôs androgynous. Androgyny in fashion, performance, personality etc doesn't necessarily mean his gender. As far as we know he is a man. (Btw chromosomes don't equate to gender, either. Sometimes it doesn't affect biological sex much either! There is so much more to chromosomes and biological sex than what you were taught in high school. Take it from an intersex individual üòâ)

I was jokingly saying I was getting my gears worked up but realized that's not what you were saying.
And it's not so much ‚Äúdiagnosing‚Äù as seeing that most of his behaviours match those of us on the spectrum and it's kind of empowering to feel that someone like a VTS member who we love and adore could possibly share that similarity with us.
Most celebrities in the West have a hard time with saying they're on the spectrum because of public stigma; no one in Korea is going to say it, unless they have a need to or need specific supports. I was actually flabbergasted that Yoongi said he had ADHD but I think that because of the prevalence of it on the internet and media and it being seen as a more ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù neuropsychiatric disorder that it's probably not as stigmatized (until a patient needs support, ofc, because it's even like that in the West üôÉ)
But honestly there is no current biomarker test for autism, it's a diagnosis through behavioural analysis. And so far, Joon fits the bill to a T (so do Yoongi and JK).
I‚Äôd also like to point out that ND people have a harder time connecting in most capacities to allistic and NT people so it's not too out there to say that more than one member would be ND in that way.

At first my autistic ass was like ‚Äúshould‚Ä¶‚Ä¶should I be offended?‚Äù Then realized you were saying that not as an insult but because of what that account had written. I was also annoyed you added extra insult to injury by using the most autistic human known to man‚Äôs image here (No, it's not confirmed but most autistic who are ARMY will tell you that Joon is most DEFINITELY on the spectrum, and probably not the only one in that group lmao)

I think Yoongi wants fame, craves fame, loves fame but hates that he wants and likes those things, esp growing up poor and disillusioned with money and power. He has a good head on his shoulders but usually with that comes a whopping dose of self awareness and knowledge of how the world turns. And that can suck the big, hairy toe tbh.
Joon on the other hand‚Ä¶ I think he likes the attention because he fills like he's fitting in during those times but man is that guy just‚Ä¶ going through it.
Fame is difficult. It ruins most who have it.

I thought I was gonna have to be unpopular and say that if you like them you're a fan whether or not you know everything but actually this tracks haha
I‚Äôve had people tell me I can't be a ‚Äútrue fan‚Äù of something if ai don't remember things or know xyz of whatever in the fandom and that's bung, honestly (this happens at anime cons a lot ü´†)
But fans who have been around a long time and demean members or stan ot9 after everything aren't fans, or at least, they aren't GOOD fans, y‚Äôknow?
I don't know everything about SKZ and in fact, because of my partial face blindness, I often have issues telling Lee Know and I.N apart üòÖ And I‚Äôve only managed to memorize all their names within the last year.

What‚Äôs the most impressive thing your parent(s) have done?
My father barely graduated high school and got a job as a deck hand on cargo ships. Rose through the ranks and eventually became VP of political relations at said company, as well as the executive manager of health and safety operations.
He had to sacrifice the love of his family for it, though, so F-, would not recommend

I'm in Canada and it's just that ‚Ä¶I relate to him. It's thought he‚Äôs queer and whether or not that is even true, he just gives off queer energy. He‚Äôs neurodivergent: confirmed ADHD and clinical depression and I highly suspect ASD (a couple other members I do, too, one of them I'M absolutely certain about), tsundere (though it was more so in the past. He‚Äôs more of a softy outside and inside now. He can bite, but so do most people. I think maybe I'd call him a ‚Äúprotective family member‚Äù) , hates forced gender norms, promotes mental health issues and services and speaks his mind quite honestly.
As a millenial who grew through adulthood with a few Gen Z‚Äôs by his side every day, he‚Äôs in between both worlds. And idk that's just kinda endearing

He‚Äôs apparently fiercely familial and filial. I attended a college with his cousin (who since returned to SK for military duty and I had life hit me with a truck so we‚Äôve lost contact) who said he while he wasn't close to Yoongi cause Yoongi was more content to sit alone at family gatherings, he always attended with his parents when he could. He apparently got along better with his adult family than his cousins similar in age growing up and was intimidating to approach with his permanent rbf üòÇüòÖ
But he was always super polite and formal and followed his parents everywhere.
His cousin said he‚Äôs seen him smile more through memes at that time (2018/19) than he ever did in real life. I remember joking with my friend like ‚Äúwhy didn't you go into acting/singing/trying for trainee‚Äù and he was just like ‚Äúlike most people, I am nowhere near as beautiful as BTS and my cousin was always the most pretty, and visuals are the first thing they go for.‚Äù My friend also hated idol music and only really listened to Western hiphop, much like how Yoongi started ,üòÇ

I think they‚Äôve all mostly had minimal cosmetic work done, but mostly fillers, hairline extensions, peels etc etc
Joon had work on his nose, even more recent than his septum fix, his bridge turns down and under now, less of the upturned ‚Äúpug‚Äù (yeah, i hate this description too but I can't think of any other word) button. Not a drastic change, but its noticeable. There's also something going on with his lips but I can't quite figure it out. Its kinda like the top lip was thinned and it sticks out a bit more but when he tilts his face up you can still see majority of the fullness.
I actually think Tae and Jin have had the least bit done, if any at all, at least not surgically.
Doesn't matter. A tattoo is a cosmetic operation ffs. If thry like it, let them! It doesn't mean they're not attractive. I don't understand why being a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù beauty is seen as better? If you find someone attractive, then that means they're attractive!

Overexposure has gotten me too üòÖ I actually find myself going back to their older footage (by older I mean pre-US takeover) cause even though it's still their BTS personas, it's way less obviously scripted and they don't look like I need to tell them to blink if they need an out.
I'm really enjoying their solo stuffs, I really think they‚Äôre coming into their own when allowed to create on their own (esp Yoongi!). Some if their best stuff in years are their current solo careers! Sad that Jin had to go do his mandatory military instead of a full album.
But, while I‚Äôm enjoying the solo stuff, I‚Äôm only paying cursory attention to everything else Huge wants me to obsessively ogle (I did watch the 2 Disney+ specials for J-Hope and Suga, though. They were fun).
I still consider myself ARMY and a big fan ‚Ä¶ BTS got me through two of the hardest periods of my life (last few years before escaping a lifelong abuse situation and Pandemic lockdown while my health went flying downhill because of Long Covid) and I‚Äôll always be incredibly thankful for the smiles they provided me. I know everyone says it, but I probably wouldn't be here without them.

I think most republicans don't think rampant crime, state of emergency crisis level homelessness, extreme income inequality, anti business and small business laws & policies (Cali earns an F), extreme regulation, and most Uber liberal policies are great ideas to run on. If Dems enjoy all that, then keep on voting for the same thing. Most libertarian republicans are leaving the state in droves, which helps strengthen the Dem stronghold

I would dump this guy too. I broke up with my husband for 3 months when he was gun shy because of a previous divorce. I had been dating him for about 3.5 years by then and I was tired of being strung along. If you don‚Äôt know after three years someone is the right one, then move on. We ended up talking after 3 months and he was ready to see me again. He knew he wanted to see me and did not string me along anymore. We got married 6 months later and have been married 28.5 years now. If he had said ‚Äú‚Äúwe will see as time goes on,‚Äù then I would have walked. I don‚Äôt understand people who sit around hoping forever and then 10 years of their life is gone when they could have found someone else that truly loves them.

Same ,I became a fan during the WINGS era. But now I have matured a lot. I still love them and consider myself as an ARMY even today. But I watch their songs and that's it. I don't follow up with their daily lives. I was suffering from depression and BTS were like my medication. I feel sad cuz they have changed the concept into a westernised one(no hate,like they are the biggest boy group). The old songs were filled with lyrics that everyone could relate.

Is it bad to be happy about seeing someone struggling because of these times since they made me mad and was mistreating me?
Nope,absolutely not. I can understand how you feel cuz I'm in a similar situation. It's fair to see how people get karma back when they mistreated you. Don't feel sorry,because did they ever pity you when they were hurting your feelings?

I want to punish myself for all my past bad behavior towards the most loved person of my life. Should I just spoil my life and all happiness so that I can feel the same pain?
Nope,you shouldn't. If you really feel sorry and guilty of your past behaviour, this is the time for you to correct those mistakes. You have realized the mistakes, so you should make up to them. Try your best and never give up. Spoiling your life will make it more harder for them. It's never too late. Start by small things to gain their trust. For example your daily routine. If you feel like there are some things that needs to be fixed,go ahead. It will take time,but it's okay. Trust and believe in yourself.

As someone who's suffering from severe depression for years, I can tell you it's not easy. You have to battle with yourself to live. It's so painful which might lead to suicide. With depression you feel tired and restless. That's why people just stay in their room.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Just because someone doesn't show anything doesn't mean they're completely fine and happy. In order to hide it they wear a fake face In front of everyone and pretends to be okay. I had a friend and she was happy always. Gave good advices to everyone and was strong. But later on we found she's suffering from severe depression to the point she tried to kill herself. Her parents didn't believe at first at it got worse. Then she went to a counsellor then psychiatrist. So if she needs help you should help her

My husband and I both had the flu at the same time shortly after marriage.
I was standing in the kitchen, trying to get some water down, when I coughed and lost control of my bowels. If you‚Äôve ever had the flu, you likely had severe diarrhea and I‚Äôm sure someone may sympathize with me.
The best part, however, was when my husband released realized what I had done and began laughing. Which triggered his own loss of bowel control.
So while sick with the flu, we both shit our pants in front of each other within seconds.

I'm leaving my wife for another woman. She doesn't know about the cheating and I want the marriage to end on good terms because I don't want any hardships for my kids. How should I approach the subject with her?
Listen, if you are ready to leave. Please leave. Going to counseling only prolongs the inevitable. Sit her down and talk to her and tell her how you have been feeling and for how long. Be supportive. I wish my husband had been honest with me. He had so many affairs, I lost count. Don‚Äôt make it about the other woman. It is about you and your wife. Is there a lack of connection? Then say it. Don‚Äôt belittle her or yourself. I respect someone who finally comes to their sense and tells the truth. It‚Äôs difficult to face our demons. Breaking up is difficult as well. Sometimes it feels easier just to stay in it and just do what you have been doing. To be honest, she probably already feels this coming along. I‚Äôm thinking she probably won‚Äôt be surprised.

I am cheating on my spouse and don't want to stop. What should I do?
My spouse cheated on me. He never admitted to it. I eventually left. But now I actually understand it. I‚Äôm not scorned. I‚Äôm empathetic. In life, we grow at different rates and sometimes we marry the wrong person. Take your time. Sit down with your spouse. Talk about your relationship with your spouse and Wht your expectations are. Do not bring up your other relationship. Be honest about what is missing. Don‚Äôt make it about the other person. If you have children be agreeable to raise them together. I know this sounds crazy but I believe it can work. If my husband had told me these things, it would have hurt, but I probably would have stayed in the house, raised our son together, and had a separate life. Encourage your spouse to find someone once he/she is open. Be supportive. I don‚Äôt blame you‚Ä¶

Reading this inspired me. I am in the middle of a divorce. I met someone over a year ago a few months after I asked my husband for a separation. I wanted nothing to do with anyone. My husband had been mentally and emotionally abusive and cheated on me for over nine years of our almost 10 year marriage.
In a public event with over 10,000 people, my TF and I saw each other in the crowd. But w EBT oh never thought we would see one another again. Minutes later we were in another area and ended exchanging information.
At first I was attracted to him, but it felt as though we had known one another before. To make a long story short. He is married. He initially told me he had a family but I didn‚Äôt read between the lines. Maybe I didn‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt know. But we have fallen in love and can not imaging not being in one another‚Äôs lives.
We make one another better. We compliment one another. I am not trying to rush things. I do not give ultimatums. I know everything will work out the way it‚Äôs supposed to. Reading your story I spires me and gives me hope.
I never knew love could be felt on this level. If everyone in the world experienced this type of love, imagine how wonderful this world would be.
Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing your story.

It may be nothing. However, it may be something. Taking your child to a therapist can only help them and make them better. Just make sure you research the therapist and they are a hood match for your child. Therapy is healthy even for people who think everything in life is ‚Äúok‚Äù. Good luck. You‚Äôre one step in the right direction because you love your child and are willing to get the help needed of necessary!

I respect your transparency. To find someone we love and have commonality is a blessing.

How can I ever get over being cheated on and broken up?
My husband cheated on me. I stayed. I wanted to fight for my marriage but eventually, I got tired of working at it and decided it was over. Only then did he process his love and say he wanted to work on us. By that time, it was too late. I was tired and done.
Cheating is sign you are not with the right person. So instead of cheating, there should be a conversation of what is lacking in the relationship to see if it‚Äôs something that can be worked on or if the relationship is dead. It‚Äôs ok to admit it‚Äôs not working. People are afraid to be transparent. When we are transparent, we reap the benefits and are able to find what‚Äôs absolutely best for us.

Yes, grammatical errors are annoying but not enough to delete you. However, that is my opinion. You may not be good for her, but you are perfect for someone else. Have enough love for yourself to know this!!! Life is too short to waste on people who really at the end of the day do NOT smarter. üôÇ

This is utter rubbish. Firstly, not all twin flames have suffered trauma. Secondly, each individual is different. NPD is not something that is ever prominent in twin flames. This is clearly just one persons experience and very unlikely what they were experiencing was the twin flame connection. Many people get it wrong.

When I split up with my narc ex, we were still living together in a house we jointly owned. We also had a lodger. One day, he decided he was going to try to wind me up and left an unopened pack of condoms on the kitchen counter for me to find, thinking I‚Äôd freak out and get all panicked thinking he was sleeping with someone else. I actually wasn‚Äôt bothered, I already hated him by this point. So, I turned the tables! I opened the pack and took one out and put it in my purse. I then went out, met up with my brother, one of his friends was visiting who I hadn‚Äôt seen in years, so there were a big crowd of people out that night. We all went back to someone‚Äôs house. I ignored my phone, but when I did look at it, I had about 50 missed calls from the ex narc, a load of missed calls from my lodger. Texts from him telling me to get home and demanding to know who I was sleeping with and that he was going to go after them. Loads of texts from the lodger saying she was scared as he was completely freaking out. I just laughed, went back to the conversation I was having.
I got home at about 2am. He was sat on the bed waiting for me, crying and begging me to take him back. I just looked at him calmly, said ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù and grabbed some bedding to go and sleep on the sofa bed downstairs.
Narc‚Äôs want a reaction. They feed off of it, so don‚Äôt give it to them and that‚Äôs how they then panic!! They can‚Äôt stand to lose control!!

The view psychologists have on BPD is quite alarming and also quite outdated. I had a long chat with a specialist while looking for more updated treatment options and he suggested Neurofeedback as an option. I actually found that a lot of therapists, like many doctors of other illnesses, treat the symptoms and not the route of it. So much more research needs to be done around the route cause and how to treat it with cluster b disorders. However, things like DPT can help and be very effective (even though that is symptom based treatment as well). There are workbooks you can get on Amazon that are supposed to be good. I came across one that was specifically about BPD, but also a DBT one. That way, while you‚Äôre looking for a suitable and good therapist, you can at least work on something from the comfort of your own home. Best of luck to you. Just don‚Äôt give up and keep trying to make improvements as it will help your marriage. My ex gave up and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to try treatment, please don‚Äôt do the same üòä

Hi Emilie, just out of interest, how do you manage to cope with your bipolar without medication? I ask because someone I know has bipolar and is so fed up with having to take medication all of the time. I was wondering what other effective options there are? I am typically a person who doesn‚Äôt believe that medication is always the right way to go anyway, as there are some amazing alternative therapies out there that work so much better and can be a lot more effective. Have you tried any alternatives to medication?

Certain parts of BPD and NPD are very similar. The difference is the intent in which it‚Äôs done. However, manipulation and control are exactly that and have the same affect on someone, whether it‚Äôs caused by BPD or NPD. My ex is diagnosed BPD and after reading up on the illness following his diagnosis, I have no question in my mind that it‚Äôs BPD that he has. The answer above describes him exactly. I was told by a therapist that BPD was originally named borderline for two main reasons. 1. It borders pretty much all of the cluster B personality disorders. 2. because it borders between reality and psychosis. Therefore, the description above is very much a true account of an certain people with untreated pwBPD, BPD, but does also describe someone with NPD as well.well. It is important to remember that not all sufferers of BPD will fit the above description, but that‚Äôs because there are 256 different variations of BPD that a sufferer can have.

Another really sad part to this is the FP also so often gets so hurt and ends up in a huge amount of pain too. With my ex pwBPD, he absolutely tore me to pieces because he was constantly testing. He caused himself even more pain by doing everything he could to push me away, when all I ever wanted was the best for him and do everything I could for him. It‚Äôs very sad that he was unable to recognise that, which ended up with both of us in immense pain and heartache üòû

And do you know that there is a huge difference between being an empath and showing empathy? In my experiences, some people with BPD do not show empathy, in fact, whenever I was going through awful things such as my Mum having a stroke or a dear friend passing away, my ex wBPD showed me absolutely no empathy or compassion at all. It‚Äôs absolutely not just a specific type of NPD that aren‚Äôt empaths and no person with BPD is the same as the next. It can‚Äôt be generalised in such black and white terms.

I can see what you are saying, I think upbringing does play a huge part in many cases. What I disagree with is that it‚Äôs not always necessarily trauma that causes the disorder, which is something I read very often when it comes to BPD. I have reason to believe it could also be by being given too much love as well. For example, not developing an understanding of your emotions, because someone else (i.e a parent) took on and dealt with those emotions for you, almost as if the parent is codependent on the child. I do believe this can cause BPD as well, as the pwBPD in this scenario, can‚Äôt regulate their emotions, because they never learned to. The fear of abandonment also sits at the centre in this scenario as well, because they have become almost enmeshed with their parent, meaning they fear anyone leaving them as they can‚Äôt cope on their own and never learned how to cope on their own.
I also believe that if it is trauma related, some pwBPD don‚Äôt recognise this as they have blocked the trauma out.
It‚Äôs possible it could also be a neurological disorder.
or, it could be a combination of the above.
it‚Äôs different from each and every sufferer and from articles and research I have read, I think professionals/researchers have only really scratched the surface of BPD and where it comes from. There‚Äôs a lot more that needs to be done to understand the illness more and if more research did take place, I sincerely hope it will help cut through a lot of the stigma‚Äôs attached to the disorder.

It‚Äôs funny you should say that as I have wondered the same thing. My ex really wanted to work with animals, but in order to do that, he needed to complete an animal care and management course. We found a course online and I paid for it for him, hoping it would give him something to focus on and something to aim towards. Also, I hoped it would give him a sense of purpose. However, he never even so much as started it. He constantly said things about not passing the exams or what if he wasn‚Äôt any good at it. I would constantly reassure him that he was wonderful with animals and was very intelligent and that I had every faith in him that he would do really well, but this seemed to make him shy away from doing the course even more. I did say to him before that perhaps he has a deep fear of failure, and he agreed that it was possibly the case.

But it is factually incorrect. Whether you have BPD or not is irrelevant. It doesn‚Äôt mean you know everything about BPD. You do however, know about the combination of BPD symptoms that you have.

That‚Äôs actually incorrect, although yes, people with BPD do have a deep self- loathing and feel immense shame and guilt, it is also very common that they don‚Äôt acknowledge this. What happens is a defence mechanism kicks in, because they can‚Äôt handle the intense guilt and shame that they are feeling.
I am not by any means saying that all people with BPD do this. There are 256 ways in which BPD can display in a sufferer, it is by far a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô disorder.

My BPD ex accused me of so many things, but the one that stands out is that apparently, I have hacked into Sega because I kept beating him at a Sonic racing game and was purposely trying to make his mental health worse by not letting him win. He would say I justified making his mental health worse by paying for him to have therapy (therapy that was a complete waste of money, because all he did was manipulate the therapist!) He was aware of having BPD, but had no interest in working on himself and accepting any accountability for his behaviour towards me. When he went into a rage, he became highly emotionally and mentally abusive, but would make excuses for his behaviour and could never understand the distress he would put me through, instead everything would be twisted around to be my fault and would then gaslight me to say that I remembered things incorrectly, yet accuse me of gaslighting him.
It really is an awful disorder, for both the sufferer and the people around them. I really wish more was done to help people with BPD get into effective treatment, because while they are in denial at just how serious their disorder is, it causes distress to the people in their lives and to themselves.

Take her to a GOOD professional. Please don't take her to the cheapest one or the first one you see, take time on your research. I just turned 19, my family doesn't really know much about what's going on with me, it's really hard for me to open up, when I tried to talk to my mum she said it's for crazy people only. I never show my family any signs of sadness, and that itself is a bad sign. Take it seriously; your daughter might be bottling up a lot of things and it can result to something really bad. But again‚Ä¶ don't take her to any professional without doing research; some prescribe meds that aren't really necessary, meds alone won't cure anything, it might even make it worse, meds are NOT a forever solution.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BELIEVE HER AND GET HER HELP!! Just because she hasn‚Äôt shown the symptoms to you, doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs called masking. Please learn about it. The fact that she‚Äôs reaching out for help is the biggest sign there is.

One trauma that has stayed in my body since I was a teen, yes TRAUMA, was being woken up and yelled at for taking a nap. I was in my teens. I am now in my 30s and cannot take naps in the daytime and on the rare occasions that I'm tired enough to accidentally fall asleep, I wake up in a panic. Do you really want your son to have that kind of trauma for the rest of his life? To be a grown adult who can't even sleep peacefully in their own house? Maybe instead of seeking punishment for him you should seek therapy for yourself. Also get him therapy - he probably needs it to put up with you.

It‚Äôs either a cry for help or a cry for attention but honestly even if it‚Äôs a cry for attention she could probably use a little bit of therapy to get to the bottom of it and find out why she would be acting out this way. Speaking from experience.

When I was pregnant with my second child, I had what is called Cholestasis. (I had it with both pregnancies but my 2nd OB was unbelievably ignorant) Cholestasis is a liver disease that develops during pregnancy and it puts the baby in a high risk position for stillbirth if you go past 37 weeks so it‚Äôs always best to deliver by the 37 week mark. My idiot OB wanted to wait until 39 weeks to deliver and I explained to him the risk you take to do that is my baby‚Äôs life. His exact words were ‚ÄúBe careful what you say‚Äù. WTF is that supposed to mean?! So I refused to leave his office. I just sat there. Said I‚Äôm not going anywhere until you schedule my delivery for 37 weeks (which was the very next day). He finally caved and referred me to a high risk specialist. THAT specialist had me in delivery the very next day. I only WISH she would have been the one to deliver because I was so mad at my OB for not taking me seriously, when this was my SECOND Cholestasis pregnancy.pregnancy, acting like I didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about when I‚Äôve been through it before.

As a younger person that does have mental health issues, you should believe her and get it checked even if she doesn't show symptoms. It would only hurt her more if she does have an issue and you don't believe her. I've told my mom about how I want to be checked for my mental health and she would laugh it off and call me stupid and it really damaged how I thought. Even if she isn't showing symptoms, listen to her and talk to her about it. Don't cut her off and tell her it's a phase or that it's a part of growing up. Encourage her and tell her you're there to help. If she really needs it, let her get a therapist. That could stop her from harming herself and people around her like I did.

Why does my 11-year-old son have naked girls on his phone?
hes discovering his sexuality. it's time, ladies and gents!!!! the dreaded Talk. just make sure you teach him well about consent and respect for any future partners and we're all good. Scarleteen | Sex Education For The Real World is an AMAZING resource for young people figuring out their bodies and gender and sex in easily-digestable terms. it helped me a LOT when i was his age and it'll probably help you plan out how to approach the subject in a loving and caring manner. it's still gonna be awkward as hell, because almost everything about being his age is. but you'll get through it, and your son will come out the other side knowing he can come to you with any questions or worries he has. good luck!!!

because people arent a monolith of their demographic. we as humans have so many variances and oddities between us, and being attracted to someone who has a kid is not exactly groundbreaking or lifeshattering. in fact, i think men who only like virgins are way fuckin weirder than a man who likes someone who's pushed a baby out of their vagina. judging by the amount of fathers who are still with their wives and children, and stepfathers who love their family, i'd actually say virgin-chasers are the weirdos here.

1. Believe your child as a rule of thumb 2. Everyone can benefit from therapy 3. The worst thing that can happen is that the therapist tells her she's well adjusted and sends her home 4. Why would she lie when there's a very negative sigma (that based on this question I assume you perpetuate quite strongly 5. Even if she was ‚Äúlying"" or ‚Äúexaggerating"" and you really don't believe her, wouldn't this attention seeking behavior but still because for therapy? 6. If she is mentally ill, is extremely unlikely that she's never shown symptoms it is far more likely that you have never noticed them. A significant portion of teenagers who attempt suicide have their parents claiming that they didn't show any symptoms. Any doctor will tell you that that's bullshit and the parents just didn't notice 7. Even If you were somehow cer‚Ä¶

How do I confront my daughter about the mean things she said about me to her therapist through a video call that I overheard from her room?
1 you don't
2. She's not being mean she's working up about her experience
3. Maybe consider the things you're doing that cause her to have this perspective of you.

What is the appeal of BDSM sadism? I'm a masochist so I'm so glad that sadists exist, but I just can‚Äôt understand what's appealing about it.
This question made me laugh because I feel the same way about masochists. Im a sadist and and particularly interested in CNC. I love the idea of completely taking control of your body, seeing and causing your automatic pain responses knowing you have no power to stop it, knowing that I have the power to make you scream, hearing you beg for me to stop, etc. It's mostly about power specifically taking power by force. I don't think this is true of everybody, but at least for me I think to a certain extent it's also a form of delayed and hidden masochism. I love what I'm doing at the time and get my own pleasure from that but then after it's done and my sub leaves I feel like a monster - its kind of evil that I could possibly enjoy what I was doing. It's a miserable feeling and I would be deva‚Ä¶

Why do some parents allow their minor daughters to dye their hair?
In 2018 I let my then 11 year old daughter get her hair dyed pink. I took her to a professional hair stylist for consultation, set down the only rule I had - don‚Äôt get the hair bleached all the way to the roots - because I was worried about the effect of chemicals. The rest of the hair would grow out even if it got damaged (which it did). One year later I let her get the ends of her hair dyed blue-green (and joked that she matched our bird, a green cheeked conure). After this she agreed to cut out the bleach-damaged portion of her hair. She‚Äôs thinking about getting it colored again and I‚Äôm gonna let her. Why? Because, in my 22 years of parenting I have learned to pick my battles. I‚Äôd rather lay down the rules where it matters - drugs, alcohol, academics, health and safety. Hair color, nose,‚Ä¶

it varies from person to person (yes kids are people too! :) )
Kids are naturally curious and that‚Äôs why they ask a million questions. That‚Äôs curiosity and a mechanism to learn.
Parent have to make sure their kids are safe and healthy. A lot of questions arise out of that. That‚Äôs not being nosy.
Some people are overly interested in things that are not their business. THAT‚Äôs called being nosy. But there is no way to generalize if a particular group of people is more so than others.

How do you parent adult children? What do adult children need from their parents?
As a parent to an adult child, I treat her as a competent, intelligent adult that she is. I don‚Äôt give advice unless asked, I try not to overstep the boundaries and apologize if I do (what can I say? I am a parent after all!) If she comes to me with her worries, I first ask if she is looking to vent or for advice and respond accordingly. I let her know, from time to time, that her father and I are here to support her any way we can but I don‚Äôt force the support or advice on her. I offer help when she needs it and she knows to ask for it when needed. Overall, I just treat her with the same respect I treat other adults, and what I expect in return from her. Parenting changes as children grow older. Me recognizing that my child is a self-reliant adult and giving her the space she needs is a for‚Ä¶

Does not being strict with your kids help them out more later in life?
It depends on what you‚Äôre being strict with and what you‚Äôre letting slide. Also, helps to remember that the purpose of being strict is to keep them safe and help them learn to eventually be self-dependent adults. It takes practice, and a certain level of zen to learn what‚Äôs important and what‚Äôs not. I was strict with my kids in some matters and indulgent in others. I was stricter in the younger years and loosened the rules as they grew older. My aim was never to control them but to teach them to be self-reliant. I think my older daughter bore more rules than the younger because in raising her I learned what things weren‚Äôt important in the long run. She wants an extra piece of chocolate? Fine! Doesn‚Äôt want to eat broccoli for one meal? Sure! Wants to go to school in mismatched socks and her‚Ä¶

Height or education are not the right criteria for marrying someone. Who do you feel an emotional connection with? Whom do you like more? Which person do you want to spend the rest of your life with. Who is a better person and easier to laugh with? All these, and many other questions, will help you decide which one of them is more compatible with your beliefs and values.
Also, it doesn‚Äôt have to be either one of them. If neither one feels like the partner you‚Äôre looking for then there‚Äôs nothing wrong with waiting for someone else.

Why is it better to develop yourself instead of having children?
Because it will help you grow and be prepared for children later in life, should you want them. And if you don‚Äôt want children, you‚Äôd stil bel in a better place because you took the time to grow and nurture yourself.
Raising children requires a lot of effort, money, time, emotional and mental bandwidth. The more time you take to develop yourself (emotionally, financially, professionally) the better your experience will be as a parent and you‚Äôll be able to give your children a better start in life.

We can‚Äôt always make our kids confide in us - they have their own reasons, right or wrong. Just be glad that she has someone to talk to and, maybe, work on improving communication with her so she feels talking to you is also a good option. You haven‚Äôt indicated how your relationship is with her so I am not going to assume anything. My own kids have occasionally told me their perceptions of me from they were younger and it startled me to be told they assumed I‚Äôd react a certain way when I am NOT that kind of a person. It took my daughters a long time to realize their mother is different from who they have made her out to be. So, don‚Äôt take this personally and just be glad that your daughter is talking to someone.

If your daughter thinks she needs help then get her that help. It‚Äôs that simple. The best case scenario is that it will turn out she never needed that help. But imagine denying her that help if she really needs it.

There is nothing wrong with seeing a therapist ! She doesn‚Äôt have to show symptoms it‚Äôs a feeling. Mental health is so important. When we feel sick because something happened to our body we go visit a doctor.. it‚Äôs exactly the same! Expect it has something to do with our mind our brain . If you‚Äôre daughter thinks that she should go see a therapist ! You should let her it‚Äôs actually amazing that she want to figure it out with professionals! Which means she‚Äôs ready and she actually want to solve whatever is wrong with her.
some kids or teens never have the guts to talk or to express their feelings which makes the situation even worse.

My brother is a year younger than me and is taller and has bigger feet. Why is this?
This can simply be because of genes. For example my dad had severe acne as a kid but my mom didn't. My sister is older than me and barely has any acne like my mom but I have severe acne like my dad. The most probable reason for your difference in appearance is that you both get your genes from different parents.

Hi, I'm the youngest person in my entire (at least 20 immediate) family. My sister is the second youngest and we're both the youngest women in the entire family for almost 20 years. I am emotionally/physically abused by my sister and have been for 6 years going.
For the question of why I haven't moved out, I'm about to be in a whole load of debt from school and I still need to work and crap.
Anyways, to answer your question, yes I am the youngest and have been for almost two decades.
I think the reason why I was abused by my sister was because when I was younger I had a lot of medical issues and surgery. There was a lot of jealousy because of the amount of attention I needed.
It seems like a shit reason now that I'm typing it out and making myself vulnerable to criticism and comments but when it first started I was so angry about it that I didn't have time to process what she was doing.
This is going off-topic of the question but I think the reason why talking about sibling abuse is so uncommon is because there's a stereotype that siblings are the closest things in the world.

Isn‚Äôt YouTube supposed to be for only teens and adults? Why are kids under the age of 13 on YouTube when they should use YouTube Kids?
YouTube Kids is mainly for toddlers and won‚Äôt show any thing that will catch pre-teens attention. Why are you so worried about pre-teens being on YouTube. They‚Äôve been doing it for decades, I imagine, I‚Äôve never even downloaded YouTube kids.

My therapist told me about my selfharm to my mom, what should I do? I had cut open my mouth a little and cut my arms, but it wasn't noticable. I do this because of personal reasons and my mom found out. It wasn't my fault. Now shes probably sad.
That‚Äôs breaking the doctor-patient confidentiality law. You should report your therapist. As for your mom, comfort her and tell her it isn‚Äôt her fault for the self harm (assuming that she hasn‚Äôt done anything to provoke you to do that), then, get an actual therapist.

My daughter started listening to a band that plays the devil‚Äôs music, heavy metal. How do I get her to turn it off permanently?
Uh you don‚Äôt.
The 18th century called, they want you back so you can participate in the witch trials as a witness.
Heavy metal is your daughters way of letting out her feelings and relating to someone. If you make her turn it off, she will hate you. You may consider it a overreaction but you just stole her only way of venting. If I was her I would avoid you for a week at least.

My eight-year-old son got married to a boy at school. I know that it is against of God‚Äôs will and I don't want him to go to hell. What do I say to him?
First of all, if you‚Äôre willing to tell him that he‚Äôs going to hell for loving someone, go right ahead and wait for a call from his teacher asking you to explain why you told him that.
Second of all, he‚Äôs eight he barely knows what he‚Äôs doing. Religious homophobes piss me off the most because you guys base your hate for gays off your religion. So much of what you say contradicts everything. Gods whole schtick is loving everyone. The word homosexual didn‚Äôt even become a word until the 19th century when they translated the Bible, again.
Third of all, If your son wants to date boys, let him. Don‚Äôt go telling him god doesn‚Äôt like when boys lie with each other. That is so damaging towards his mental health and mindset.

My 17-year-old daughter has threatened to leave home if I don't stop tracking her 'monthly cycles'. How can I manage her outburst?
Ooh I know the answer to this one!
You‚Äôre disgusting.
It is one thing to give someone medicine to stop their pain during their cramps but it‚Äôs another to track her cycle. It‚Äôs something private to her.
Before you come out with that bullshit saying that you‚Äôre her mother, you‚Äôre also someone who has to earn her trust, not break it into a million pieces.
About controlling her ‚Äúoutburst,‚Äù it‚Äôs not an outburst, it‚Äôs her being done with you being creepy about something is private that happens with her body, not yours. Not to mention, despite this sounding so little, it could cause her problems in the future with her privacy and mental health.
It‚Äôs not her that needs to be controlled, it‚Äôs you.

I think CPS should called on you. The fact that you don‚Äôt know this was absolutely horribly wrong makes me wonder how terrible you really are to your daughter. I just saw her post about you hitting her and this makes my blood boil. She will probably live in fear of you now and be scared to make the littlest mistake because you were stupid enough to punch her for such a little thing. I‚Äôve been up past two am thousands of times and my parents have always scolded me before leaving my phone on my desk and if I did it again, they hid it, not hit.
You should‚Äôve hid the phone instead of permanently traumatizing her. Not to mention, she could be hiding a sleep disorder from you.

As a daughter of someone who has the exact same mindset as you do on this topic, all I can say is they way you‚Äôre thinking, hurts. I don‚Äôt have children, I‚Äôm not a therapist but I have gone through the therapy that your daughter wants. Your daughter is not 12, she‚Äôs not 8 anymore. She knows what she wants, she has a fully developed mind to know whether or not she okay mentally. Thinking your daughter doesn‚Äôt need therapy just because you haven‚Äôt seen any signs is incredibly hurtful if you ever let her know that. I have a strained relationship with my mother now simply because everytime I wanted therapy she would simply shut me out and refuse because I didn‚Äôt meet the ‚Äúcriteria‚Äù that was in her mindset.

TAKE HER! I cannot express to you how hard it is to ask family for help! And if she hasn't been showing symptoms then there is a good chance she has been keeping these emotions inside. You want a example of what can happen? When I was 8 I was being sexually abused for a year or so (and thanks to this I now hate hugs and physical touch, even from family members) . I asked my parents and teachers for help but no one believed me because I was a child and didn't know how to express what was happening to me. I only asked for help one other time in my life and that was when I was 11. I told him that I was ready to start receiving help, and my dad just told me to draw or write it out (keep in mind during this they knew that I had problems with self harm and would shame me for it).

Just because you feel embarrassed does not necessarily mean that the guy you like has an issue with it. Don‚Äôt be someone you‚Äôre not in order to date a guy you like.

How can you tell if your anxieties are becoming a disorder?
If you describe your experiences to a psychiatrist or therapist and they said, ‚ÄúYou have X disorder.‚Äù You can of course always get a second opinion.
Typically, the most basic issue that makes a disorder into a disorder is in the answer to this question: ‚ÄúDoes X symptom prevent me from doing things or making it extremely difficult to do things such as going to school, going to work, difficulty with relationships of all kinds, etc.?‚Äù Essentially, does it make you feel like it is getting in the way of you going about your life?

How can I deal with severe anxiety without self-harm?
The other folks who have responded to your question are mostly giving you good advice. The only part I disagree with is ‚ÄúYou should just relax.‚Äù I disagree with this because, as someone with at least three different anxiety diagnoses, I know that ‚Äújust relax‚Äù does not work when someone has severe anxiety. It is dismissive, a bit invalidating, and, even though ‚Äújust relax‚Äù was probably meant with a good heart, it still does not address the problem. Seeking psychiatric and counseling care to get to the root of your anxiety is incredibly important. Unfortunately, many of us don‚Äôt have the money for that. There are, however, some places that are like community health services that will work with you to provide you care at a more reasonable cost for folks with lower to no income. I am not someone‚Ä¶

Depends on which Quaker you‚Äôre asking. On top of that, there are non-violent ways of self-defense.
For me, the peace testimony is not as black-and-white as non-Quakers seem to presume. There are a lot of gray areas. And those gray areas are different for each individual.
Will I defend myself from domestic violence? If I have to in order to escape, then yes. Escalating conversations shouldn‚Äôt turn to violence/domestic abuse. The situation should be diffused by both parties taking a couple of minutes to cool off, then readdress the matter by conversing with the love you have for that person and talking to the Light in that person. Have a discussion that gets to the root of whatever the disagreement is about. If someone is upset with you, it‚Äôs never about spilling milk on the counter or any other mundane accidental situation. If that doesn‚Äôt work, get out of that place, physically leave that situation.
If someone is attacking me, someone I love, my neighbors‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt sit back and watch. I have white privilege and I believe that ‚Äúwhite silence is violence.‚Äù After noticing the cops showing up several times at my neighbor‚Äôs door, which is right next to mine, I started to feel concerned for my neighbors‚Äô wellbeing because my neighbors are black, this country is drenched with racism, and I don‚Äôt trust the police‚Äîespecially because of the 1033 program that militarizes the police: police are given surplus military-grade items including machines and weaponry. So one day when I saw one of my neighbors, I approached them and I told him that if the police are making them uncomfortable or fearful, just knock on my door and, if I am home, I will stand there as a witness and record the whole thing on video. I hadn‚Äôt ever spoken to my neighbors until that day. Now whenever we see each other, we greet each other and comment on the weather. I believe having bonds with your neighbors, bonds with your communities, are very Quakerly.
Again, I have white privilege. If I see someone attacking another person‚Äîespecially someone who is a minority‚Äîthen I will step in because I believe that being a bystander, allowing that attack to continue, is violence. And, like I said, ‚Äúwhite silence is violence.‚Äù
Most people appear to instinctually have responses of ‚Äúself-preservation.‚Äù But, I posit that the opposite is true as well: that we also have an instinct for altruism. Some of that is empathy, but I think some of it is also a very wide definition of ‚Äúself.‚Äù Who am I? I am connected to my fiance, I am connected to my family, I am connected to my friends and neighbors, I am connected to the state I live in, the country I live in, and most of all, I am connected to all beings on this planet and the Earth herself. With that in mind, any violence is self-violence.
In terms of war‚ÄîI‚Äôm over thirty years old and there has never been a moment of my life that the United States has not been involved in military actions. There hasn‚Äôt been peace in this country for over three decades! I will never join the United States in battle. I will continue to pressure Congress to demilitarize the police. Well-adapted adults are able to understand their differences, speak diplomatically, do their best to diffuse the situation, etc. And in case this still needs repeating: there are no holy wars.
I have seen so many ribbons and bumper stickers that say ‚ÄúSupport our Troops,‚Äù I really wonder‚Äîwhat exactly does that mean? Who is ‚Äúnot‚Äù supporting American troops that we‚Äôre wasting our time on making ribbons and bumper stickers for? I think that phrase is, using a term Quakers use, empty. It is empty of meaning.
Anyway, that‚Äôs just one Quaker‚Äôs rambling about whether or not they would use self-defense if under attack. I know there are Quakers who disagree with me on this and that‚Äôs okay! I hope some of them chime in.

You have a mental health disorder of some kind (sounds like social anxiety, but don‚Äôt take a random person‚Äôs diagnosis as fact). The fact that it is disrupting your every day life is a sure sign it‚Äôs a disorder. If you have the means, seek a therapist and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist will know better than random people on the internet about whether or not meds will help you. Go get help from a professional.

At that point, you are well beyond when you should have cut that person out of your life. If they go to therapy, great. If they improve, even better. But if your relationships is at the point of ‚ÄúI need to be in control and make sure you never leave me because I can‚Äôt be alone or I‚Äôll start self-reflecting‚Ä¶ so I will only seek help if you stay!‚Äù Never let people pull that on you.

It know if the article is relevant to my studies, I‚Äôll just read the abstract before even bothering with the rest of the article. If I think that the knowledge in the article would help inform the question I‚Äôm asking, then I speed read through parts that are unnecessary for my research purposes and then slow down to take notes where appropriate.

My blind mother and all my friends who are blind would probably take offense to the phrase ‚Äúreading the actual book,‚Äù as if audiobooks do not have the same exact content. Trust me, folks who listen to audio books retain the information just fine.

I guess you could say that I ‚Äúspeed read‚Äù articles to inform my research papers, but otherwise, I don‚Äôt speed read. I prefer to read slowly. I can find more depth to any topic when I take it slow and absorb the information. I used to have an app that would supposedly train me in speed reading. You would have the words flash before your eyes, one at a time, and you could set the speed and periodically increase it as you improved. What was it called? Beats me, but a quick search and this list of apps showed up:

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
She doesn‚Äôt need to show any symptoms to want/need a therapist. I would automatically believe her, but I‚Äôm not the parent of your adult child (18). If she‚Äôs wanting to go to a therapist ‚Äî‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù or ‚Äúno symptoms‚Äù‚Äîyou‚Äôre missing something. No one who is actually ‚Äúfine‚Äù would ask to see a therapist. Like you, I presume, folks don‚Äôt want the stigma of being mentally unhealthy. I go to therapy. It‚Äôs probably more common than you think. But if you don‚Äôt support your daughter in her seeing a therapist, then she might not trust you with her feelings again. Or maybe she was afraid this is how you‚Äôd respond in the first place.

How do I find my real purpose in life?
If there is a ‚Äúreal purpose‚Äù in life, as far as I can tell we never get a certified letter from the universe letting us know we found it. I‚Äôm not playing word games here; I really genuinely mean what I‚Äôm about to ask: WHY do you need a purpose? Really ask yourself and get specific. Do you think you‚Äôd feel happier if you settled on some ‚Äúreal purpose?‚Äù Or do you think you‚Äôd get into heaven? Or be fantastically rich? I find people usually think that if they found their ‚Äúreal purpose‚Äù (as if there is one) then suddenly they‚Äôd be happy. They use this super vague idea of a real purpose that they haven‚Äôt found as a way to understand why they feel totally natural things like confusion, aimlessness, and disappointment in life. But those are just part of the human experience. What you CAN do is have‚Ä¶

Ask her how you can assist her in finding a therapist.
Then ask yourself why you don‚Äôt believe someone when they tell you they think they would benefit from seeing a therapist.
Anyone, no matter how emotionally secure and stable, can benefit from talking to someone about their thoughts and feelings.

If Americans could do their fucking job he wouldn't need to hire someone from overseas, but as you can see, many people outside your patriotic bubble speak more than 2 languages, and are much more ready to work than your kids that went to IVY League Universities.

My husband wants to quit his high paying IT job and start his laundry business. My parents are totally against it. I am finding it difficult to choose either of them. What should I do?
First of all, is it your job? No, then the only thing you cn do is support him. As a person that works in IT, the money does not compensate the stress or your mental health.

I would let my kid buy Minecraft, but I hear all this talk about creepers using it. I don't feel safe letting my child buy it. Can any other parent agree with me?
Hi! I'm a Cybersecurity researcher and creeps are all over the Internet. Minecraft is a great game for kids to learn and also have a lot of fun. I would let my kids use them under a controlled server I own so no one I don't know can join. Don't get kids away from videogames just learn how to protect them, give them best practices and let them trust you so in any case they see something weird they will let you know immediately.

Can I keep my cat in a room all the time?
I wouldn't leave one cat alone in a room for long. I have two cats and they mostly stay in one room. A couple of times a day they get supervised time in the hallway. They have water, food, lots of vertical space, toys, a big window, a litter box, and each other. I'm not able to sleep in the same room as the litter box, and am limited in space at the moment. Also, a dog also lives in the space, and it is not safe for them to be together without close supervision, and the doors get opened for the dog regularly. The cats would absolutely escape and would likely die. When it was just me and the cats in a 2-bedroom apartment they had mostly free reign except when I was out for work or whatever (so that they couldn't get into the kitchen cabinets or escape when I opened the front door).

My cat doesn't like his vegetable food, but I can't give him meat (I'm a vegan). How can I make him understand that vegetables are good for him? Children are often the same, but eventually they learn.
I'm assuming you are a troll, but in case someone else seriously has this question: Not feeding meat to your cats is animal abuse. They literally need it. Even humans are not supposed to be vegan or vegetarian. Not that we necessarily are supposed to consume the milk of other animals, but we are omnivores. Being a healthy vegan or even vegetarian as a human is possible with help from a nutritionist and usually supplements, but it is tricky and often expensive. Bottom line, cats need meat. Most of their protein should be from meat. They can have some veggies as a supplement, as in the wild cats are eating the stomachs and intestines of vegetarian animals, but if you haven't done an insane amount of research, just feed them a good wet food made just for cats (I recommend Tiki Cat) and maybe a‚Ä¶

Do autistic children ever feel that they are in the wrong body, or wish to be neurotypical? If so, how does it come about? What happens when they realize it is impossible for them to change?
I can only answer for myself, although some of my autistic friends have expressed feeling similarly. I'm 29 now, and have NEVER felt like I belonged. I feel like a fairy trapped in a human body with these weird humans with their weird customs that are illogical AND aren't even enjoyable. I feel connected to the Earth. I feel excessive empathy towards others, but not much sympathy. I can feel their pain, but I don't always get it. Friends have mentioned feeling like robots, aliens, or goblins.

Should my son see a therapist for becoming so obsessed with Kanye West?
One needs more context here before judging the situation.
What do you mean by obsessed? Is it like being obsessed with any other artist?
Is your son specifically influenced by his ideology? Then it might be a good time to sit with him and have a talk about the same.
How old is your son? Is he too young to understand the severity of your concern?
Either ways, it doesn't seem like an alarm to me. Sending him to therapy forcefully might cause a strain in your relationship. It might lead him to believe that there is something wrong with him. Best thing to do here is to sit and calmly talk about why he's obsessed with him. Teach him why not to blindly follow people, especially celebrities.

Is it wrong for your parents to butt in your therapy sessions? I'm 18. I feel there's no reason to do therapy by myself if my dad and stepmom are going to criticize what I tell my therapist. What should I do? I got yelled at yesterday for it.
You're an adult and your parents don't need to know everything that's going on in your life. Your therapist shouldn't be telling your parents anything without your consent. Have you tried communicating to your therapist that you are not comfortable with them telling your parents everything?
If the therapist does not understand your needs it may be time to change your therapist. Additionally, even after changing therapist, if the parents still insist on knowing what is happening in the sessions, let them know about your goals and progress in therapy, without giving out any other details.

Some overweight people try so hard to get rid of excess belly fat with well balanced diet and weight supplements they cannot get rid of belly fat.What are the alternative methods to burn excess belly fat?
Spot reduction of fat is a myth. For overall fat loss, the key is Calorie Deficit + Exercise. Simply put, burn more calories than you eat. In addition to this, consuming more fibre & protein and drinking a lot of water also helps fat loss.

Also, don't fall for fad diets like Keto. They cause more harm than good. Various research articles also support this view.

Hi. I know you have received lots of answers for this question already. I hope you and your daughter are doing okay. As a mother, it must‚Äôve come as surprise and been difficult to hear it from your own child‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòMental health‚Äô is just our way of being and the way we see and interact with the world, so it‚Äôs okay to talk about it. It‚Äôs okay that your daughter is aware and would like to explore further. However, like many people are saying here, it can be something really serious, so any ‚Äòcry for help‚Äô should be taken seriously. It is never ‚Äònothing‚Äô. Even in the case of a young person looking for attention, one should wonder why they‚Äôre seeking it in the first place‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs really good that your daughter spoke to you and opened up to you.

In general situations, as in talking with your friends, families or praising children, most of the suggested words/phrases here can be used.
Just be mindful of the fact that if the listener is in ‚Äòhigher‚Äô position, ie:your boss, ‚Äòpraising‚Äô them can be seen as socially awkward (or unacceptable even). In this case, one might thank them for their support rather than praising them.
If you have close enough relationship with your boss, saying congratulations (omedeto-gozaimas) should also be okay.

How true is it that saying ""arigato"" at a store would be acceptable for a foreigner but rude for a native Japanese?
There are 3 points in this question: 1. Arigato vs Arigato-gozaimas. The one is casual and the other is polite. If you‚Äôre more experienced Japanese speaker, you know when and how to differentiate them. If you‚Äôre a tourist, just use whichever is easier for you. The point here is that you are expressing your feeling of gratitude in the language you don‚Äôt know well - there is nothing rude about that. 2. Saying ‚Äòthank you‚Äô to a shop employee. The Japanese tend not to say much to shop employees in general. Even when a store clerk says ‚Äòwelcome!!!‚Äô (often over enthusiastically), customers just ignore and go on shopping. This is completely normal. However, when you had a direct interaction with a shop employee, ie: they found a book that you‚Äôre looking for, people say ‚Äòthank you‚Äô. Some people say it to t‚Ä¶

How can I learn Japanese faster and make it more fun?
My guess is that you have probably been learning Japanese for a while, but feeling a bit stuck somehow? Frustrated that you are not progressing as quickly as you did with other languages maybe? And perhaps feeling that it‚Äôs not fun anymore?
Do you have the opportunity to practice your Japanese? If you haven‚Äôt done so, maybe find a language exchange friend. You‚Äôll get to actually ‚Äòuse‚Äô the language and be surprised how much you know!
The other thing is to consider finding a teacher (again, if you haven‚Äôt done so already). Not only the teachers can guide and teach you, but having someone to talk with and learn together makes your learning experience so much more sociable and meaningful.
Enjoy!

Okay so I am learning a new language (Japanese) and I can recognize any letter from the first syllabary (Hiragana) usually after .5 - 1 second. should I start learning katakana yet or should I become faster at hiragana?
You don‚Äôt really need to be ‚Äòfast‚Äô at recognising, but make sure you are ‚Äòreading‚Äô the text meaningfully.
If you haven‚Äôt done so already. Find a Japanese language learning textbook and have a go at reading Hiragana. At the end of the day, you want to be able to read and understand what‚Äôs written, and also sound them out correctly.
If you feel that you are comfortable (you don‚Äôt have to be 100% confident) with reading in Hiragana. Then yes, you‚Äôre definitely ready for Katakana practice!

What are the rules to leave spaces between words when using kanji and kana (grammar, kanji, particles, hiragana, Japanese)?
Êó•Êú¨„Å´Êù•„ÇãÊôÇ„ÅØ„ÄÅËñ¨„ÄÅËæûÊõ∏„ÄÅÊóÖË°å„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ„Å™„Å©„ÇíÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶„Åè„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„Çà„ÄÇ(when you come to Japan, you should bring things like medicine, dictionary and/or travel guide. Nihon ni kuru toki wa, kusuri, jisho, ryoko-gaido nado o mottekuru to iidesu yo.)
As you can see in the sentence above, we don‚Äôt actually have spaces within a sentence, but use „Äå„ÄÅ„Äç(called ‚Äòto-ten‚Äô, more commonly known as ‚Äòten‚Äô).
There are different rules for using ten, but often used after the topic „Äå„ÅØ„Äçand when you are listing things as in the example above.
Beginner‚Äôs textbooks may sometimes separate words like:
„Å´„Åª„Çì„ÄÄ„Å´„ÄÄÊù•„Çã„Å®„Åç„ÄÄ„ÅØ„Éª„Éª„Éª
this is because the textbooks can not use too many kanji at this point and using mostly only hiragana, it‚Äôs easier to read this way.
Hope this answers your question :-) By the way, „Äå„ÄÇ„Äçis Japanese full-stop.

If you want to live in Japan but don't speak Japanese and don't know much about Japan or their culture, what should you do?
If you feel that you ‚Äòwant to‚Äô live in Japan, then maybe you already know something about Japanese culture? Or maybe you really don‚Äôt know almost anything about Japan but somehow you‚Äôre feeling the connection? Try to learn the language even just for a bit of fun. There are many free resources online. Then see how you go and how you feel - will your feeling about moving to Japan change, or maybe get stronger? If you still feel the same, and when the world is safer for travelling again, go visit Japan as a tourist, then again, evaluate your thoughts and feelings.

How do you distinguish what ‚Äúhai‚Äù means in Japanese?
How do you distinguish‚Ä¶ depends on the context.
Most of times ‚Äòhai‚Äô is used as a simple ‚Äòyes‚Äô ‚ÄòI see‚Äô or ‚ÄòI understand‚Äô.
‚ÄòHai‚Äô is also used to let the speaker know that you‚Äôre listening, doesn‚Äôt always mean that you‚Äôre agreeing with them. But I guess this is similar in English?
If ‚ÄòHai?‚Äô comes with a slight question tone at the end, that‚Äôs ‚Äòwhat? (I couldn‚Äôt catch that)‚Äô. But this can sound impolite (unless you get the tone EXACTLY right‚Ä¶) so I‚Äôd not use it.
In terms of understanding what others are saying, it‚Äôs usually clear in the situation and context, so you shouldn‚Äôt worry too much. :-)

What does the particle, „ÇÑ mean in Japanese? I keep seeing articles that say it means etc., but then another article says it means and.

What is the most efficient way for an American in his/her sixties to become fluent in Japanese?
I agree with many others about living/studying in Japan being the ‚Äòmost efficient‚Äô. If that is something you can and you want to, great!
Age really doesn‚Äôt matter. The more you learn, the further your ‚ÄòJapanese brain‚Äô develops, making connections, building up knowledge‚Ä¶
Whatever the methods/ you choose, keep it realistic and meaningful to you. Find your learning style, have fun, as staying interested and motivated is very important. That being said, having a good solid foundation grammatically from an early stage is crucial. So, learning from a text book and/or a tutor is highly recommended.

How do you say ‚Äúreally?‚Äù in Japanese?
„Åª„Çì„Å®„ÅÜÔºü (honto-?, literally ‚Äòreally?‚Äô) is commonly used. Casual-friendly.

„Åù„ÅÜ„Åß„Åô„Åã (so-des ka) has more ‚Äòoh-reallyy--‚Äô ‚ÄòI see-‚Äô ‚ÄòIs that right?‚Äô kind of nuance to it. Make sure you end with a low pitch „Åã (ka) sound as ‚Äòso-des ka?‚Äô with a high pitch ‚Äòka‚Äô can sound like disagreement.

Is translating non-Japanese songs into Japanese a good way to practice?
If that‚Äôs the song you really love and enjoy, yes, I‚Äôd say go for it! Using your interest is always a powerful learning tool!
The only thing is that as song lyrics are often written in certain way in many languages, maybe not the most helpful in terms of practicing grammar/natural expressions. But it will help you with learning new vocabularies whether you‚Äôre a learner of Japanese, or a Japanese speaker who is learning other language.

In most situations, you can just say ‚Äò„ÅØ„ÅÑ (hai)?‚Äô which as you probably know is ‚Äòyes‚Äô with a slight rising tone at the end.

Maybe it's not ‚Äúall of a sudden"". I went years suffering in silence, never showing any ‚Äúsigns"" because I was told I was faking it, when I asked for help from my mother. Now I've been taking care of my mental health, and know I cannot rely on my mother for help.
So they way I see it, you can either help her get help (it could work and be good for her or it could be for nothing) OR you could ignore her cry for help, and she may never rely on you again.
All I know is if/when my daughters cry for help, I will hear them and act.

You should believe her 100% she‚Äôs an 18 year old now, she knows what she is talking about and it‚Äôs really not up to you to decide whether or not is she is ¬´ suitable ¬ª to see a therapist.

Do you believe you have the capability to determine whether the symptoms of mental health issues are there or not, if yes then your question is irrelevant if not simply take her where she can get help before it gets worse

Can playing Fortnite negatively affect a person's mental health in the long run?
I think somewhere playing Fortnite increases focus and stability of mind , this game Ofcourse needs a lot of concentration and practice ! It somewhere makes the person consistent and concentrated as for the positive pact but the longer the screen time the more affect on mind and eyes ! It does makes a person addictive if played continuously and addiction of everything is statedly bad

I go to through the same thing and I haven‚Äôt found any solution i mean my family has been dysfunctional since i was born all i kept seeing my whole life was my family fighting which included my parents and grandmother and when accelerated even my aunts im 20 . So I eventually i did stop caring about that i became i dont give a fuck u what ever u want im done with this shit and when my father decided to do second marriage my dad was cheating and is cheating on my mom I didn‚Äôt felt anything im schizophrenic too btw and i dont cry. The whole life being emotionally neglected that she is just a kid the fights wont affect her distrubed my emotional pattern so i just stay with a straight face. Today my aunt mama‚Äôs sister and my mama were talking and saying that your kids dont feel anything blah blah blah they dont even care about who is there life anchor who sacrificed everything so they can have a whole family and blah blah blah those who dont care why do u care about them leave them. But the thing is i do care alot and i greatfull of what she did for us but i can‚Äôt control the straight face act or all this emotional shit i cant i have never been able to express how can u expect me now yes i can‚Äôt control my anger it gets triggered its too much its not in control i get delusions of anything and everything so they r triggers. But everything i do i wrong everything i say is wrong everything i feel is wrong even when the other dies the same. Oh and lets not forget she thinks im the reason behind every fight. I do feel i do care but i cant express it all i have been trained to do my whole life was i dont give a fuck now its new. But the fact that she thinks that we dont care at all about her when in every fight we were the one in her support does hurts like shit. Especially when mama and my aunt were talking and saying that the kids dont give fuck they dont care about they should care about u so i don‚Äôt really know what to do im stuck in the same thing

How do I respond to a guy who called me a ""good girl"" over a text?
Im in a long distance relationship and my boyfriend loves calling me a good girl. and if im being honest I really love it its his way of showing affection he isnt much of emotion showing person or not much romantic too but he uses this word as an affection showing. So I usually reply by sending him a heart or saying why thank u or yes im your good girl which he really loves or sometimes I usually tell him how much i love when he says stuff like this or what him saying stuff like this does to me i use my own word for butterflies like i say tush tush which he loves so it actually depends upon the person u are talking to mostly

Your daughter is struggling . If she is lying let the therapist conclude that. If she is lying, that shows that there is a blatant problem needed to be addressed with a therapist. It takes so much courage to even admit that you need help. It is better to be safe and take her to the therapist than to ignore someone calling out for help!
Suicide is real and you would never want to be one of the causes of losing your daughter forever.
Mental health is real. Please take it seriously.

Why is crying for a woman considered weak?
I feel like ever since the start of time it‚Äôs been like that. Crying is considered weak because people have been grown and raised to not cry and to be strong. Like crying is just really how some show their emotions instead of keeping stuff bottled up

Your daughter most likely has been hiding her feelings and is deciding to open up to you for help, not a lot of people want therapists for attention haha! sometimes mental health issues can have symptoms that are very easy to stuff deep down inside. if you don‚Äôt want to offer a therapist, she can try exercising, eating healthy foods, and finding a stress reliever that works for her. (such as reading, drawing, singing, playing an instrument or a sport, or even starting a new favorite tv show!)

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Take her to a PSYCHOLOGIST not a therapist, who can assess your daughter and possibly diagnose her. Therapists and councillors can‚Äôt do this. Just because somebody appears to have no mental health issues, doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have any so don‚Äôt be suprised if she‚Äôs diagnosed with something. Be supportive, not judgemental.

Would you leave a medical practice because they‚Äôve gone ‚Äòwoke‚Äô, with new histories asking about ‚Äòpreferred pronouns‚Äô and how you ‚Äòidentify‚Äô? What does this have to do with the practice of medicine?
If by ‚Äòwoke‚Äô you mean scientifically accurate? Literally medical science has acknowledged the difference between sex and gender for a while now and it has a MASSIVE impact on patient care. HOLISTIC care is incorporated into every aspect of medicine and patient care never includes just symptomatic treatment. Have you ever heard of mental health lmao?

I'm a young sociopath still figuring things out, what are some tips from people educated in psychology?
Considering that sociopathy isn‚Äôt medically recognised anymore and you literally can‚Äôt be diagnosed with it, I‚Äôd start there. If you‚Äôre concerned see a psychologist to get properly diagnosed and you will find that you would likely be diagnosed with ASPD (Anti-social Personality Disorder) which has replaced sociopathy, narcissism and psychopathy.

My daughter is 17 and she still hasn't gotten her first period. Is this an indication of her being trans, and what should I do?
I don't think that means she's trans. It's probably a hormone imbalance or something. Try having her see a doctor.

My 19-year-old son hangs out with only 13-17 year olds. Should I be concerned?
If it's just as friends, I don't think you have much to worry about. It could be anxiety? It may be different, but for me personally, I hang out with a lot of people who are 14 and under (I'm 17). It's not cause of any weird reason, I just have a hard time making friends or even just talking to people my age.

My 17 year old son is asking me if he can date a 12 year old girl that lives near us. Should I allow him to date?
Dating is normal at that age. What isn't normal is dating someone with that big of an age gap. For her sake, please don't allow it. At that age, I tried to date people older than me and it really fucked with my mental health. It isn't good for a young mind that is just barely developing and figuring out what's right and wrong in a relationship, what they want and don't want, and what's healthy or unhealthy. Let him date, but please please please urge him to find somebody closer to his own age.

Can a 17 year old guy and a 13 year old girl make a relationship?
Yes and no-
You could pursue it but keep in mind, 13 year olds are still children. They can't process or comprehend what a healthy relationship is or what it looks like. And I'm not sure they've learned communication at that point. Not to mention with the age gap, you could get in trouble eventually. Also- it's kinda just morally wrong to be nearly legal and dating someone who's just barely a teenager.

Depends on the person. I love dating people with a slightly big age gap, but others want to date people similar or within the same age range. It depends on preference. And laws depending on where you live- probably a terrible idea to date someone underage. I'd be very concerned-

I got my first boyfriend when I was 12 and kept dating from their. Trust me, it messes you up. From then til now it's been a string of confusion, no communication, and toxic, unhealthy relationships. For you, that might be differen. It's different for everyone. But at that age, dating is new. Communication, what's healthy or not, what's good and bad for a relationship, we know none of it cause we're simply too young haven't learned it. So yes, I think they're absolutely right.

How can I find out what my daughter (16) is doing on her laptop the whole day when she refuses to tell me?
Listen, if she won't tell you, it's probably nothing at all. Teenagers spend time playing games, chatting with their friends, or watching youtube videos about random things. Especially at that age. She probably just wants a little privacy. As teenagers, we don't want our parents going through every Google search and message. Not cause there's something to hide, just cause we simply want privacy. And quick note, if you try and go through her things without her knowledge, that'll only lead to her finding ways to keep things a secret and she'll most likely never trust you near her things again.

My 15-year-old son got a girl pregnant. I think he should take responsibility, but at the same time he‚Äôs too young to be a dad. What should I do?
Have him take responsibility, and take the mother's feelings into account too. Assuming they're similar in age if not the same, it must be scary for both of them. Not just him. If she decides to keep it, it isn't the end of his teenage years. It'll most likely stay the same, just with more responsibility as a parent.

What kind of tips do you suggest for building a better relationship with my 14-year-old daughter?
Hi! I remember at that age, my mom and dad divorced about a year before. I don't know why, but my mom started trying to get closer with me. She wasn't too pushy, she never forced me to hang out or anything. It was always casual stuff like ‚Äúlet's go shopping‚Äù or ‚Äúhey! Wanna get our ears pierced together?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow about you and I go out for dinner?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy don't we get our nails done"" or she'd just simply talk to me about things like makeup, her interest in wine, etc. Now, I have social anxiety. So sometimes that would keep me from going out with my mom. But she made an effort, and I saw that. After that, I was so much more comfortable with my mom. Nowadays I open up to her about a lot of things and I think we're very close. Whereas, when I was younger, we fought a lot and argued. I really appr‚Ä¶

Hi. I'm a 17 years old girl. I deal with severe depression and anxiety and I'm on meds. But things seem to get worse and worse. I cannot afford going to therapy. Is there anything I can do besides taking meds to get better?
Hey, same age! But, not the point- It depends on your interests. Usually the way I cope is with music, because I love music. And honestly, this might sound odd, but a good crying session always seems to help. Or maybe mix them? Crying session plus music. It's different for everyone though, so what I find super helpful, might not be helpful for you. It's always worth a try though. :)

Hi! I hope this helps a little bit. I'm 17, almost 18. I've dealt with mental health issues since I was about 11 and a half. As someone who has, I can tell you with 100% confidence that if your child doesn't want you to know, you won't. In most cases it might not be that they don't trust you or are lying, it's just that they could be scared. Scared of what you might think, or just scared that they'll hurt others in letting you know. I've dealt with anxiety and depression for a long time now. I also had a history of self-harm, and I didn't want my family to know. They didn't until around 2 years ago when I actually felt comfortable telling them. My point is, people who struggle with mental illness can be right under your nose but if they really want to, they can hide it. Very well, actually. So please, always believe your child when they say they're going through it. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, especially to a parent, and say ‚ÄúHey, I'm going through a lot right now and I need help.‚Äù

Alec Baldwin was on a set with a reasonable expectation that the equipment he was given to use was ‚Äòmock‚Äô.
You see, he had several people before him handle that firearm and drop the ball in handing it to him.
The set armourer wasn‚Äôt even supposed to have real bullets on set to begin with, especially not near props.
The propmaster was supposed to have a second set of eyes on all props used by actors, thus giving a second failsafe.
Then, likely, there was Alec‚Äôs assistant, who‚Äôd hand him things he needed.
That‚Äôs a chain of custody, all of whom should have been checking the item in question, before Alec got it.
Thus, by your argument, they are all equally liable for the death which happened at their negligence.
Now, if your argument is that anyone should treat a firearm (even a pretend one) as if it‚Äôs loaded? I absolutely agree. Alec should have ALSO checked.
Still, it‚Äôs a glaring issue that many actors do not own firearms and are not trained to use them, yet use mock ones in movies, and this is not the first time such a thing has happened.
The armourer is, 100% of the time, educated in the handling of firearms. Perhaps, to stop future deaths, all armourers should also be certified instructors and educate actors on correct firearm usage with a real tool before they use a pretend one which shoots blanks and likely does not have a barrel which would accomodate a round?

What would happen if I forcibly disarmed every person I saw open carrying a rifle to ensure they don't hurt anyone?
Well, let‚Äôs cover the legality before we cover the hypothetical. If you live in the United States then ‚Äòforcibly diarmament‚Äô of a law abiding citizen violates multiple laws. Law 1. Assault. This varies from state to state the level of that crime. Simple and Aggravated Assault Laws in Pennsylvania The charges may be compounded depending on the scenario and you could be facing multiple felonies. Law 2. Theft. This splits into two counts, depending on the cost of the firearm. ‚ÄîIf that rifle is valued at $2,000 or greater then it is a felony called ‚Äògrand theft‚Äô. ‚ÄîThe theft of a firearm, itself, is also a felony in the second degree. You could pay up to $25,000 AND be imprisoned for a decade for that alone. Law 3. Violation of civil rights; The Second and Fourth Amendments (bare minimum). These are federal level crime‚Ä¶

Mr. Smith, as you‚Äôre you‚Äôve righly pointed out with your ‚ÄòGrant County‚Äô example, an agency which does nothing has no socially agreed upon moral or ethical benefit; it is simply an economic drain.

The issue is not funding to CPS/CYS.

NONE of those children were ever removed and I‚Äôm aware of several deaths resulting from such negligence.
HOWEVER, I have personally seen children removed from loving families where the child was simply sickly and there was no medically observable abuse.
Tax dollars would be better spent crewing an EMT-B and LEO in their own vehicle specific for DV/Abuse calls. The LEO would know the law, the first responder would abserve observe the abuse or lackthereof to the participants AND be there to begin treatment if need be.
The Foster system needs a rework too. Assuming CPS/CYS actually does their job and removes a child from a poor environment it‚Äôs not unusual for abuse to continue in that system and sometimes even worse than what they were taken from.

""During his first 20 years in Congress,"" Obama said, ""he opposed every civil rights bill that came up for a vote, once calling the push for federal legislation a farce and a shame."" ‚ÄîBarack H. Obama April 10, 2014 at the LBJ Library.
Was H.R. 7152 introduced by a Democrat?
Sure, specifically one from New York.
Did LBJ champion it? Also true.
This was influenced by FDR‚Äôs ‚ÄòNew Deal‚Äô which caused massive harm to this country BUT brought many black American voters to the Democratic party.
Regardless, we can see who voted to pass the bill.
Republicans: 27 yea, 6 nay.
Democrats: 46 yea, 21 nay.
My statement is not inaccurate. It was adamantly opposed.
It also isn‚Äôt untrue when you look at total votes.
It‚Äôs pretty telling when only 6 vote against a bill out of 33. That says perhaps they did not like the wording, or there was another nuance they took issue with.
Conversely when you have 21 vote nay out of 66 that‚Äôs a much bigger picture, especially when their party submitted the bill to begin with.
Then there‚Äôs the clue about the region. Those states look familiar in regards to my first post?
That, sure, many Democrats may have ‚Äòjumped ship‚Äô, but so what? Despite the fact I loathe partisanship, I still acknowledge it is someone‚Äôs choice to switch parties at their leisure if their worldview changes.
Above are the votes from the 2020 election between Biden and Trump.
I repeatedly hear ‚ÄòThe Bible Belt‚Äô is mostly Republican. This impression is given because of maps which show completed votes per state, but do not show counties nor individual areas.
When we‚Äôre looking at Senate and Congress, sure. A simplification of states works because it‚Äôs very few people.
When we‚Äôre talking about 330 million people, we need to analyze it differently.
As you can see from this image, those selfsame states who voted against the bill LBJ ended up pushing for ‚Äîdespite his history of prejudice‚Äî have not changed. The voters still vote the same.
It‚Äôs more rational to operate under the premise that the Democratic party had a schism, than to operate under the patently false notion that LBJ ‚Äòkicked the racists from his party and this made the Republicans racists‚Äô.

Yes. All parties suck. Some simple simply suck a heck of a lot more than others.
A little history here.
The Democratic party was formed in 1828 by Andrew Jackson; Old Hickory.
Jackson was a racist and a slave collector, if I recall correctly he got to number 33 while in office.
Policy from the Democratic party pushed the US into war 30is 30ish years later. Not a single member of the Democratic party were on the side of Lincoln, to my knowledge.
This was their proposed constitution: Constitution of the Confederate States; March 11, 1861
Within two years of the Civil War the KKK was formed specifically to suppress the black vote as well as cause problems for Republican voters.
Every single KKK member was a Democrat.
The problems with terrorism from the KKK that in 1871 the ‚ÄòKu Klux Klan Act‚Äô was passed by congress authorizing military to deal with its members.
Up until the year 2,000, every single human rights act which was proposed to be passed was adamantly opposed by membership of that party.
Now. Don‚Äôt take anything I said as truth. Research it for yourself. Go down each one of my points here, starting with the founding, and see if I‚Äôm wrong.
Then, by all means, do the same for the Republican party starting with their formation in Ripon, WI 1854.
One of my biggest issues with that party was Abraham Lincoln making it to office despite not being on the ballot in many US states, but I have other issues with that party as well.

‚ÄúUntil 1920, the below image was used nationally across the US and until 1960, it was still used in some states:
Specifically, in Alabama it was still used until 1966.‚Äù
That quote from my post invalidates your reply.
‚Ä¶that is unless my math is incorrect, but I‚Äôm pretty certain 1966 to 2024 is around a third the length of time you communicated.
You see, intoxicated dragonball person, it‚Äôs clear you didn‚Äôt read my post, which I invite you to do.
That quote is critcal because it‚Äôs easily seen next to the image of a rooster; even a speed reader would have taken notice.
This communicates you did not bother to educate yourself on my perspective.
Hell, if you had, you‚Äôd have seen I also said this:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to compare this party to other parties. I just need to look at this party‚Äôs actions to know who they are.‚Äù
Your argument operates under the presumption that one should put blinders on. Then they can ignore the actions of one group while focusing wholly on another. That‚Äôs a fallacious mindset, and I‚Äôm being courteous.
You also seem to be under the perspective I do not hold the Republican party accountable for their actions as well. and likely would be surprised to learn that I do.
One such example is that when the Republican party was founded and Lincoln ran for office, he was not on the ballot in several states at all.
This fact is one of the issues which threw the country into war because many felt like we would be living in another oligarch and their home state was denied a voice.
I could continue, but you likely won‚Äôt read it anyway as you‚Äôve demonstrated with your reply.
This may seem odd, but I feel strongly that doing your best with spelling, grammar and artucalation of point is respect to your reader.
By extension, replying after educating yourself on what the person is saying is also respectful.
You‚Äôve shown me neither, I‚Äôve shown you both. Please rectify this if you wish to proceed with me.

Those with gender dysphoria already have the same rights as those who do not.
The implied lack of rights is pretend.
Biological males do not need access to female bathrooms.
Biological females do not need access to make bathrooms.
Affirming an identity based on a mental health disorder is immoral and unethical. Expecting society to do so, and to act in leu of medical professionals is worse.
The correct course of action is to add gender dysphoria to the ADA where a trans person can have reasonable accommodations.
We already do this socially for a wide variety of mental health disorders.
Those who are ill deserve compassion, and should not be propped up in a social movement where people who do not have such an illness pretend to have it just to get praise. That is truly disgusting and shameful.
For those who claim that homosexuality was also part of the DSM here is my rebuttal: Homosexuality has never required medical intervention to feel whole.

I‚Äôm a liberal, not a Republican, and I have no idea HOW the Republican side can be so patient with these people.
The obvious idiocy of more firearm laws, when the entire point of T2A is to have a civilian military force. (and when there‚Äôs not that many firearm deaths per year anyway, when you remove suicide and repeat criminal offenders‚Ä¶.both being results of a justice system which needs repair and a more constructive mental health system).
The obvious idiocy of ‚ÄòClimate Change‚Äô which focuses so heavily on weather patterns over a long period of time but ignores the overall environment of which climate is simply a part of.
The obvious idiocy of many of these social justice movements which are divisive in nature; pushing our focus on biological difference which shouldn‚Äôt matter and away from class differences where wealthy and corrupt people hold tyrannical power and need to be held accountable.
Now there‚Äôs the Palestine lie. An alleged ‚Äòcountry‚Äô which isn‚Äôt. Tells everyone it isn‚Äôt because the Ottoman Empire would have rectified that AND because their flag is literally Jordan‚Äôs without a star.
They‚Äôre just useful idiots who tout Marxism and justify human rights violations because genocide, disarming US citizens and other goals get them that much closer to expunging the free market.

Your reply is not based in rationality.
Islam began in 610 AD. Christianity began in 33 AD. Judaism began some time in 1,800 BC.
Israel existed as Israel during the Roman occupation. Rome chose to call the lands ‚ÄòPalestine‚Äô as a ‚Äòjoke‚Äô based on the old enemy of the Jews: Philistines.
The Philistines were an Aegean tribe who roamed and warred with neighboring countries and other tribes; basically pirates. They worshiped fish deities, such as Dagon. They were entirely eliminated as both a tribe and people long before the Roman occupation. Neither Philistines nor Palestinians exist. Not biologically. Not factually.
Roman Emperor Hadrian evicted all Jews from their own lands after the Bar Kochba revolt in 138 AD as a punishment.
The lands held by the Jews traded hands multiple times until 1517 when the Ottoman Empire controlled it.
After WW1 the Ottoman Empire conceded all lands in the area to the British Empire. At this time it was still not a country, but rather a piece of land that was basically barren and very few wanted to live on.
When part of the lands of Israel were given back to the Jews by their occupier, the British Empire, those who moved in asked the very people people who were on those lands to stay. Some did, some did not.
When an empire holds lands and chooses to be benevolent and reinstate a nation, that‚Äôs not theft.
You let me know when fish worshiping pirates that look like modern Greeks lay claim to lands they only built on to raze neighboring areas though.

*Mr. Kamera: ‚ÄúI understand where your coming from but if you check a teenagers phone when they are not there it will build distrust and damage the relationship, plus it will cause them to find reasons to get away from the parents.‚Äù
*Answer: This is known as a strawman as it presents an argument not implied, inferred or otherwise stated in either the main post or mine.
What is that premise? ‚ÄúWhen they are not there.‚Äù
The only one who said anything about the child not being present when the phone is checked is you.
Since you brought it up though, let‚Äôs discuss that for a moment.
Is being sneaky an action which teaches accountability or deception?
Now, does expecting a child to openly meet agreed upon standards teach accountability or deception?
The difference is pretty clear here.
*Mr. Kamera: ‚ÄúThe best thing to do is to teach teens to stay away from people like these weirdo and not to trust someone on the internet who gives links or asks to meet in person, unless they are a friend from school.‚Äù
*Answer: This is not only the ‚Äòbest‚Äô thing, it‚Äôs a necessary thing.
Expecting accountability to maintain the privilege of their own phone or computer at 13 years of age where ‚Äògood‚Äô builds trust and ‚Äòbad‚Äô takes it away teaches a plethora of valuable lessons and is an equally necessary component of the above.
*Mr. Kamera: ‚ÄúShow them to consequences of what happens when you meet with random people online they are teenagers they will listen to their parents and they have common sense and care about their own safety.‚Äù
*Answer: The consequences are that they lose their phone/computer and are grounded if they operate outside the boundaries of trust and parental consent.
This is the best outcome because the alternative is abduction, sexual assault/rape, and if they‚Äôre not lucky enough to get away, their demise.
*Mr. Kamera: ‚ÄúEven better install a website blocker on the phone to stop them from going to doggy sites as well.‚Äù
*Answer: Logically a ‚Äòdoggy‚Äô site is family friendly unless it‚Äôs bestiality or an extreme BDSM variant of ‚Äòpet play‚Äô which would also be ‚Äòdodgy‚Äô for a 13 year old to view.
To that effect, I‚Äôm going to operate under the premise that you made a typo and meant ‚Äòdodgy‚Äô.
So we‚Äôre clear, If I were mocking you here, I‚Äôd point out the other typos you made. Instead I‚Äôm giving you my logical breakdown to translate what you said and how I interpreted it.
I believe installing a website blocker does not teach accountability nor does it not stop conversations which lead to these traps from happening on apps.
Teaching boundaries and then enforcing those boundaries does.
In the adult world, does the government install governors on cars so they can only go a certain speed or do they post signs and pull people over who don‚Äôt obey those limitations?
*Mr. Kamera: ‚ÄúYou don't need to be a parent to understand, you have people in their 30s who meet people online and have bad things happen to them.‚Äù
*Answer: The belief that people making poor decisions in their 30s is not at least somewhat a result of poor parenting that amazes me.
The above said, we‚Äôre discussing a 13 year old child here. A person who will likely not be able to even be employed without government (such as a local school system) permission. Here‚Äôs one such example Non-Agricultural Jobs - 14-15 and you‚Äôll notice it doesn‚Äôt even allow for a 13 year old.
***The post below can be considered a second one, related to the first, which demonstrates perspective.***
I‚Äôll be blunt and this section is going to be kind of long.
‚Äúdude just let her be its a part of life‚Äù
If you recall, I stated that I am not going to operate under the premise the person who wrote that is a predator/pedophile and instead, how did I put it?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a parent, and thus don‚Äôt understand the responsibility associated with that role.‚Äù
My statement is a very wide brush which applies to adults and minors.
There are certain times in life when you understand something on one side of the fence but don‚Äôt truly understand the other side until you‚Äôve been across.
Those experiences give you a lens to how the world really works versus those shielded from that reality.
Being a parent is one of those experiences.
A parent reads that sentence and sees a lot.
They see the concept of neglect by ‚Äòletting the child be‚Äô which is as bad in many cases as abuse itself from a legal perspective, by the way.
They also see ‚Äòlet her be‚Äô means she wouldn‚Äôt have a device she neither paid for, nor maintains the services of in the first place, because that‚Äôs not a right, it‚Äôs a privilege/reward given by a guardian.
They see a statement of immaturity which has dire consequences.
If you look at my profile, you‚Äôll see my history in emergency medicine. There were a lot defining moments in my life, of course, which led me to becoming a responsible adult but the cold reality of being responsible for another person‚Äôs life hit me when I had to ‚Äòtake‚Äô lives.
You see, in most of the known world, humanity has built a civilization where only a minority of the population are put in the position of even being presented with such a decision. A list of who those people are isn‚Äôt relevant to my experience, which I‚Äôll share.
My ambulance was the first on scene to a train wreck and I automatically became the ‚Äòincident commander‚Äô via protocol.
What this meant was that I was in charge of the entire scene.
The decisions I had to make that day were related to how many ambulances and other workers we had and obviously the goal was to save as many lives as possible.
If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with triage we use colors done by tags or sharpie.
Green: Don‚Äôt need our attention. Please go see a doctor on your own.
Yellow: Need our attention, but it can wait.
Red: Need our attention, it cannot wait.
Black: Dead and/or dying.
Looking into someone‚Äôs eyes, knowing there aren‚Äôt enough resources to save them, and marking them with a black tag is an experience I do not wish upon anyone.
It‚Äôs also the ‚Äòother side‚Äô of that fence between innocence and maturity as related to someone else‚Äôs lives being in your hands.
Now you might be thinking: ‚ÄúWait, that‚Äôs not taking a life. They were going to die anyway.‚Äù
No, sir, this is a choice between allocating a lot of resources to ‚Äòmaybe‚Äô saving one life or allocating those resources to ‚Äòlikely‚Äô saving multiple lives‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs after you‚Äôve assessed them and made a decision who those people are.
A person might be able to try to empathize how that position might feel, but until you‚Äôve been there and have to live with it, you can‚Äôt truly understand.
I know this because I couldn‚Äôt.
So it is the same with raising children. You‚Äôre responsible for the adults they become and their decisions as adults are in some manner a reflection on how well you raise them. How you will be judged is based on the tools you‚Äôve given them just as much as putting a roof over their head, feeding them, clothing them, providing other critical needs and not abusing them.
So, no, Mr. Kamera, we are not in agreement because not only is your argument not in good faith, due to you presenting a strawman fallacy, but it‚Äôs one based on immaturity. I hold that same view for every single person who ‚Äòliked‚Äô both your and the other aforementioned post.
‚Ä¶and yes, one can be an adult and be immature in some aspects of life, as demonstrated above.

People oft forget.
Jew is a ethnicity.
Jew is a culture.
Jew is a religion.
There are Christian Jews.
There are Messianic Jews.
So, the original question was worded very poorly to begin with and should have been: ‚ÄúWhy do those who practice Judaism not recognize Jesus as the Messiah?‚Äù
Even then, that question only takes a 30 second Google search to get answered.

Is making flat vector art from a copyrighted image still considered copyright even if it is hard to distinguish from the original? This video shows a great example of just how much I'll change a photo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCFANzKXdRY
It is definitely copyright infringement, it is the definition of a derivative work. There is a remote possibility you would have a fair-use defense (limited situations where what would be a copyright violation is allowed due to various reasons). But in this case that does not seem like something that would work.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Several mental illnesses do not begin to show symptoms until early adulthood. What you should do is listen to her and take her to a psychiatrist. It may seem ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù to you, but it surely took some time of her keeping things to herself before she was willing and able to tell you. The sooner she gets help, the better, regardless of what the illness (if any) turns out to be.

I smashed the job interview but a candidate that did worse than me got the job and I didn't. How do I convince them they made the wrong choice?
First, how could you know how the other candidate did? Did someone tell you or did you have a reason to assume? Second, a job interview is like a race. In a race, the person that crosses the finish line first wins. Likewise, in a job interview, the person that gets the job wins. If you had truly done better in your interview you would have gotten the job. You didn‚Äôt, which means you need to improve your interview skills. Perhaps find someone more experienced than you that has done job interviews to do a mock interview with you to see if you actually are crushing it.

Never, NEVER, do not believe your child if she is calling for help. Just because she has not shown you symptoms does not mean that she is not suffering. Obviously she has been suffering for awhile and has realized how poor her health to now ask for help. I can guarantee it‚Äôs not ‚Äúall of a sudden.‚Äù To be honest, this question angers me because she is asking for help and you asked quora for help first instead of a health provider. My parents did the same thing to me. I encounter tons of stress from school because of my workload (all classes are APs, always bring home As‚Ä¶just because your daughter seems to be doing well does NOT mean she is). I begged my parents for help for months until they finally listened. I was on lexapro for a year and just changed to wellbutrin. Please listen to your c‚Ä¶

*trigger warning: self harm*
My mental health issues started when I was 13. I was too ashamed to tell my parents that it had gotten so bad that I was scratching off my skin and cutting my arms. I never showed any symptoms, my parents had no idea. I ended up having to tell them everything after being reported at school and it was hard but they supported me and that meant more to me than I could ever explain to you. If your daughter is telling you something is wrong and that she NEEDS help, you need to believe her. She's an adult now, I'm sure if you won't support her, she'll find other people who will. Don't ruin your relationship with her, be there for her.

Do you specialize in BPD? One, you couldn‚Äôt because I suffer from BPD and I have never heard half of the shit you put on here. And I have had a lot of therapy.
I DO NOT HAVE NOR have I ever had another person in my life as a soulmate that MIRRORED myself. I have acted like a psychopath due to the fact that (A) I TRUST THE WRONG PEOPLE (B) It really hurts when another person betrays you that you thought loved you. I could go on and on but hopefully you get the point. About the bat-shit CRAZY things we dream up??? Like, wanting to be loved? who doesn‚Äôt. Wanting to trust others no matter how many times OUR hearts have been broken and we‚Äôve been left by others who were WARNED BEFOREHAND of our diagnosis? ??????

Can you explain why it's hard to explain your mental condition to other people when they doubt it's real?
It‚Äôs hard because people don‚Äôt understand how someone could be as messed up as we are!! They think either we‚Äôre exaggerating or using it as a crutch. I don‚Äôt use mine as a crutch, I use my diagnosis as a tool to help me figure out why I act the way I do, how I can improve myself and if anything, get the expertise of a mental health professional! i don‚Äôt live in the same world as others. My world is in my mind, it never stops. I live off feelings, instead of reality. I don‚Äôt think before I jump, I‚Äôve suffered so many consequences from my actions! and keep thinking someone is going to love me and never leave. Yes, it‚Äôs ridiculous!

Get therapy from a therapist who actually has BPD AND specializes in it bc if you don‚Äôt, they will not give you the advice you deserve nor will they understand what‚Äôs going on! Also, make sure you have a psychiatrist and a counselor.

RUDE‚Äî I‚Äôm pretty damn sure AMY wouldn‚Äôt want her children to suffer from anything like this! Who the f*ck would??? We are ALL worried about the children and their future, unless you‚Äôre a psychopath! And pretty sure, AMY didn‚Äôt know she had BPD before she had children or knew maybe what was wrong with her OR that she‚Äôd be splitting on her children! At least she‚Äôs aware and in ‚Äútherapy‚Äù TRYING! I‚Äôm SURE ‚ÄúHER CHILDREN‚Äù are the foremost reason she‚Äôs in therapy!!!
I mean, Do any of us realize until we‚Äôre older that we need such detrimental help before having children? unless we‚Äôre 50 years old having children, by then, I‚Äôd hope someone would understand there‚Äôs something very wrong! Get real‚Ä¶
How wonderfully funny you are to make such an ignorant comment like that? I‚Äôm honestly offended by every comment made by people who ‚Äúthink‚Äù they know nothing but EVERYTHING about what we go through and how much, I pray, MOST BPD parents want more for their children than a fuck*d up life as ours was and a mind that we want so badly to work right, but just doesn‚Äôt!
I‚Äôm POSITIVE you have things wrong with you because EVERYONE does, it‚Äôs just we do ‚Äúrealize‚Äù ours and the ones that do have a damn heart, would gladly lay it down for their children! There‚Äôs no pity wanted, some went through worse things and they‚Äôre called narcissists. They went through the WORST HELL‚Äî I dated one that was raped at age 5 years old! Surely I didn‚Äôt stay with him but dang, people can‚Äôt help how they were abused- they can only get the best help that‚Äôs available for themselves and their families, so lay off and go troll somewhere else!!!!

If I discard someone, there‚Äôs not ever a chance at going back to them. Because if I discarded you, there was a couple of reasons, not just one. I had boyfriends that drank too much, were needy (even at over 40 years old), liars, cheaters, manipulators and others that were just outright assholes, only thinking about themselves. I‚Äôm a nice person, I give and I expect mutual respect in a relationship‚Äîuntil I‚Äôve had enough or my KNOWN my boundaries TO THEM have been crossed. And believe me, I feel like it takes a lot to piss me off to an extreme where I act like a psychopath & to actually end a relationship.
I am very honest with men I‚Äôve been serious enough about that I‚Äôve dated concerning what I have and how I‚Äôm not going to put up with certain things! They just don‚Äôt seem to listen or care, at the moment! But, they do afterwards. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôm completely ignorant acting and in full blown crazy mode. Or I just ghost them bc they‚Äôre just not worthy of another word from my mouth. That‚Äôs the men that don‚Äôt EVER have a chance with me anymore. But,
IF I ever do go back, or think about it, I will give them more chances than they give me to reconcile. That‚Äôs the ones I actually saw a human being in them somewhere. And I have went back as the one who I wanted to talk things out and were maybe worth my time. But they are definitely treading on thin ice for the longest. And 99% afterwards, they end up making me cold as ice & I‚Äôm not in love with them anymore, the hurt was too deep but I linger on with them hoping my love will come back, but most all of the time, it‚Äôs gone. I hate that about myself but then again, they were

The POSITIVES FROM ROBERT ON BPD‚Ä¶.and my answer to his ridiculous statements!
Robert it is very sad that you spend all of your time blaming BPD people for your mental misery in life. Seems to me you may have been shafted by one and you reflect that every time I read your idiotic statements about people with BPD. Me being one of those people! It‚Äôs honestly laughable that you THINK you know everything about others with this diagnosis. When actually you need to educate yourself a little more than whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to prove in your posts. Saying that WE don‚Äôt have a heart, no rules or a conscious to go with it! That‚Äôs absolutely absurd. You‚Äôre going to regret one day that you have spoken so ignorantly about so many people. WE live in hell every day of our lives and STILL choose to love and believe that someone can love us back. WTH is wrong with this? And WTH is wrong with you?????

Are there any positives to having Borderline Personality Disorder?
Who wouldn't want to be a Psychopath of Love? Wouldn't you like to be fearless, highly resistant to stress and pain, filled with insane energy, able to ignore the opinions of others, and twist them around your little finger, less a human being, more a force of nature ‚Äî as long as your eyes are set on your beloved? Once borderlines give up their addiction to fake and phony affection ‚Äî look out! Robert

There‚Äôs no way for me to know if my boyfriend of almost 3 years is a narcissist, but I‚Äôm pretty certain he is. Every time I leave, I can‚Äôt breathe. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt live without him. He can not talk about his true feelings. It‚Äôs very sad and frustrating. I have BPD and an empath. I have just now opened my eyes. THIS you wrote, was absolutely amazing! Thank you!!!!

I hate I‚Äôm this way and I don‚Äôt know if anything will change. It‚Äôs heart wrenching. Thank you for sharing this video and information. I‚Äôve never heard this about myself , even from any of my psychiatrists nor counselors and it‚Äôs tragically true. No man has ever cared enough to figure out what to say to me when I‚Äôm out of control. Thank you for sharing that! I had one boyfriend ask what he‚Äôs to do or say when I‚Äôm like that and I couldn‚Äôt even tell him. I go into relationships truthfully telling them what I‚Äôve got. But it just doesn‚Äôt work out in the end. I feel doomed and I feel that for my partner. It‚Äôs a never ending cycle. Again‚Äî thank you!!

What are your thoughts on psychologists who don't have any mental health issues themselves? Do you think it's possible for them to be effective in their field? If so, how can they avoid becoming too detached from their patients?
My thought is pretty straightforward, if they don‚Äôt have any mental health issues of their own-I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for them to be an effective psychologist! If you‚Äôve never experienced mental illness yourself, there‚Äôs no way in hell you can understand nor relate to your patient‚Äôs psychological needs. Especially when diagnosing and treating them with the correct medications.
let me put it like this, if you‚Äôre not a parent, there‚Äôs nothing you can understand about the unconditional love you have for another human being nor how to take care of your own child in a maternal nurturing way. You won‚Äôt understand why people are so crazy over their children. But once you have one, you‚Äôre like , OH OK I GET IT NOW!!
of course, I‚Äôm referring to people with souls, not narcissistic people!!

How can being gaslighted affect a person's self-esteem and mental health?
i know for me, it made me feel completely defeated and why even bother replying to anything or asking a question. Even a conversation with a narc turns into them asking you why you did this like that or why did you react that way, just to tear you down then and later! They keep conversations in their heads of everything you‚Äôve said or done for later purposes. My mental health wasn‚Äôt great to begin with, after only 2 1/2 years with my boyfriend I was more depressed, not sure of myself nor did I even want to talk to him because EVERYTHING was turned around in the moment or later! It is an unconscious game of gaslighting! They don‚Äôt even realize their actions because to them, they do no wrong. It‚Äôs gut wrenching especially when you think you‚Äôre mentally capable of what you said or did. Nothin‚Ä¶

But maybe, just maybe, there doesn't have to be a point. You can just try to make the best of life. Even if it's hard now and seems like it's never gonna change, you might be surprised.

Also, talk to someone not only on the internet. It's really important, it can really change everything (for the better!).

I'm 33 years old and I never left my home city. Is this normal?
Honestly I can't tell because I come from a small country. But I don't think it matters what's normal and what isn't. You are you and you are different from other people period.
If you want to leave your home city, go ahead.
But don't do it because of other people's judgement or criticism. Then again, nor do you have to listen to what I or other people here have to say.
Just do whatever YOU want, and don't let people get under your skin.

I know this is like a couple of years late, and I hope you're better now. But if you're not, I know everyone says that, but you're not alone. Seriously, so many people (including myself) feel like that. In my case, I might have people in my life, but they aren't really here to listen. I don't know if it gets better ‚Äî hell, I hope it does. But even if it doesn't, in at the end of the a day only you can help yourself. If you can't, nobody else can. So try to make the best of life and every moment of it, instead of wasting it, like I do. Try to look at the glass half full, and if you can't, well, just do whatever you can and hope for the best.

I'm also autistic, but I generally think most of the time my parents don't understand me, regardless to autism. In my case, my parents don't understand me because they don't want to. I've told them countless times how I feel about different things, but even if they choose to listen, they don't *want* to listen. In other words, they simply do not care. My mom always goes about how my feelings are only feelings, and how I shouldn't let them bother me, as if they're unwanted or wrong, or something. But they are *my* feelings, why should I, or her, disregard them?
But of course, it's my problem and I'm at fault, as usual‚Ä¶

it doesn‚Äôt sound stalker-like don‚Äôt worry. you notice things like that with your s/o (like them being online and not talking to you) and then once you do it bothers you so you notice more and more?
i would say bring it up. maybe not in an accusatory way? instead of asking if he‚Äôs talking to someone, bring it up in passing like ‚Äúi noticed you up late one night? have you been having trouble sleeping?‚Äù and see how he reacts, then base how you go forward on that. just in case he is just doing other things. frame it positively. (idk if ya‚Äôll live together or not, but if you do that‚Äôs much easier to ask about, if not you could say you were also having trouble sleeping?) i sound so manipulative fjkdhsfj moving on.
i just think over time it will either lead to more distrust or like‚Ä¶ a lack of understanding and it‚Äôs better to figure it out, because trust is hard to rebuild and it‚Äôs really the foundation of a relationship. also, you feeling upset and paranoid is never good y‚Äôknow?

I think my boyfriend is talking to someone else. What do I do? I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs true or not.
it depends.
well first off, he should be able to talk to other women in a friendly manner.. but under the premise you mean romantically.
do you have a reason to think so?
maybe write down your reasons and then try and write down other possible situations that would result in those circumstances
ie: seems distant
-could be upset about something
-could be tired
if you think through it and still feel strongly about it talk to him.

How do I know if I am a transgender woman?
idk how much this will help but i remember when i was trying to figure myself out i saw someone online pose two questions
if you could become the gender (sex? idk which is the correct term for this analogy i saw it years ago) you want to be without any surgeries or coming out- just snapping your fingers- would you?
if you were going to live forever- would you transition? or could you live how you are currently.
this helped me realize my feelings about being trans because if it were easy or if i was going to have to live in this body forever- i knew what i‚Äôd do deep down.

to be fair, i‚Äôm an entp and i relate to almost all of this. except i will straight up tell someone exactly why they‚Äôve done something wrong and probably hit a few nerves along the way because it takes A LOT to get me upset. i can count the amount of people who‚Äôve genuinely pissed me off on like 1 hand.
i also make myself look pretty dumb because i don‚Äôt want to say i‚Äôm smart and then look dumb so i set the bar low and i think it kind of makes me more likable and i have a good circle of people as well.
i think what i consider scary (and what i‚Äôm very conscious of when i argue with a person) is i‚Äôm very bad with boundaries because i don‚Äôt personally have any and i‚Äôve accumulated so much information on the person that i could set off half the landmines in their brain, so like‚Ä¶ if i don‚Äôt hold myself back its bad. like without even thinking about it too much i will make a very valid argument about how someone‚Äôs ‚Äúcommitment issues stem from (specific childhood trauma) and maybe they should go to therapy for it because it‚Äôll probably help their next relationships‚Äù or something like that, and i don‚Äôt exactly MEAN poorly, but theres obvious room for negative interpretation

If I told you to jump off a cliff and tell you that you will land safely because there is a net you cannot see yet, would you blindly trust me and jump?
hell no.
i don‚Äôt know you at all, so there‚Äôs no way i could trust you. i don‚Äôt know your motives, fears, ect. i have no incentive to jump anyways? so i‚Äôd literally be possibly dying for nothing lmao

How do I earn hourglasses in Mystic Messenger?
-buy them
-play the game and they may show up in chats
-exchange hearts for hourglasses (100 hearts = 1hg)
-go to the guest list, click on a guest, hit rfa comment and for each guest you‚Äôll get an hourglass (this only works once the guest has came to your party? so you need to have completed a route to do it and finished their emails)

How did you come to know you needed to transition your legal gender?
you don‚Äôt decide to be trans. this is going to sound odd, but i would‚Äôve rather been a girl. i just know i can‚Äôt live as one or i‚Äôd be miserable because i am a guy (my body just didn‚Äôt match up with that until recently). there are a lot of parts that hurt with transitioning, like when i took t i basically lost my singing voice and had to start from scratch with my voice and i was worried my family felt ashamed of me, but it‚Äôs who i am and as much as i‚Äôd love to identify as a girl, i just know i couldn‚Äôt. it would be like?? putting a bug in a jar. or an animal in a cage. i would be stuck in a stupid cage. it probably sounds cheesy or something but coming out and being myself has allowed me to feel more comfortable with myself, almost like letting me out of that cage. it‚Äôs been kind of frighten‚Ä¶

Actually, I recently purchased a pair of boots worth ‚Ç¨270 and, to my surprise, I also got someone else‚Äôs order worth ‚Ç¨540 or something, on my name and address. I contacted them via email and they said I can keep the other products since it was their mistake. They said they already shipped the items again for the other customer. If they said I can keep the order, I will. I guess I got lucky.

We all do. I believe for SOME autistic ppl the thoughts are more often and/or intense. Or they do it due to possible social anxiety since they have problems with social cues. Or they just enjoy it. You can be a super organized person and do this as well.

Pffff I was bullied in school because of a similar reason. I love black pants. Period. Although I had around 6 different pairs of black pants, my peers still bullied me because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have clothes and I had to wear the same pair every single day‚Äù. Conclusion: wear what you want and let people talk. If they judge you based on something so mundane they‚Äôre idiots regardless of the reason why I wore the ‚Äúsame‚Äù pants everyday.

Hey. I believe it‚Äôs best for her to see a therapist. The therapist would be the judge of that. I do have certain issues as well and I didn‚Äôt even know about them until I went to see a therapist. Sometimes, people can mask their behaviors extremely well. Sometimes, people seem normal but they‚Äôre not. Sometimes, people seem normal and they are normal. You just never know. Either way, going to therapy doesn‚Äôt mean you have an issue. a disorder. You can see a psychologist even for issues like break ups or not knowing who you are, family problems etc. Good luck!

What do you do if nobody likes you nor wants to date you?
It depends on the type of personality you have, the situation you are in, and the ability to access finances.
Here's the thing, by the time you get there, if he/she hasn't noticed you by now, you more likely than not will be disappointed when you get there.

What should I do I am always emotional unavailable?
You have to give us a little more information, however, I assume you are talking about the relationship department?
If this is the case, and even if it isn't, you should probably ask yourself if you are emotionally uncomfortable or self conscious, shy, or just plain old lack of confidence?
Talk to a stranger first and work your way up, a therapist would be good, however, if that is not possible, then maybe the old lady on the corner, the bartender, your second cousin etc.
I am the same way and I found out that I just don't like to admit to my doubts, weaknesses, and failures.
Don't allow yourself to be surrounded by people and still be lonely.
You aren't required to share everything about yourself, just start with the basics.

Either A VERY SERIOUS CRY FOR HELP, Or maybe she is just nervous because her adult life will soon begin and she will have to make serious choices and decisions all by herself.

I‚Äôm sorry but are Are you a licensed psychologist? If no, then get your fucking daughter a therapist. Therapy isn‚Äôt just for people who have mental health problems either, that part is already stigmatized enough, let alone your daughters daughter‚Äôs age with those problems. You need to sit down with your daughter, have a one on one conversation with no belligerent attacks on her or her beliefs of what she‚Äôs suffering, but just talk to her and be a good mother. And if you still think nothing is wrong with her, still get her a therapist anyway. therapist. She is your daughter, no matter the age, and not believing her will wind you up as a mother who is hated for not understanding her child.

Should I (22, female) cut off my parents due to childhood emotional/physical abuse and them currently trying to control me if I move out?
I‚Äôm my opinion, if I were you, I would have cut them off the moment I turned 18 and moved out. But, since I am NOT you, I believe this is a decision that is solely up to you. You are a fully functioning adult, and cutting off your parents can be devastating, even though you know you need to for your own mental health. I encourage you to do what you feel is right, whether that be moving out and cutting off access, or whatever else you decide. I hope you found out what you need, and your parents realize they‚Äôre losing their daughter and regret their decisions. Best of luck to you.

How do I tell my dad and mom I think I have social anxiety? My dad has anxiety so I don't think it'd be too hard, but I am still scared.
I think you have more an advantage of expressing your feelings to your parents, especially your father for the very reason you mentioned, you both have anxiety. And it‚Äôs okay to be scared, but I severely doubt your parents will respond to you telling them by throwing you out of the house or yelling at you. Your father should be able to relate to your feelings of anxiousness, I know I do! I believe in you, your feelings matter to your parents, so go for it.

You knock and allow him to close his door. It‚Äôs that simple. You shouldn‚Äôt be inhibiting your son from having his own privacy and his own space. He‚Äôs a young adult who‚Äôs becoming more mature by the day. You should be lucky that he even has the decency to ask you to knock first! If you were in your room with the door closed, and your son just walked in on you, you wouldn‚Äôt be too thrilled now, would you? Respect must be earned by receiving respect, and you obviously have no respect for your son. Not sure if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs younger than you or your have more ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù, but your son has a life and privacy of his own, you need to come to your senses and realize that his privacy is one of the most important things to him when he‚Äôs at home, or anywhere he may go in life.

You are 100% a victim to a scammer. It‚Äôs a common trick people will pull to get you to feel as if you are responsible for this man you‚Äôve never met. They know the average person would try to do everything in their power to help those in need. Don‚Äôt fall for it, block the person on whatever you are contacting them on (Instagram, email, etc). Do not respond to any more of the scammers attempts to reel you in.

Motion Graphics by far. I did 15 years as a graphic designer capping out at 60k. I then switched to Motion Graphics (lot of training needs to happen) and my first job is $115k.
Besides the wild difference in pay, movement is just more fun. It‚Äôs taking static design and making it animate‚Äî-a level above. I absolutely love animating.
my 3 cents.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
What‚Äôs the issue with going and getting her checked out? If there is something wrong with her you‚Äôll know, conversely, if there isn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll also know.
Go see a professional and let them decide. You are a parent and protector‚Äîyes, technically she is an adult, but I can tell you that when I was 18, I may as well have been 16.
Be there for her.

A homeless person is likely to end up ruining your life‚Äîthey would probably squat, and squatter‚Äôs rights are very favorable to them and not you. Trust me, we had a homeless woman living in our trailer in another state and getting rid of her was an expensive, messy, process. She also DESTROYED our trailer rendering it worthless in the end.
if you want to be charitable, donate your time and money to shelters who have the infrastructure to deal with these helpless people; you do not.
hope this helps!

Is it probable that neither Johnny Depp nor Amber Heard is innocent and both are guilty of abusing the other?
It‚Äôs more than possible‚Äîits probable. They are both codependent and completely screwed up. They kind of deserve each other. This is what happens when you succumb to the lust of money‚Äîit always corrupts and destroys.

Disagree. As an 11-year old, a child is the property of the parents. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs such a thing as spying on your own child, that‚Äôs silly. It‚Äôs called being a concerned parent. This 11 year old already sounds as if he‚Äôs spoiled. Why does an 11-year old have a phone. I would, instead, revoke his/her privileged butt and take the phone away from them.
the parent has every right to keep tabs on their kids. They are, after all, the responsibility of those parents.

I believe Amber Heard is a victim, and Johnny Depp should not be given a retrial. What do you think?
I think they‚Äôre both completely co-dependent, and delusional. Heard is psychotic and fits the profile of someone who would self-harm in order to exact revenge.

She was probably too scared to talk to you about it before if she hasn't shown ‚Äúsymptoms.‚Äù I know, because that's exactly what happened with me. My dad was outraged that I was suddenly suicidal, and my mom started crying because ‚Äúmy baby wouldn't be depressed.‚Äù
Because I showed no signs of being depressed. The psychiatrist then sent me to emergency hospital, and told me I had symptoms of severe depression. Just listen to her for once, you won't regret it. Usually,.the mentally unhealthy ones are most likely the ones you would least expect.

If they love and trust you, then yes! My cat will usually be seen at the kitchen windows, and later on will meow and scratch the door when you're nearby. And when you're finally inside, he'll welcome you with purrs and he'll rub against your legs.

Should I tell my parents that I had an anxiety attack at school today?
I advise you to tell them and talk to them.
It might get really tricky if they don't talk to you really often. But it's alright talking to someone (anyone) you trust including your friends family members or maybe your favourite teacher. Talking to someone about how you feel will help you bit by bit.
if you have an uneasy feeling that bothers you everywhere, try asking your parents to go to a therapist after you talked to them truly how you feel.
If your parents don't understand you, it's ok. Because no one fully understands anyone even parents don't understand their children fully. So don't give up even after they don't understand you and try to talk to them everyday. It'll soon become a habit and your parents will be more curios to talk to you.
Hope this end up well and wishing you the best.

You should take her to the therapist. Just think about it, if there was nothing wrong with her mental health would she want to go to therapist? Many people don't notice they have mental health issues and let it grow inside their heart. I was one of them. I was living a great life but suddenly something happened to my family and i got sad for a month. And desided to leave it all behind and hid all of my sadness from my family and friends. They thought i was ok. I lived my life normaly but something was off. I started to act like i didn't mean to and did things that i didn't use to do. My family got worried and talked to me. I didn't know what happened but i just cried when they asked me what's wrong. It was so hard for me to pretend and lie to myself that i overcame my trauma. Brainwashing‚Ä¶

I yelled at my daughter while she was having a panic attack because she didn't want to go to the pool with me. Now she won't talk to me. Am I in the wrong and how can I fix this?
I don't know what really happened but It's not good to yell at someone eather he/she is having a panic attack or not. Because 1) Yelling at someone means you don't have control over your temper 2) Yelling is a root of anxiety. Also listen to your daughter. She needs someone who listens her and gives her a big hug and kisses if she wants. Maybe she was thinking ""i just don't want to go to pool. Why do i need to go there? I can't go there."" or something when you guys desided to go to pool. She just didn't understand why she was needed to go to pool when you can just go and have some fun and come back. A good advise for you is to not yell at someone anymore and give your daughter some space. When it's the right time have some chat. But don't force it if she doesn't want to talk to you about s‚Ä¶

Do you come from a family that uses the silent treatment as a punishment and if so how do you think it has affected you?
I'm 61 and my mom (d. 2015) used silent treatments (ST) as her primary form of punishment after I was too old or too big to spank, so probably around age 10. She never explained what I had done to anger her and there was no discussion afterwards. I could not predict whether the ST would last for an afternoon or for a week. I have been in psychotherapy for 12 years with a Jungian oriented therapist which involves understanding how I came to develop an anxiety disorder and how I came to rely on certain defenses. I will answer this as if I have not improved through therapy (I have!) Here's a bullet-pointed summary: 1. Since I didn't know what I had done wrong to provoke my mom, I tried to be perfect. Perfectionism has caused more harm than good in my life. It gave me academic success and made me‚Ä¶

Eighteen year-olds typically believe they‚Äôre invincible but more importantly, they want everyone else to believe they‚Äôre invincible. Just convincing a late adolescent/young adult to go to a primary care doctor for a minor health problem is like wrestling eels in canola. When an 18 year-old asks to see a therapist, pick up the phone yesterday and schedule her. As much as we moms like to think that we know our kids, the humbling truth is that at some time around puberty they close a few windows and build themselves a private room. Even extroverted kids who had always shared every detail begin keeping certain things to themselves. (This is developmentally appropriate and even necessary unless you want a thirty year-old living in your basement.) But sometimes they keep things to themselves that‚Ä¶

I have been working with a Jungian therapist both individually and in small group therapy for 11+ years. I used to think people who went to therapy long term were either extremely unwell or had a bad therapist.

I caught my 13-year-old son playing Roblox. I sent him to a boarding school and revoked his bed privileges. My family calls me insane. Am I a bad parent?
Your profile claims you're a father of 3 who graduated from Dartmouth in 2015. In one of your questions from 2 years ago you said you were 10 years old and another pegs you as 13 in '23. Maybe your profile is 100% fake. Maybe the profile is real but belongs to your dad and you enjoy trolling on it. Regardless, you are why Quora has become a cesspool instead of the great source of knowledge exchange that it used to be.

It's really interesting that a post-transplant face only vaguely resembles the donor. At most they look like they might be related, but the transplant procedure doesn't produce a look-alike and definitely not a ""clone."" Why not? For one, the recipient keeps their own eyes which are usually a major key to identity. Also, laying the donor's skin over the recipient's bone structure changes the appearance a lot. Recipients also either have their own teeth but if the teeth were destroyed, then implants or dentures are made to resemble the recipient's teeth, not the donor's.

Do I tell her I won‚Äôt walk her down the aisle as dad? How do I tell my daughter I find this tradition outdated? My daughter asked me to walk her down the aisle. We have a great relationship. I don‚Äôt own her, neither does her future husband.
I appreciate your views and agree that there is no ‚Äúownership‚Äù of a woman by her dad or her husband; however, your daughter‚Äôs wedding isn‚Äôt the time or place to dig in your heels to express your socio-ethical views. If I was in your shoes, I‚Äôd tell my daughter ‚ÄúAlthough I don‚Äôt own you and would rather not think of it as ‚Äògiving you away,‚Äô I‚Äôd be honored to escort you down the aisle.‚Äù Do you really care how others attending the wedding perceive the act? It is only important that your daughter feels your unconditional love as she takes a significant step in her life.

This is impossible to answer without knowing more about Dad‚Äôs usual temperament. Others have addressed the situation assuming dad is cruel, hateful and unloving. I‚Äôll cover a very different situation. I‚Äôm a ""feeler"" and my husband is a ""thinker."" (They say opposites attract!) He's an excellent, loving dad and our daughters adore him, but every so often his overly-logical mind makes him respond in ways that favor logic but lack empathy. I promise that he's clueless. I take him aside and let him know how our girls have interpreted him. He's genuinely shocked and feels terrible, and so he makes amends. I can't make things right‚Äîonly he can. A generic apology won't do; it requires acknowledging that he is aware that he hurt their feelings. No rationalizing or justifying, but an honest ""I screwed up. I've hurt you. I love you so much and wish I hadn't said/done that."" There's no drama. We all screw up and sometimes we parents act less mature than our kids.
If the dad in this question is a belittling jerk who cannot admit when he's wrong or thoughtless, then there will be many more problems to come.

Try to find the base unit to be certain your parents are responsible. Make sure it's not a little sibling being a brat. If you can't find the base unit, I wouldn't accuse your parents outright. I would tell them that you're really scared because you think someone has been spying on you and that maybe you should call the police? Give them a chance to either deny it or admit it.
On the other hand, if you found proof that they are guilty, I'd still approach them acting as if it never occurred to you that they could be the spies. Again tell them you're going to call the police and watch them squirm and try to explain. But, if you're very brave and your parents aren't dangerous psychopaths, then tell them that you already did call the police and they'll arrive in ten minutes.

I don't comment on Quora often but was notified of this question, I presume because I'm a retired pediatrician. The top comment from Moda Hardy offers excellent advice. I'd like to add a couple points. First, if this has been an issue for the boy's entire life (primary nocturnal enuresis), then it's extremely unlikely to have an underlying psychological cause. On the other hand, if he had been dry for a period of years and has only recently started to wet the bed (secondary nocturnal enuresis), then it is much more likely to have been triggered by trauma, abuse or another emotional issue.
If he hasn't been medically evaluated yet, this should be done. A pediatric urologist is the specialist to see if his primary care doctor isn't comfortable doing the work-up.
If he's determined to have the primary type without a medical cause, then it's true that time will ""cure"" him. That said, a medication called DDAVP (desmopressin) can be a godsend. Sometimes in older children, I've found that it seems to flip a switch. After a few months of treatment, some children can go off the med and remain dry. I had a daughter with this problem. Her primary pediatrician prescribed DDAVP when she was around 7 or 8 and within six months the problem was behind her for good.
Lastly, I want to reiterate that whether they admit it or not, all kids are deeply embarrassed by this problem. Adults must understand that it's NOT the child's fault and not under their control‚Äîat all. They need to hear this often! Wearing pull-ups is 100% appropriate, especially if they spend the night away from home (after Covid is behind us and they can socialize normally.
Good luck!

Thank you for looking into this. The ""questioner"" is clearly trolling for attention by asking questions he/she is certain will wildly stir emotions. Looking at the questions you've copied, first the person claims to be 14. Then, they have an 18-year-old daughter‚Ä¶and a gay son too? This discussion has been an interesting read, but there's no real parent behind this question.

I graduated high school in 1980 with a 4.0/4.0 GPA, and when I only managed a 3.85 in college, I felt like a failure. In no way have I pushed my two daughters to emulate my obsessive, compulsive academic performance. There is more to life than exceeding other people's expectations.
I've spent my life seeking approval from external measures. I felt okay about myself only when I achieved something that earned me a pat on the back. I want my daughters to feel comfortable in their own skin and to value themselves for who they are, not what other people think of them. At 21, my oldest daughter is absolutely kicking butt with a triple major in a tough field, but she once got a D in geometry. She was a gifted kid with a very specific disability in math. Her dad is a mathematician, and even so, we did not punish her. She felt cruddy enough without our help.
The OP is parenting his/her daughter using shame. I can look in the mirror and predict how things are going to turn out for the girl. She might be a successful adult as OP defines success, but she'll never feel ""good enough"" no matter how well she performs.
Is there ever a role for consequences for bad grades? Of course, but earning a 3.8 GPA with all As and a single B doesn't count. If you have a bright kid with no learning issues who's bringing home Cs, Ds and Fs because they refuse to complete assignments, blow off class, skip school, party, miss curfews and so on, then I stand behind your enforcing punishment.

How do I teach my 16-year-old daughter not to cry when I yell at her for doing something wrong?
Mom of 17- and 21-year old girls. Yelling is the immature loss of control of one's emotions because another person, in this case your daughter, is not conforming to your immediate expectations. I am embarrassed if I raise my voice, regardless of what bone-headed choice my kid has made. I'm the adult. I'm the one who models how to handle anger, frustration, failure, etc. If I raise my voice, I apologize‚Äînot for getting angry, but for behaving like an immature kid instead of an adult. Don't misunderstand me; I'm an older parent who's not permissive. There are consequences for bad choices, but my goal is not to make damned sure they know how pissed I am. The goal is to lead them to make better decisions next time. Punishment is pointless if it doesn't result in better choices, especially since‚Ä¶

I've never commented on Reddit before but I can't ignore this. My first thought was that this had to be a troll post, but I'm going to treat it as genuine.
I would really like to know why your daughter's pink hair strip has upset you so much? Are you worried about what others will think? Are you highly conservative and think other parents will assume your daughter is wild, or that you have ""lost control"" of her?
I have two daughters, 17 and 21. The oldest put a purple streak in her hair one summer. (Their Catholic high school doesn't allow hair dye so she waited for summer.) She was an excellent student, never missed a curfew, never got in trouble. She followed every rule, and I knew that she had needed to feel unrestrained in a harmless way. She didn't ask for permission because she didn't need to. I knew that if she suffered from negative judgment, she'd learn from the natural consequences of her choice.
Kids need to feel as if they can control some aspect of their lives, and I think this is even more the case for those who normally comply with rules. Pink hair is trivial. It's not heroin. It's not promiscuity. And it's temporary! I recommend apologizing, explaining whatever fear triggered your reaction, and then give her pink hair your blessing. This action on your part will do more good for your relationship with her than you can imagine. When a parent admits they were wrong, and admits that they were angry because of some underlying fear, a kid gains respect for the parent and witnesses how a mature adult behaves when they've made a mistake.

What's something your husband did to you that you will never forget?
I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant. I‚Äôm incredibly big and swollen. My feet look like fat sausages. I feel more unattractive than ever before. I weight more than I ever have including with my two other pregnancies. My kids are 17 and 13. Now I‚Äôm having a newborn. I‚Äôm super excited, but am so much older and more exhausted with this pregnancy. Do you know what unforgettable thing my husband did? He took my toenail polish off. He cut my toenails and then filed them the way I do. Then he trimmed the cuticles. To top it off he painted them for me. This is the picture of my toes afterwards. I didn‚Äôt even have to ask him. I was sitting down and could barely reach my toes when he said get up on the bed and I‚Äôll do your toes. He knows I didn‚Äôt want to spend the money on a professional pedicure and it‚Äôs important my toes don‚Äôt look too shabby for the delivery of our baby. Completely unforgettable. Picture from my phone of my very swollen foot. Edit: Thank you all for the sweet comments, he is a keeper. I just want to acknowledge that I am a medical professional or Nurse practitioner who was previously an OB nurse. I agree edema or leg swelling in pregnancy can be a warning sign of another complication including pre-eclampsia, or a blood clot. It can also be a normal part of pregnancy as increased blood flow and pressure from the uterus cause swelling. Signs and symptoms of a blood clot include redness, swelling and warmth especially if this is only present in one leg. In my case it is dependent edema. Or non concerning edema as my blood pressure is excellent and closely monitored due to my age. Edema can be treated with compression stockings, elevation, and increased water intake. Thank you all for reminding me to acknowledge the bigger picture of health and safety. Especially when it comes to maternal care as maternal mortality rates have increased and our greatest weapon to fight it is knowledge.

The answer to bathrooms. The corridors down either side are quite busy. The walls and doors of the stalls reach floor to ceiling. Nobody's necessary privacy is compromised. Nobody is in danger of being attacked. It does seem like a gigantic storm in a very tiny teacup.

My dad was 6'3"" and my mom is 5'2"". I'm 5'7"" male turning 18 in a few days. I feel my life is going to a dead end. Why will I never be tall like my father?
Height has nothing to do with potential in life! Look at Bruno Mars, he a little dude! It is never a dead end! Genuinely I used to be super self conscious about being short when I was in high-school and college(5‚Ä≤4‚Ä≥ I think). As time goes on and you gain more experience in real world situations, you realize height isn‚Äôt relevant really. Obviously there‚Äôs gonna be people who have specific preferences in height (potential significant others, NBA talent scouts maybe?), but a large majority of people are not going to pay much attention to how tall you are. Also!!!!! 5‚Ä≤7 isn‚Äôt that short at all! You‚Äôre gonna meet 45 year old men that are 5‚Ä≤2 and you‚Äôll realize this. I haven‚Äôt thought about my height in years now, and I actually have grown a few inches since then. TLDR: As you grow, you realize th‚Ä¶

My 15-year-old daughter is overweight. Is it too early to encourage her to start intermittent fasting?
Just in general, weight issues can be completely unrelated to food intake/exercise, thyroid and parathyroid issues are notorious for creating inconsistent weight gain/loss in children and young adults. In the situation where its not a thyroid issue, or something medically treatable, you must reflect on the habits that have been formed in your household. Maybe you could try to lead by example? Start making healthier meals for your ENTIRE family. It‚Äôs unfortunate to be this blunt, but realistically you raised this child, and you were responsible for its nutrition to an extent. At the age of 15, they don‚Äôt have THAT much freewill to go out and eat fast food constantly. I assume you and your partner (?) have been the one cooking for them predominantly, so then you are responsible here. Take so‚Ä¶

By saying that, you‚Äôre essentially contradicting yourself. the on the spot medical diagnosis that you‚Äôre providing just differs from the person you‚Äôre arguing with. You have no training in the fields which deals with mental illnesses, nor do you have the qualifications to be deciding OVER THE INTERNET what this absolute stranger‚Äôs best interest are for maintaining their issues. i‚Äôll tell you this for free, trying to use ‚Äòmotivation‚Äô when you‚Äôre clinically depressed can actually make things worse, but you wouldn‚Äôt know that because you‚Äôre not a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a doctor of any kind, you‚Äôre a security guard.

If you‚Äôre so depressed, why don‚Äôt you try and find happiness?
Answering with another question: what the hell were you thinking when you posted this?
There's millions of depressed people worldwide. Has it never crossed your mind that it isnt as simple as ‚Äúfinding happiness""?
‚ÄúHappiness‚Äù for us requires treatment + a healthy and stable environment (which is close to impossible in this pandemic), and sometimes that isnt enough. Theres a thousand variables on why someone is depressed.
Refrain from asking this kind of ridiculous question in the future, please. This is borderline offensive.

I don‚Äôt think even I know who I really am and I‚Äôve hidden it for so long - what‚Äôs wrong with me?
We live in a weird and violent world, with some grasps of glitter here and there. We carry heavy weights from the moment we‚Äôre born. It‚Äôs okay to not know who you are, to wonder about yourself, and there‚Äôs nothing really wrong with that.
What I can say is, take your time and seek professional help. Search for a therapist if you can. Talk to them, and talk a lot. With help, time and treatment, your identity shall become clearer.
Hope this helps. I never answered a Quora question. I hope you feel better soon.

I understand what you‚Äôre saying but you don‚Äôt know the situation well enough to know that it would destroy her life. The situation could turn out very well! Her siblings could welcome her with open arms. They might understand why the mother adopted her child out, and can comfort the mother. I do think they should discuss it between themselves, and she should try and find the reasoning for her bio mother‚Äôs request instead of going behind her back, as it could cause more issues like you were saying, but it‚Äôs not a typical situation where either A or B happens. It‚Äôs their personal situation that will differ because of it. Wishing you the best, and hope you‚Äôre staying safe during this pandemic!üíì

Mental health symptoms don't work the same way as physical injuries. Whereas with a severed leg, you can tell it was severed, on the account of it being visually severed. You can't read minds, so when someone tells you they're having mental health problems, THAT is the symptom. This is exactly why people hide their mental health problems. Because people like you who just blow them off and go ask the internet for reassurance that you're right, rather than talk to the person. Ironically, people like you are always the first to say ‚Äúwhy didn't they reach out to me?‚Äù when the worst outcome happens.

Hello there. I am a sufferer of stuffed animal addiction. Cuddly inaminite objects are a serious problem in the world, right up there with heroin. I'm a 27 man, and I overdosed and was hospitalized 3 times for being too godamn adorable when I hugged my teddy bear whom I named Jerry Cuddlesworth. Guys, it's a serious problem we have to address at a young age because owning stuffed animals somehow affects other people negatively.

I have ADHD-C. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until 22 and am now 27. I had a psychiatrist tell me that research shows that those with ADHD don‚Äôt catch up developmentally (maturity wise, etc.) until their late 20s/early 30s.
I always thought there was something wrong with me because I felt‚Ä¶ so behind my peers in moving out, getting a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job, etc.. I didn‚Äôt permanently move out of my parents‚Äô place and become mostly financially independent (my parents let me stay on the family phone and Netflix plan lol) until 26. I have some comorbid mental health issues, which didn‚Äôt help.
It definitely takes therapy. Meds help, too, if you choose that route.

Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle is literally one of my favorite movies. My friend and I got Calcifer tattoos on our calves. It‚Äôs the scene with him hanging onto the log over a dying fire saying, ‚ÄúMay all your bacon burn.‚Äù One of my favorite tattoos of mine.

My daughter is 15 watching cartoons. How can I tell her it‚Äôs for little kids? She said she misses her childhood.
I‚Äôm 26 and will still pull up Fairly Odd Parents or Spongebob sometimes. If I want to overdose on nostalgia, I‚Äôll watch the original Magic School Bus or Bill Nye the Science Guy. I watch anime often, and depending on the content of the show, could be considered ‚Äúfor kids‚Äù. Hell, my dad is almost 52 and has been watching anime his whole life. So what if she watches cartoons? Don‚Äôt shame her. Just let her enjoy what she‚Äôs watching.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Please listen to her. My mom didn‚Äôt know a goddamn thing until I broke down and showed her what I‚Äôd done to my skin just to survive the mental hell I was experiencing. Ten years down the line, I‚Äôm not dead. Statistically speaking, I should‚Äôve been dead before 20. A parent that listened contributed to my survival. If someone wants to hide it, they usually can. If she‚Äôs coming to you for help, she‚Äôs trusting you and opening herself up to vulnerability by being honest.

I have been diagnosed with PTSD as a result of some childhood experiences. I don't often remember these nightmares. I often wake up shaking with an upset stomach and a headache. Sometimes sweating. I assume it's some kind of coping mechanism, but I'm getting frustrated with it kicking up again.

Is a psychiatrist or a psychologist truly the best to diagnose a personality disorder?
A psychologist would probably be the one to diagnose a personality disorder. It‚Äôs more likely to discover something like that through therapy. If a psychiatrist suspects a personality disorder, they‚Äôd probably refer to a psychologist to clarify. Medication has very limited success with PDs. In general, according to professors in my psychology classes, psychologists do more of the diagnosing. They then refer to psychiatrists if medication is needed. Example: When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, my psychologist and psychiatric NP at the time were working together. My psychologist suspected bipolar II and spoke to the NP about it. When I was rediagnosed bipolar I about a year later, the NP was able to do that because I was clearly manic rather than hypomanic. When I was diagnosed borderl‚Ä¶

Can a person with mental issues become a psychiatrist or a psychologist?
It‚Äôs actually quite common. Many people that go into mental health care have a mental health disorder themselves, or have been a caretaker for someone with a MH disorder. A previous psychologist of mine admitted that many psychologists don‚Äôt take proper care of themselves mentally, and a psychologist I had in a group openly spoke of seeing a psychologist herself. You can see some of the behaviors yourself if you pay attention.
I‚Äôm also a clinical psych student with bipolar disorder, ADHD (predominantly inattentive), BPD, conversion disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.

Would a general practitioner know how to treat panic/anxiety disorder, or would they refer you to a specialist?
They could likely diagnose, or tentatively diagnose, the disorder, and if severe enough, give medication as a temporary relief while you‚Äôre waiting to see a specialist (was the case for me), but they‚Äôll refer you out to psychologist and/or psychiatry. Anxiety can be treated without meds; therefore, the referral may initially be to psychology. Some docs, however, have both an MD and PsyD, and may be able to do both therapy and meds.

What does it feel like to have borderline personality disorder?
Honestly, it‚Äôs different for each borderline, but there are some common things reported. Also depends on comorbid disorders. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ strange, somewhat hard to explain. The best way I can think to describe it is feeling EVERYTHING 1000-fold. Emotions, touch, vision, hearing. They say ‚ÄúWearing your heart on your sleeve‚Äù as a negative thing, but I‚Äôll use it here as a neutral descriptor to hopefully make it easier to understand. I, personally, feel emotions more intensely, and I‚Äôm more susceptible to criticisms that might normally go unnoticed or may not mean much. I hold on to it, I don‚Äôt forget it. That can be a good thing‚Ä¶ if you can do it without holding a grudge against yourself (or others; I‚Äôm better at the latter than the former).

What are the triggers to borderline personality disorder?
1) Somewhat stereotypically, feeling like I‚Äôve been ignored or like I‚Äôm just not being listened to. My poor SO has run across this when I‚Äôve said something a few times, and he just doesn‚Äôt hear me (he has severe ADHD), or is too engrossed in what he‚Äôs doing.

In what ways are people with borderline personalities sometimes dangerous?
As a clarifying statement: not all Borderlines are dangerous. I am diagnosed BPD, and more so than anything else, I am a danger to myself.

Borderlines‚Ä¶ we can be an emotional drain at times, especially on those we may mark as our ‚ÄúFavorite Person (FP)‚Äù.

How many nights of sleep deprivation does a bipolar have before going into a mania?
[Speaking as a rapid cycling BPI patient] Sleeplessness, decreased need for sleep, etc. is typically a symptom of mania; however, change in routine (i.e. sleepless nights, diet, death of a loved one, change in clinician, etc) can and normally will trigger mania/general mood cycling in some bipolar patients. If, for example, the patient is hypomanic and sleeping less, that may disturb the sleep schedule and pull a patient up into mania. There is, however, no specific answer. Each bipolar patient is different and will respond to lack of sleep as a potential trigger differently. Lack of sleep may trigger a mixed or depressive episode rather than a manic episode. Clinical psychology as a whole is very difficult due to the unpredictability and case-by-case basis of treatment. The same applies here.‚Ä¶

I always take my neighbours mail so I can review it. I put back the good mail and burn the bad mail. Is this the right thing to do?
it is not only illegal to open mail that isn't yours, but also an offence to simply keep or unduly delay the receipt of that mail. That means that not only is it an offence to open someone else's mail, but the simple act of discarding that mail is also a crime.

If you push someone who can't swim into a pool, can you face charges?
It would depend on whether you intended to do bodily harm, ie you knew they couldn‚Äôt swim but pushed them anyway. On the other hand, if you didn‚Äôt know they were unable to swim then no because they have put themselves in danger by standing next to a pool they knew they could drown in. It‚Äôs their responsibility to not put themselves in danger.

My neighbours went out for lunch and I broke into their home to burgle them. I was horrified to find children's skeletons in the closet. What should I do? I don't want to get in trouble for burglary.
If you‚Äôre truly sorry be responsible, confess the crime & tell what you saw. I highly doubt the police will care about your break in if they find remains of children. If you can‚Äôt do that, then most police agencies have anonymous tip lines so give police the information. And stop breaking the law, it‚Äôs only going to end badly if you continue down that path.

I accidentally left a bag of tools at a customer's house. They are refusing to let me come get them and are claiming it is now their property. What are my options?
Make a flyer with a photo of their home & all their information. Title it: Looking for stolen property. Then put the entire story on it. Now attach a sticky note that says, either you return all of my tools within 24 hours or I‚Äôm going to do a public service by distributing this flyer to all the homes in a 20 block radius of your own and to every business that does repair work in this city, in order to prevent them from having their tools stolen during a service call. Then I will post this all over social media to ensure no one else falls victim tool theft. Since you have paperwork to prove you were there fixing an issue with those tools, it‚Äôs not slanderous.

Go to the police to have a case started so you will have a case number. Then go to the city water metering agency with your video & the police case number. This is outright theft if you pay for your water. The city can review your previous year‚Äôs records and reduce your water bill accordingly and then they can sue the thief for the difference.

Sometimes when we book flights, it‚Äôs hard to find a couple of seats together. My husband has had to choose a window for me and the isle for him and when we get on the plane, we ask if the centre seat would mind switching to the window or isle so we could sit next to each other. The reverse has happened to my husband when he travels alone for business, being asked to switch so a couple /family could sit together and he has tried to be accommodating when possible.
I don‚Äôt see the harm in asking because some people don‚Äôt truly care where they sit, not every seat has been ‚Äòpaid for‚Äô however if you have chosen your seat for a reason you can just simply & politely say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I picked this seat for a reason and I prefer not to change‚Äù. No harm no foul.
I don‚Äôt think the asker should be labeled as ‚Äòentitled‚Äô they simply got stuck in a position where they couldn‚Äôt get two seats together (maybe had to book last minute to attend to a loved one or perhaps a funeral) so they simply asked a question. On the other side of that, if she acted rude or belligerent, than she was being ‚Äòentitled‚Äô but there is a difference between being mad and being disappointed and I would hope she was just being the later.

I prefer that my tenant pays the rent with a written check. He wants to pay me with cash. What should I do?
Your tenant is entitled to pay their rent in any negotiable instrument; money order, check, direct deposit etc. Perhaps he doesn‚Äôt trust banks and doesn‚Äôt have a bank account. If you‚Äôre concerned about your safety and having cash at your home or on your person (I get it, I don‚Äôt carry any) arrange for them to deposit it directly at your bank and have them send you a photo of the deposit slip as proof of payment. You can arrange this with your bank to allow your tenant to make deposits only directly to your account.

My landlord is evicting me because I'm 2 years late on rent. How do I tell him I'm not leaving no matter what?
Does it even cross your mind that your landlord has to pay the mortgage on the home you live in, even when you don‚Äôt bother to pay your rent? Why do you think the landlord should pay your living expenses as well as theirs? Could you afford to pay two rents per month? That‚Äôs what the landlord has to do, pay their mortgage payment as well as the one on your home. When I was diagnosed, we bought a home with our savings to generate a rental income to try & recover ‚Äòsome‚Äô of my lost wages for having to be medically retired. My disability pension is about 1/3 of what my income used to be.

I absolutely do not advocate for stealing however, it frustrates me to no end that big box stores cut their operating costs by cutting employees & the put in self-checkouts so that we can be their free checkout labour, then don‚Äôt trust us to pay for everything so they put a watchdog at the door to bottle-neck & harass shoppers. If they want to make sure that everything is rung through, then they should hire an employee, train them and then put them to work making sure that everything gets paid for!!
Dear Big Box Stores & stores that have self checkouts.
You are heading towards almost exclusively self-checkout now.
The lady checking receipts at the exit was stopping everyone.
I didn't choose to participate in that nonsense, I had already
üõífilled my cart
üõíemptied my cart
üõíscanned the items
üõírefilled my cart
and so I just skipped the exit line and left.
I heard her saying ""umm - Excuse me ‚Äú as I kept walking and raised the receipt above my head, leaving the store.
You can either trust me to do self-checkout, or you can put your cashiers back in place like it used to be.
‚Ä¢ I'm not interested in proving that I did your job for you.
‚Ä¢ If you want me to be a cashier with no training then that's your problem not mine.
‚Ä¢ Keep employing young people and give them job opportunities.
YOU DON'T PAY ME TO SCAN MY OWN SHOPPING.
YOU DON‚ÄôT GIVE ME STAFF DISCOUNT FOR WORKING FOR YOU.
Signed ......All of us
These are jobs that are needed to have for young and old ‚Ä¶..

My 18-year-old son left home with our authorization to get an apartment and now refuses to pay his daily parenting fees that he has been paying since he was 13 years old. How would I go about suing him?
He‚Äôs 18 therefore an adult & needs your permission no longer. Additionally, I think you‚Äôre confused because you were supposed to be paying him allowance not accepting money FROM him. How about you add up all those ‚Äòfees‚Äô you charged him and refund him as a house warming gift for his new place.

Is it okay if teens only wear panties around the house when their father is there?
I guess I‚Äôm confused about why anyone would wonder around without clothes? How many fathers & mothers hang around the house in their underwear? What if there was a fire? What if someone drops by? The least amount of clothing we were ever allowed to run around in was our pyjamas and that ended after breakfast was eaten. Everyone should be dressed when not in the bathroom or their bedroom. It has nothing to do with fathers/daughters, men/women etc. it‚Äôs about self-respect & consideration of others, it‚Äôs for the same reason we don‚Äôt go to school, the bank or church in bathing suits, it‚Äôs inappropriate.

I‚Äôm 18, and my parents are making me pay for my own room when it‚Äôs always been my room. How do I stop this?
Your parents are preparing you for the future. Nothing in life is free after 18 years old. Everything you eat, drink, where you sleep, what you wear & how you get there costs money.
My parents did this for me and it was an invaluable lesson. I knew the value of money, how to be responsible to pay my bills, how to budget and so much more. I congratulate your parents for preparing you for life. Appreciate the fact that room & board is so cheap, when you move out, your living expenses will be a minimum of $2500/month and that won‚Äôt include a car payment either, just the basics of housing, food, utilities, cellphone etc.

If police call someone and tell them they need to come down to the station to give a statement (witness or not), or for an interview can they just remain silent, hang up the phone, and just simply not show up at the police station at all?
You can, but why? If you saw something or maybe you don‚Äôt even realize you know something that could help put a criminal in jail why wouldn‚Äôt you? Rather than looking at it adversarially, why not go down and find out what it‚Äôs about first. If you don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs being said or you feel threatened then just say ‚ÄúLawyer‚Äù and that has to end the conversation.
We all hate when something is done to us or our property so why wouldn‚Äôt we try to help someone else.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
If she is saying that she is having a mental health issue, then she's definitely not lying. Just be there for her and support her. Be sure not to upset her with your doubts and questions. A person with depression or any kind of mental health issue usually masks themselves with ‚ÄúI'm fine‚Äù sign just to avoid annoying questions. She might try to open up but it would be hard for her. So be patient with her and show that you love her and will always be there for her, no matter what. And stop doubting and believe her.

I‚Äôm 23 and my GF is 14. I really love her, her one smile makes my day. Considering her age, I don't indulge in any physical activity but I really want her to be mine. What should I do?
As much as I want to help you man..this situation doesnt really call for any help. She's way too young and even if she's SERIOUS about it now..she's bound to change sooner or later. Keep in mind that she's still in her early teens, yet to enjoy high school or college or other romantic and sexual activities. Right now she's at least 4 to 5 years too soon for that. So..you shouldn't indulge with her anymore, in a romantic way.. in a relationship, it's for your own good and hers. If you ignore this advice, you're probably gonna be sued by her parents or someone, and no one would hear your testimony even if what you are saying is 200% legit. That's how it works. Good luck homie

TW When I was maybe 14, I began self harming. I can't explain what it was that made me do it, but I started cutting my arms and legs with a razor I'd stolen from art class. I had spent every day imagining drowning, I just didn't want to live any more. My mum didn't find the cutting ‚Äî a family friend noticed it. When she told my mum, she told me I was doing it for attention and to stop it. She took me to the doctor and demanded the doctor tell me to stop. Cut to 3 or 4 years later I was diagnosed with a Personality Disorder. You won't see these symptoms as this often comes about in childhood so it just looks like that is just the person your child has become.

I caught my 13-year-old son playing Roblox. I sent him to a boarding school and revoked his bed privileges. My family calls me insane. Am I a bad parent?
You are competing for the absolute worst parent award I see? Even some drugged out parents love their child more than you do. You sound evil and horrid. The boarding school is probably better for them, but you can never fix that abandonment. If you were going for most successful way to alienate a child, you may have won. Congrats. The fact you even have to ask and think you were at all right in this decision shows how terrible and cruel you are. I‚Äôm not your child and I hate you.

I‚Äôm going through horrible things in life. My family is putting me through unimaginable things. They‚Äôre putting me through horrible stuff to the point that I want to cut them off for good. Should I talk to a therapist about my anger?
Yes, I think so. If not a therapist, then someone close you can trust. Someone who will have your back.

we have a BAD flea infestation in the yard and house, but cannot get rid of them. We are unexpectedly out of money so we are unable to take him to a vet(long story that I won‚Äôt bore everyone with) after a very rough couple of weeks we have come to accept that we are unable to be the parents this puppy needs and have found him a good forever home before he becomes anymore attached to us. He deserves better, so we are giving him better. That being said, we have three days before his new owner comes to pick him up. I do not know what to do to ease his discomfort for the time being, and as I stated earlier we have no money to go to a vet. I‚Äôve only got three pennies left in my bank account. It‚Äôs been a rough go of it. I need help- how can I help him? What can I do to make him happier and healthier until his new owner can pick him up and take him to their vet?

I dyed my faded blue/greyish hair red but it has a tinge of purple/burgundy fuchsia now. My boss says I need to make it more red and get rid of the purple hue- until it is fixed I have to wear a wig to work. How do I make it a more ‚Äòpure‚Äô red?

These are 2 pics of before and 2 pics of it now in case that helps. I am not sure if you can really see the purple-ish hue in the red, it has a hard time showing in photos. I can sort of see the burgundy purple tinge my boss said is not okay but it is VERY faint. My manager said he will allow me to have red hair even if it‚Äôs unnatural, I just can‚Äôt have any hues of other colors like purple. I need it to be pure red (I think he is talking about the Ariel, the little mermaid kind of red?? He said brighter is acceptable?) he said to wash it to see if it gets brighter and I just did, but now it just faded ever so slightly into a more fuchsia color. I do not know what to do I‚Äôm order to make it acceptable in my manager/corporate eyes, so I can stop wearing a wig. All I know is I love the unique colors and want to make this work so I can still be ‚Äòme‚Äô so to speak and NOT have to wear a wig to go to work.

Why do people dye their hair? Why do they choose to do it with unnatural colors?
As someone with blue hair- because I enjoy it. I find dying my hair fun and seeing my blue hair makes me smile. It is how I express myself. I have had people on occasion say ‚ÄúI liked it better when you were blond‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy would you do that to your beautiful blonde hair?‚Äù but I would rather be me than another number in the crowd, simply for the sake of other‚Äôs opinions. If something makes you happy then why not?

We are trying to slowly introduce them to each other because the older one is not spayed yet and acts territorial, I don‚Äôt want them to fight or the older girl to attack the younger one. Should we hold off on letting them out with each other until we can get in with the vet to have them spayed?

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
You should listen to her. No one knows her better than herself. Mental illness can be an active part of someones life for years or it can come on randomly as they get older. I'm 20. I didn't have any signs of anxiety before, but in January I started having panic attacks and was so anxious that I didn't sleep for days because I was afraid I was going to die in my sleep. Listen to her. Get her help. If she's lying then you guys work through it. If she's not then you can be grateful she got the help she needed when she did.

There‚Äôs over 4 billion women on earth. ‚ÄúMost‚Äù is an false assertion to make. You haven‚Äôt met most. What are you really wondering about? Why the women you like aren‚Äôt interested in you? Maybe your idea of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù man is lacking. Maybe you are attracted to women who want something else. Maybe you‚Äôre not actually a ‚Äúgood‚Äù man & they see it. Maybe you are a ‚Äúgood‚Äù man but you‚Äôre attracted to women who don‚Äôt want that. If so, the real question is, ‚ÄúWhy are you attracted to women who don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúgood‚Äù man or don‚Äôt want you?‚Äù
Maybe the men they are attracted to present themselves as ‚Äúgood‚Äù until they get her stuck or invested & then they show their true colors.
And There are millions of stunted women and men in the world. They don‚Äôt even recognize it in themselves let alone others.

Ask her. it‚Äôs really that simple. ‚ÄúWhen I handed you your phone the other day i saw that text. What is that all about?‚Äù The same way you would broach something you‚Äôre concerned about with anyone. Listen to her and tell your concerns.
There are a lot minors (children) answering this post saying, ‚Äúit could be this or could be that.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably a joke‚Äù ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou need to respect your child‚Äôs privacy.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou need to trust them, leave them alone.‚Äù
These comments show emotional immaturity and Oversimplified understanding of life. If you are in a relationship with someone and something is concerning to you, you do not stuff it down and ignore it. You are an adult. You are a responsible for your child‚Äôs well-being and safety. You talk about your concerns with respect and care.

My therapist and I developed a codependent, enmeshed dynamic. She recently terminated my treatment abruptly and without explanation. I‚Äôm absolutely devastated. What can‚Äîwhat should‚ÄîI do? I don‚Äôt even have closure. I‚Äôm confused and heartbroken.
To your question of what should you do:
Find another therapist. Be forthcoming about your past therapy experience with your new therapist and be clear on where you are emotionally.
The speculation and blaming of your therapist by commenters, particularly those who are or claim to be therapists themselves or healers/coaches, is unhelpful to you moving forward and frankly unprofessional on their part. It may feel nice to have people vilifying your therapist now because you are hurt, however it isn‚Äôt actually useful in the long run for you as you try to move forward. We as commenters do not know the whole story and smear campaigns by commenters are red flags.
I wish you the best as you move forward.

If you have talked to her about the abuse your father inflicted on you and your fianc√© will not respect the boundaries you have for your safety and well being, this is a BIG red flag. Not respecting others boundaries and need for maintaining safety/self respect are symptoms of disordered character/personality traits in her. Please reflect on her and your relationship with her before you proceed further. Better to do it now, than years into a bad situation.

You can get free test from a crisis pregnancy center and they will also connect you to services that will help you with the cost of your pregnancy and baby, usually for two years. You will not be alone once you call them! They are there just to help new moms and are free, of course.

please do foster care first. This will help you know if parenting is for you and the child knows already its a temporary thing. Going back on an adoption is much more traumatic for a child.

This was common in the Us too until it became expected that all women work outside the home until they retire. My grandma stayed with us a minimum of three weeks after a baby came. But my mom was working so it was all up to me. I took as many days as I could given my job restrictions to help my daughter and daughter-in-law. No one values the work women did before we all became cogs in the economy.

Do you know the parent to whom you are entrusting the child? It might help if you know the person(s) well enough to know the child is going to a safe loving home. I know a person who obtained a child through surrogacy and as a result I strongly oppose the practice. but you can‚Äôt change your mind now‚Ä¶ the child is a reality so I would make sure the home is a loving one. Women have given children through adoption since time immemorial and done fine after the initial sorrow. You will be ok

Find her a therapist you like and trust. Meet with the therapist first and make sure she or he is solid and won‚Äôt create more problems than she or he solves. Then offer to pay for the counseling. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you believe her or not, the important thing is to let her know you take her seriously and are always there to help her. It‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs just feeling the normal ups and downs of reaching adulthood and a good therapist will help her realize that. It is also quite possible she is experiencing something much more serious and that needs to be handled very carefully. The worst thing you can do is dismiss her. She trusted you would help her‚Äîthis is your chance to build on that trust.

Should I move closer to my kids even though I'm happy where I am?
Yes. It's not about your happiness--when you became a father, you took on the responsibility to support and guide them through this life. Ideally, you will live so close that they can visit you whenever they want to, especially as they move into their teen years. Our society says a lot of dumb things like, ""Your kids won't be happy if you are unhappy"" and urges people to put themselves first in all things. But it is though self-sacrificing love and taking on responsibility that we find meaning and purpose in our lives, not in pursuing ""happiness.""

I think the whole idea of chirdren = happiness is flawed. Children bring a richness and depth to your life, but it is not without cost. Happiness is fleeting and self oriented. Do children make you happy? No, they make your life more intense, more meaningful, and the moments of joy in my life have almost always revolved around my children and grandchildren.

How can I learn to care about my children?
Adhna, you may be feeling prolonged post-partum depression. You may be on the autistic spectrum which affects how you connect, even to your own children. You must seek professional help to determine how to address this absence of feeling. In the meantime, ACT as if you love them, behave as if you care deeply, and this will help you, in time, connect and feel actual love. But most importantly, seek counseling to find the root cause of your detachment.

What should a parent do if his/her child is always wanting new things?
Don‚Äôt buy you child anything except on birthdays and Christmas. Instead, take him or her on outings, anywhere different or special. It doesn‚Äôt have to cost anything‚Äîride the bus to a park, play catch, anything that is different from your routine. You should also bring your child to your church every week and have some sort of treat afterwards, like a large family breakfast. Most churches also have free, child-oriented activities. Your child is looking for things things to make him or her feel good. You need to substitute family experiences that build love and a faith.affection and faith. If you don‚Äôt, your child will spend much of his or her life trying to fill that void with material stuff and will always feel empty.

I am not sure if I want to keep my unborn child with Down syndrome. I don‚Äôt think I can handle the extra care, emotion, and costs. Am I a monster?
Go to a Special Olympics Event anywhere and see the people. I think if you meet people with Downs like my son it will help you. My grandson has Type 1 diabetes and you know, caring for my son (his uncle) with Downs is a LOT easier. There were no additional ""costs"" with him, and the emotion was mostly joy, once we got used to the idea. Yes, he can be a pain, and a challenge, but what kid isn't? And you can, if you feel you must, give him to adoptive parents as there is a waiting list even for kids with Downs. But I have met many parents with kids with Downs and to a one, they love their son or daughter fiercely and have no regrets.

This is honestly a very dangerous way to paint an entire group of people. BPD patients overall are not violent criminals with court ordered therapy.
It honestly seems like you are one of the biased ones that brushes off the diagnosed based on lazy stereotypes and a few bad personal experiences. Ironic of you to answer a question about this type of mental health practitioner yet to not be able to recognise it.

Take your daughter to a therapist üòí if she feels she needs one then she probably needs one. Plain and simple.

I found out I have cancer‚ÄîI have not told my family. We can‚Äôt afford the treatment anyway. Should I just say nothing and let nature take its course?
May sound kind of ridiculous but tell your family. And if losing an income won‚Äôt hurt too bad, quit your job. Your lack of income could qualify you for Medicaid which then should cover most if not all of your treatments. But even if you don‚Äôt take that route tell your family. Because if for some reason your cancer becomes aggressive and past the point of treatable, you want your family to be able to mentally prepare for what may happen.

My 12 year old son is threatening to break his PS3 unless I buy him a brand new PS4. What should I do? Should I listen to him and buy him a new one?
Are you seriously gonna let your 12 year old run your life? Take the ps3, give it away to a child more deserving. And maybe he can get a ps4 when he learns how to act and appreciate the gifts given to him that aren‚Äôt requirements of childhood.

My fourteen year old daughter got a B on her report card for the second time. I told her the first time if it happened again, I would take away her phone for until next school year. Should I have done anything more?
I was very depressed in high school. I was a mostly straight a student and any time i got a ‚ÄúB‚Äù in a class, i lost phone privileges.the house phone because i didn‚Äôt have a cell phone. It actually caused me to focus less because me being able to use the phone allowed me to contact people to be able to vent if i was going through anything. Not being able to talk to someone for months didn‚Äôt make me try any harder in school. It made me feel like ‚Äúwhy bother?‚Äù I never saw the purpose behind punishing someone for getting a ‚ÄúB‚Äù

I‚Äôm the eldest of 3 brothers, late twenties. The youngest, late teens, messaged me earlier that afternoon. He hadn‚Äôt been able to get hold of our mother (early 50s) in a few days, and wanted to know if I or the middle brother had heard from her. We hadn‚Äôt. It sounds like hyperbole but I swear it‚Äôs true, I knew at that moment that she had died. We all lived in far flung places from our home town so nobody was able to go check, so the middle brother called the police and requested a welfare check. Cut to 11:30 that night.

You call the cops and tell your parents. If this person is online screenshot the messages and tell your parents immediately. If you know this person get somewhere safe and tell a trusted adult. Make sure you report him. He is a child predator and will eventually harm a teen or child. People like this can be charismatic and will try to make it sound like you are special and they want to take care of you this is not the case.

The answer is you don‚Äôt. She already knows religions point of view. Please keep in mind that many lgbtq individuals have attempted suicided due to conversion camps and unsupportive parents who tell them they are going to hell. Please remember not to judge you child but to love them. You do not have to approve of her lifestyle but as her parent there will be many things that you don‚Äôt approve of.

You should be supportive. She is an adult and did not need to inform you most likely she let you know because she need support. Just because you don‚Äôt believe there is a problem doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt. Most people would not make up having a mental health crisis.

I gave a BJ to my boyfriend and then we French kissed. Two days later, he went down on me. Would there be a chance of pregnancy?
No chance of pregnancy although I would be more concerned about stis and please stop engaging in any sexual activity until you both further educate yourselves. I am very concerned at either how young or naive you are. If you are a minor in most cases you should be able to access birth control without parental consent if this is a concern and be able to speak with a health care provider about any risk or concerns. Not trying to sound rude but this is exactly how young kids get stis or end up with a baby lack of education. Please look into women‚Äôs clinics near you.

BELIEVE HER. I don‚Äôt know why this is so hard to understand for a lot of parents. Mental illness can have a whole concoction of symptoms. And judging by your comment I can see why she wouldn‚Äôt show them to you. She obviously doesn‚Äôt feel safe enough to confide to you about how she really feels because you are undermining her. ALWAYS BELIEVE someone when they have the COURAGE to come to you about their struggles. This is so damaging and can lead to much worse.

My 11-year-old, 6th grade daughter won't let me go through her new iPhone 11. I then found out that she changed her password. I told her to change it back, but she refused to. What do I do?
First off, this is a huge invasion of privacy, she‚Äôs a growing girl and needs her privacy, this will develop a bond of trust between the two of you. Educate her on how to safely navigate the internet instead of forcing your ‚Äúprotection‚Äù on her, I would understand restricting her from using social media until she‚Äôs about 13, (a teen) but let her do what she likes and she‚Äôll trust you. Just because she refuses to let you go through her phone doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs hiding anything, she just values her privacy, and you should as well. Have a talk with her about safely using the internet and for the love of god do not go through her phone. This will seriously impact her trust towards you. You should apologize for prying as well.

This is actually not okay, as someone who was blackmailed by the reward of a phone this is incredibly abusive and will lead to more harm than good wether you think so or not. Children should not have their freedom and happiness held against them as a punishment. This will develop a strong feeling of distrust between child and parent. Instead you and the child need to have a heart to heart discussion about why you both feel the way you do and come to a halfway point so both parties are happy, this will teach your child that they can always TALK to you if they find something wrong or if they feel like you are controlling them. Just because you are the parent doesn‚Äôt mean you need to be a tyrant. This is a mutual relationship. This comment section disappoints me.

What would you think if a professor told a 24-year-old student in front of the class that she needs to get over her extreme shyness if she wants to achieve anything in life?
She‚Äôs 24. He is pushing her to be confidence and build a thick skin. That‚Äôs what good professor does: make you a better version of yourself.

How do I stop comparing myself with friends? I'm 21, currently in a limbo w/ a 9-5 job that I don't like but need to help my family's finances, while my friends are doing Masters in rich countries, building own business, or working on their passion.
Some people are born in more advantaged family, some don‚Äòt. Comparing your situation with rich friend is equally to comparing a nokia with iphone: nokia has less features, affordable & out of dated, but tough enough to break the wall and it remains undamaged, last longer under low battery. Iphone looks beautiful, expensive, but drop it to the floor, Iphone broke, you lose $1200. So think about your own advantages, you have your strong will and experiences and hard working. These 3 qualities benefit you in the long run. Most of children comes from rich family have weak mindset since everything is easy to afford.

What do you think could be a reason why this girl told me she felt offended when I called her average looking when I never called her ugly?
if you just blurted out called her average, it‚Äôs rude => she feel offended.
if she asked you ‚ÄúAm I beautiful‚Äù => sane men will always say ‚Äúyes‚Äù. You don‚Äôt want to die, do you? => and yes she feel offended.
if she asked you ‚Äúwhat do you think of me?‚Äù => she consider your opinion is important to her for whatever reason, but you bluntly answered her => she can feel offended
also, she could be insecure about her look.
but in general, nobody associate average with good!‚ÄúAverage Joe‚Äù is a polite way to say ‚Äúincompetent men‚Äù. How would you feel if someone says you‚Äôre an incompetent men?

Is it okay to talk about teachers behind their back even if they do it to a student?
It is in absolute: NOT OKAY to talk behind anyone‚Äôs back, not to mention a teacher. This is a non-spoken rule of life, it gives you benefits in every workplaces- schools and private matters.
One of many reasons came to my mind is that: A teacher may or may not be teaching your class, but he or she is transferring and giving such value thing(s) called knowledges indirectly or directly to you and your friends. Hence shouldn‚Äôt anybody be giving flowers and say thank you to his/her teachers, instead of waisting your time in jibber jabber non-senses?
And please remember that teachers are human, and we- as human being- make some mistakes from time to time.

Take your kids to the therapist. There is absolutely something had happened and she couldnt tell you. So take her to the therapist and always believe in your children. Why would you rather choose to ask some strangers and believe our answer over your daughter?

When you walk pass her again, stop and complement her and then ask her out:

2nd: she says no and you know

Give as much as you can! If you dont want your life, plenty of people need it: donor your organs (provided it‚Äôs healthy and available); give away your money (charities, a beggar on the pavement); visit cancer- sick children/people who wish to live and is fighting for their life as much as they are able to, talk to an old man/women who has been living 3/4 of their life and ask what it means to them. When you‚Äôve done all these things, and you still want to cease your existence, remember to donor your organs and bodies to scientific purpose please.

OR if vaginas aren‚Äôt your thing (and maybe you haven‚Äôt realized) there‚Äôs always the option of having sex with men and I say this seriously. Maybe you don‚Äôt like her vagina because subconsciously you‚Äôre not attracted to vaginas and that‚Äôs okay.

you obviously don‚Äôt care about her enough if you‚Äôre asking this on Reddit of all places; so go ahead, hurt her feelings, embarrass her, break her trust, and ruin your relationship. It‚Äôs yours after all! if you‚Äôre asking us then maybe you‚Äôre scared because you know it isn‚Äôt right.
My honest advice: break up with her and stick to watching porn. You‚Äôll do her a favor and you won‚Äôt have to see such ugly display ever again.

I don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äúin danger‚Äù but she most likely isn‚Äôt. Sit down and talk to her. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend losing your head and screaming at her and taking her phone away; I know that‚Äôs most parent‚Äôs first course of action but from what I remember I often got my laptop taken and hidden away from me as a kid and it only made me smarter when it came to desobeying.

I don‚Äôt know how to say this, I‚Äôm 19 and I genuinely believe that if you can afford it you should definitely take her to a therapist. Sometimes the symptoms are very subtle and she‚Äôs telling you how‚Äôs she‚Äôs feeling. It takes a lot of guts to admit it. You might‚Äôve not seen the signs because she was hiding it, it happens

I would rather have no pets than willy nilly not commit to them. I am fed up with the number of people on sites like Nextdoor who are constantly saying ‚Äúmoving and need to rehome my dog‚Äù like they're donating a pair of shoes. Ugh.

Considering there are black only dating apps (like BLK), along with Indian, Mexican and Asian only sites, there's no reason why ONE other ethnic group shouldn't be allowed/enabled to search singles from only their group (or at least eliminate other groups) they aren't attracted to or interested in.

Came to say the exact same thing. Why does a sick day only pertain to being incapacitated? The guy could have a root canal appointment or something scheduled after his run. It doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt need the time off, and since when is exercise something that proves there‚Äôs nothing medically wrong with you? All jogging proves is that he‚Äôs not calling in wheelchair bound.

How do you respond when a coworker asks for your prayers?
You can accept the request and say that you will (or even ask to pray with them if you're inclined to), or if you are not a praying person you can tell them that you don't pray but your best thoughts are with them, that you will wish for everything to work out, etc and provide general encouragement.

Nobody in the USA should have to be bilingual to work in their own country. English is the language of the land and people need to learn it to immigrate here. We would spend so much less money if we weren't constantly catering to everyone in a million different languages. It's ridiculous.

What should I respond to a coworker who is telling me not to apply to an open position which I am qualified and should give consideration to others who have been with the company for years?
Nothing. Unless that person is in charge of the hiring for this position you don't need to explain yourself at all. Apply for the job and whether you get it or not, you won't wonder ‚Äúwhat if I had tried‚Äù. You don't owe coworkers an explanation, but keep your business to yourself. Blabbing to coworkers who may or may not wish you well is generally a bad idea.

Can someone who's a perfectionist work well with others?
Assuming some things here‚Ä¶ One that we are dealing with a workplace situation and two that we are dealing with a highly productive/functioning perfectionist and not something else. Then no, not without a good deal of personal effort and introspection AND no without the consideration of the employer for the role the person will be expected to play. A perfectionist will encounter two situations in working with others: 1. They will do their utmost to succeed and as a result may find that they are increasingly relied upon to an excessive degree (taken advantage of) because of the extra care and concern they show that others do not.

If you were hungry for a big juicy burger, which burger restaurant is your go-to?
There are several but here are the best in no particular order:
Culver‚Äôs - Double Bacon Deluxe
In-N-Out - Double Double with Grilled Onions (protein style, preferably)
Chili‚Äôs - Oldtimer with Cheese
Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers - Pretty much all of the ones here but definitely the ‚Äò1000 Island‚Äô
Honorable Mention for anyone traveling through Jerome, AZ - The Haunted Hamburger
Their Cheeseburger or Bacon Cheeseburger are fantastic, and they actually know how to lettuce wrap if it‚Äôs your thing.

As a white person living in the States, would you feel better if you lived in a majority white town and surrounded by only whites?
In a way yes, if those people shared like-minded values. The appeal to a homogeneous society (that so much of the rest of the world enjoys and many early American immigrants enjoyed) is the sense of cohesion it has on a surface level, but moreso because there would be other values associated and tied in with that. Shared language being a big one. When people can't easily communicate with their neighbors or community there is no community. Religion is another. Nationalism/local pride is third. Politics is a distant fourth. I would gladly live with any shade of skin color if these values were shared within the community. Diversity for diversity's sake creates divisions and incompatibilities that are not easily overcome if they are overcome at all.

Why do I still feel hideous even when I take care of myself and do things to help with my appearance? Even when I am decent, I still feel this way and I see nothing but uglyness. How can I fix this?
Comparison is the thief of joy.
You may be comparing yourself to people who had no control over their good looks, just as you had no control over yours. Do you compare yourself to people you think are ‚Äúless attractive‚Äù than you? Probably not. These comparisons tend to only go in one direction, feeding envy and resentment.
We all make do with the hand we are dealt. You aren't as ugly as you think you are but your attitude and soul may indeed be ugly which will show up on your face.
Stop comparing yourself to others
Make sure you have a good attitude
Smile often
Be thankful that you aren't more ugly
May sound trite but it has obviously escaped your notice to this point. Try it out.

What advice would you give to someone who feels stuck in their current situation?
Sit down and write out the situations you want to change. Then brainstorm what needs to happen to make them change, and finally break it out into steps that you can take starting today.
Situation: I want to be moved out of my parent‚Äôs house and be independent
What needs to happen: I need to find employment and earn my own money
Steps: Apply for work ‚Äî-> interview ‚Äî-> land a job ‚Äî-> work and save money ‚Äî-> look for a place to live ‚Äî-> move out
This works for a lot of things in life. You don‚Äôt go from being a fat slob to bench pressing 200lbs overnight. You start by going for a walk around the block. It‚Äôs the old adage ‚Äúyou eat the elephant one bite at a time‚Äù.

How does depression affect people who see someone suffering from it?
It depends on your relationship to the person, but overall it‚Äôs a situation that leaves you feeling helpless if you are the type who would want to help, especially when any useful suggestions like going for a walk or eating a healthy meal are met with excuses or refusal. Other people might feel false guilt but they aren‚Äôt responsible for someone else‚Äôs moods or their disorders.

How do you freeze blueberries without them getting mushy?
The best way to freeze whole blueberries (or raspberries) is to wash and let the berries *dry off* THOROUGHLY. Then spread a sheet of parchment paper across the bottom of a jelly roll pan or any shallow baking pan (with sides) that will fit in your freezer. *Spread the berries in a single layer in the pan on the parchment paper.* (Do not let them sit on top of each other.) Place the pan in the freezer so it stays flat and the berries don't shift. Let them freeze for several hours until thoroughly frozen. Then you can scoop them in a freezer bag or a freezer safe container and keep them frozen for several months. Provided your freezer does not thaw out at any time, they will remain nice looking and separate from each other because they were individually frozen beforehand. I've done this many tim‚Ä¶

Should you go where you‚Äôre celebrated and not where you‚Äôre tolerated?
You need both.
Being constantly flattered is a sure way to your getting an inflated view of yourself, to stop critically looking at your own flaws and areas that need improvement. Nobody is truly the center of their own universe.
Being merely tolerated is a sure way towards resentment and bitterness. We all need an opportunity to excel, be useful and appreciated. If you receive no positive feedback, then you lose morale and motivation.
Most of us don't get a perfect balance of what we need or want. That's life. But we can't just ignore life and try to create a false reality for ourselves, despite the number of people who try to do just that. If it comes right down to it, it's far better to live a miserable truth than a fabulous lie.

I agree. Public education on American history is woefully lacking. I received a minimum, but fortunately I love history and devote personal time to studying it for fun. While I think it's important for new citizens to know all about the country they are pledging themselves to, it's equally important to have the birthright citizenry know as well. We wouldn't be in this mess, imo.

Should a young teen minor be allowed to wear a thong bikini, showing her buttocks?
Here‚Äôs my best shot at this- Let your female child wear more revealing stuff and have more freedom when their period comes. When it comes they are a woman and you need to stop limiting as much things as you used to. A bikini is harmless and is everyone really looking at her? No. Not in a rude way. Their are many people at the beach so not everyone is focusing on one person they are more focusing on themselves.

Thank you for this. I was diagnosed with ADHD in college and have suspected autism for years based on my research. It is so hard to find videos of people who have both ADHD and autism despite the fact that that comorbidity is very common. My son has ADHD and he is like me in all the ways that make us both quite annoying to be around but also funny to be around when we aren't overdoing it. But my son and my daughter both see so many things that I don't. People's motivations, common sense things, understanding stories when people annoyingly leave details out. They are able to ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù and ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù. Among many other things. But it has been so hard for me to find an example of someone like you‚Ä¶that I can compare my experience to, to get a sense of whether I am similar to someone with both disorders. I have always felt like two people in one body so it is actually quite difficult to fill out questionnaires and surveys which evaluate for things like autism.
For example: you could not pay me to check my mailbox, answer my front door or answer my phone to an unknown number. But on the other hand, I talk all day long, sing and am infuriating to watch TV with.
When I was a child, I was EXTREMELY orderly. I would not take my toys out of their box after receiving them for my birthday or Christmas. If my mom forced me to let a friend play with one of my toys...I would remove the toy from the box, undo all of the twist-ties which hold it in the packaging and hand it to the friend. I would watch over them while they played with my toy. Then once they left, I would put the toy back exactly how it was, re-twisting all the twist-ties, place it perfectly in the box and put the box back under my bed where I had it previously.
Once I hit my teenage years, I became so messy, so tired and a ‚Äúlazy child"". Now in my early thirties, I clean everyday because I am a stay-at-home mom and put everything back into it's place. But it took a lot of work to get to where I am in regards to that.
I am two polar opposites in one body, just as your comment.

Sorry I'm new to quora so I'm not sure how to add more details to my question. To further elaborate on my question, here are more examples:
Example 1: I researched for years to find a provider who evaluates adult females for autism. I finally found one who was available to see me within a couple weeks. The only catch was that I had to switch my insurance. I went as far as switching my insurance and had to wait a couple weeks for the new insurance to start at the beginning of the following month. Once the following month came, I called the providers office, left a message with my new insurance details because I was starting to feel the stress of talking to someone on the phone. I never received a call back and then I just NEVER called them back. That was one year ago.
Example two: I saw online that someone was asking for a twin bed for a refugee family that they were helping. I have a twin bed that I have been meaning to sell but never did. So I offered it to the woman who posted online. Then once she asked to come pick it up in a few days, I did the same thing‚Ä¶fear and avoidance and go M.I.A.
I don't know why I feel no fear when I seek or offer something. I actually feel happy about helping someone else or finally getting something done. But then once the possibility is made real‚Ä¶I just ghost that person or task. It really hurts so many areas of my life and if I could understand why I do this, then hopefully I could research a solution. Or maybe I will just never come back to this post again because of this very problem.

I've never understood the societal acceptance that attorneys have to kiss up to judges or else perhaps the judge will not be favorable toward that attorney's clients in future proceedings. I understand that in every job, you kind of have to kiss butt of your superiors or at least not be disrespectful. But don't judges have the sworn duty to be fair and impartial to the parties involved, no matter whether they like the representation?
I wanted to be a lawyer, worked in a criminal defense firm for about 1.5 years during undergrad and had every intention of applying to law school and eventually of being an attorney. That 1.5 years broke my spirit. I realized that most lawyers I had met were terrible, emotionally abusive and narcissistic people. I left that job with PTSD and realized that I would be internally destroyed if I had to live in that type of work environment with those types of people every single day. I found out during college that I had ADHD. Only later was I diagnosed with autism. I still wish I could be an attorney but the environment seems like it would honestly be toxic to me.

And my daughter is in the process of being evaluated for autism, once I finally got diagnosed and realized that autism could explain so many things. And my son has ADHD but he and I relate to eachother so much easier than my daughter and I. But every single other thing, it was like looking in a mirror. And the screaming‚Ä¶my God, the screaming. Like knives through my body. When I was a single mom (before I met my partner), everyday was just surviving. I had no idea how to parent myself or be an adult (I was 19 with two kids and undiagnosed autism and PTSD). I took the long way home from work just to get peace because I was so scared of my own kids. The constant panic of not knowing what to do‚Ä¶I was perpetually overwhelmed and felt constant guilt that I was all that my kids had. I met my partner when my kids were about 3 and 4 and he finally gave all of us the stability and structure that we needed. Also, now that my son is 13, my partner has to help me a lot with behavioral stuff. I don't realize when my son is trying to manipulate me but my partner is so intuitive, he just like KNOWS.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
My mom did the same to me. In fact, she told me to my face that depression doesn't exist. I didn't have the words for the way I felt back then because I knew nothing about mental health, all I knew is that I have always felt very different. Fast forward through 14 years of hell, trying to function in the adult world as well as be a mother to my kids. I finally find out that I've been autistic my entire life. I've had my 11 year old daughter in therapy since she was 4 because she was so anxious, angry and obsessive compulsive. She is now also in the process of being evaluated for autism, which has been overlooked by therapists and school officials her entire life. My son got lucky and was diagnosed right away with ADHD, likely because he was a boy. My point is: as women we have enough people‚Ä¶

Greetings from Portland!!
This has been happening to my 2006 nissan maxima. It's currently in the repair shop for the overheating. This is for the most part what happened: temperature gauge started rising, I was stuck on a bridge (bridge was up from a boat) and I got nervous so I shut the car off. When I went to restart, no crank, no start. The main fusible link 120 amp has randomly blown a couple times previously so I recognized that that was the issue straight away (still though, I was stuck on a 1 way bridge with many cars behind me and car was stuck in park because I didn't know how a shift lock works üòÇ‚Ä¶eventually some nice men helped me push the car off the bridge and into the city). Anyway so my husband installs the replacement fusible link battery terminal holder, tops off the coolant (I knew there must be a leak because it seemed the coolant was disappearing). We figured the car would make it the 3 miles to the shop. About 5 minutes into driving, the temp gauge started going up again and before I could pull off the highway, the car stalled for about 20 seconds, was making a real loud ticking sound and then just lost power. (If you're interested, this guy captured exactly what the stall/power loss looked like in my car as well, only about the first 10 seconds of the video is relevant:
https://youtu.be/_iJxqxoBlyASo anyway, after the car stalled and lost power, the main fuse blew again and we had it towed the rest of the way to firestone. The car got a pressure test and all that and the technician doesn't know where the sound is coming from either. This whole time I've been thinking the car must have stalled and died because of a coolant leak/water pump or something but the overheating MUST have caused the car to stall and it most certainly is what lead to the fuse blowing twice in one day, right? So I was thinking that what if when the car gets hot, it has an automatic safety thing that cuts power to the car. I know that everyone says that a main fuse blowing has got to be due to a short in one of the battery cables or whatever but is it possible that if the computer automatically cuts power to the car due to the heat, is that something that could cause enough draw or something (i don't know if this makes any kind of sense because I don't understand how the electrical system works) to blow that fuse? I'm going to ask the technician to check out the oil pressure and fuel pump because after a week of massive research, it seems that these two things can cause a lot of issues which have symptoms such as overheating, car stalling and ticking noises. And I'm hoping to have someone more experienced try to figure out the issue with the fuse/electrical but the heat must be affecting the electrical, or else what kind of crazy coincidence is that?? Wait I just realized that since the fuse definitely either blew when the car was off or when I tried to restart it, then that kind of contradicts my theory. But either way, I guess I'm asking how does heat affect the electrical system in the car?
If you're curious about the overheating and loud noise, the pressure test today showed a ‚Äúbusted radiator"" so that alone could be the cause of the overheating or maybe it's also because there is no oil pressure due to something else as well (he couldn't pressure test the other components in the cooling system since the radiator won't hold pressure so I dunno if there are other issues with that system). As far as the loud sound, the mechanic had no idea where to even start with diagnosing that. He actually told me to just buy a new car haha but I need to know whats really causing all these issues and then MAYBE I'll get a new car if it's something super serious. I've been trying to Sherlock Holmes my way into some leads as to what is plausibly causing all these issues since the mechanics next step would be to just take apart the head and hope to visually find the issue.
But if you know a lot about the electrical aspect of cars, I'd love to get your opinion on that part of it since I haven't really troubleshooted that specific issue with any mechanics yet (I've talked to plenty of mechanics regarding all the other issues though‚Ä¶seems there are wayy too many things that can cause very similar engine sounds but the main fuse repeatedly blowing seems to be relatively uncommon).

I understand your confusion and feel the same way. The books are inconsistent on this - Geralt gets paid lots but seems poor. I think in essence he is actually rich - he gets paid lots of gold and small fortunes, he also has a pension fund in toussaint. However I think it‚Äôs one of those situations where a frugal person - even if they‚Äôre rich - will live poor. Gerald Geralt is used to living on the road, camping, staying in taverns, there actually isn‚Äôt really much he has to spend money on. He could go around showering money on people and eating fabulous banquets but that would be out of character. So I think he is rich but he‚Äôs used to living like a Witcher so he doesn‚Äôt live like a rich man.

Can I pay my entire year lease on an apartment up front?
You can but why would you? I‚Äôm addition to potentially being screwed by your landlord youd actually be spending more money. Inflation continues year round so money I spend today is worth more than money I‚Äôll spend in 11 months. I‚Äôd rather pass the inflation on to my landlord than take on that cost myself.

Thats not true. If both parents have blue eyes the child will have either blue or green eyes. There is a 0% chance of the child having brown eyes in that scenario.

thats actually wrong two blue eyed people will always have either blue eyed or green eyed children as those are recessive traits. A person with brown eyes etc can have a child with blue eyes though, and same with red hair. For example my mom has blue eyes so I carry one gene for blue eyes and if I married a blue eyed woman I would have a 50% chance of having a blue eyed child ( B x b) ‚Ä¢ (b x b) = Bb, Bb, bb, bb.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Well, young adults, aged 18 to 29, are still experiencing cognitive development, and this is one of the reasons why mental illness can present at this time of life. Just from experience in my own family, I wouldn't ignore it. The fact she states she want to see an therapist can be the first sign. Within my own family, that family member stated something was wrong but unfortunately no one ever took it seriously. It wasn't until that family had a full mental health breakdown that made everyone realize something was truly wrong and they spent the better part of a year or so, in and out of mental health facilities. Sometimes the first symptom is the person themselves stating they want to talk to someone. Don't ignore the request.

I‚Äôm a senior in high school. I have a 1.27 GPA. What schools can I apply to? I have done no curricular and haven‚Äôt had a job but I babysit every other week for the past month.
Honestly, no college is going to accept you with that low of a GPA. My advice to you is study more and get serious. After high school, apply to a community college and complete roughly 30‚Äì40 college credits. With that, you can apply to a university as a transfer student and work on your undergraduate degree. I barely had a 2.0 when I graduated high school. I just didn't apply myself because I was lazy. It took time, but I got it together and now I'm four months away from getting my master's degree. Good luck to you.

Yes it‚Äôs best for them to be protected, not all teens do it though! I waited till I was 27, cause once you have sex, feelings get involved and I personally didn‚Äôt want to give that part of me away to just anyone. To me it‚Äôs something sacred. I feel like I agree, I think it has a lot to do with the environment you grow up in. If I ever have children though, while I do believe in values and waiting - till you‚Äôre ready, or you know you‚Äôre going to marry that person - I want to be an accepting parent that they can talk to rather than hide from!

How can I help my 19 yo sister suffering with mental issues. I have tried everything to help her through psychiatrist now it's taking toll on my mental health. My parents know nothing about this and my sister doesn't want to tell them anything?
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear your sister is struggling with this. My sister got her masters in psychology and talking with her about my issues has helped me tremendously to help me understand myself. Many of us have unprocessed attachment trauma from parent-figures which has been passed down from generation to generation. Everyone, wether you feel like you need to or don‚Äôt, should make an effort to learn about their childhood attachment, trauma, triggers, etc. to learn more about themselves, understand themselves and grow within themselves as a person. I would definitely recommend checking out Dr. Nicole LePera on instagram - her name handle is ‚Äúthe.holistic.psychologist.‚Äù She posts a lot of free stuff that is super helpful and that can be helpful in many aspects of life.

As an avid gamer- do not make him stop playing‚Ä¶ i was a honors student and had a 4.2 GPA but played constantly to relieve the stress of highschool. Did homework and studied at school in any free time, gamed all night at home. It was my escape from thinking about school ALL DAY. How would u like to work 9 hours, only to get hone and work 4 more hours unpaid?
yeah.
let kids enjoy their downtime how they want. If his grades are good then hes clearly deserving of some slack
my parents took away my pc and xbox and my grades TANKED. I had no form of stress relief. Getting my homework done before the school day ended was motivated by being able to game at home uninterrupted. Removing my source of motivation meant i had no reason to do my homework during the school day‚Ä¶ got home and procrastinated. Started skipping assignments and failing tests.
they ruined my source of determination!
now im college i make sure to have days to do only class and work, and my off days are dedicated to ONLY gaming. If i dont unwind before the next week, ill start slacking in class and at work.

Why won't anybody hire me because I'm a transgender?
As a queer woman, we dont carry this type of reputation FOR A REASON. Theres a severe disconnect in the LGBTQ community, and it largely stems from which groups lack life experience and education. :/ my question for you is: do you have a USEFUL degree? ( i double majored in Biology because Musical Theater ISNT USEFUL‚Ä¶ classic gay kid degree, but I knew i'd screw myself over in the long run if i didnt do something useful too!) do you have ANY degree? do you have an ex employer who can verify you dont bring personal drama into work? if all three are ""yes"" then you are applying for jobs you arent the best choice for; aim lower first.

Mental health issues can fester over time and crash down hard after being bottled up for too long. Just because she seemed ok before doesn't mean she was ACTUALLY ok, she could have hit a breaking point recently. I'm sure she's very strong but just couldn't hold it in anymore, which is ok because nobodys perfect and she shouldn't have to cope alone!! The best thing you can do is TRUST HER, because she could be really good at hiding the hell that may be inside her mind. I just turned 18 so i assume she's dealing with the same crap as me and every other kid our age. This past year has been SO HARD, and assuming your daughter is either a highschool senior about to graduate or college freshman‚Äî there's a lot of disappointment and regret running through our heads collectively right now.

Not everyone show any symptoms. I‚Äôve been living with suicidal thoughts for years and i did a suicide attempt weeks ago. No one in my family knows a about this. I act totally normal in my house. I laughs, smiles, joke around as usual. My friends even said that i am so laid back because i never show any distress.
Trust your daughter. Take her to the therapy. Don‚Äôt regret anything later. If you want to be a good parent, now is the time.

When i said that i don‚Äôt need to share everything that is happening is my life was because she said that there couldn‚Äôt be any secret between us and she wanted me to tell me literally everything. That‚Äôs why i told her that.

Can I make a meat puree for a 5-month-old?
Infants should not consume anything but breastmilk or formula, until usually a minimum of 6 months; after they've reached 6m and are displaying signs of readiness, introducing solids (including smoothly pureed meats) is usually alright, as long as the infant does not have other inhibiting factors - personally, I had a chat with my kiddo‚Äôs ped before I started (SLOWLY!!!) introducing solids, to make sure we were all on the same page.

Babies are born with physical characteristics (big heads, big eyes, tiny mouths) evolved to attempt to make adults of the species think they're cute; this ‚Äúadorablility factor"" is believed to have developed to encourage mature members of the species to care for the helpless infants, as humans are incapable of living without assistance for many years after birth.

I was being harassed by some boys making very nasty comments and sexual sounds; not sure why they picked me.
I went to the police station to report being sexually harassed - the building happened to be closed to civilians at the time, but i hit the buzzer and an older officer came outside. He told me there was nothing they could do because of spoofing etc and that I should change my phone number (a number I'd had for over a decade at that point).
I came back during hours the building was open because being told there was NOTHING they could or would do despite me being sexually harassed didn't sit well with me.
I went in, and asked the officer behind the glass at the entry if I could at least file a complaint, because it was always the same number (previous officer had disregarded that part)‚Ä¶ he asked me to detail what was going on as he took the report.
When we were just about done, my phone rang. It was them. He asked if I would be willing to allow him to answer my phone, so I passed it under the glass. He tapped the green button and even on the other side, i could hear the sexual moaning and groaning and nasty comments they started making as soon as the phone picked up.
And that it went silent the moment he said ‚ÄúHello, this is officer _____ with the _____ police department.‚Äù He also informed them that a complaint was literally being filed right then.
I never got another call from them again. üòÅ

Would McDonald's allow you to order 100 Big Macs in one go?
Back in the day when 29c hamburger and 39c cheeseburger Wednesdays was a thing, we'd get orders like this all the time. Bigger, actually. While i was working one night, we had 6 school busses pull in and park, and they ordered 300 cheeseburgers and 200 hamburgers. Along with 30 super-size fries.¬∂

fries. (Oops, did I just date myself? LOL.)¬∂

We'd also regularly get orders for 100+ Macs, Cajun chickens (before it was the spicy), Big n Tastys, n‚Äô Tasty‚Äôs, all that stuff. Happened surprisingly often, 20 years ago. Was never considered a big deal, as long as the customer was informed that the wait time would always be 10‚Äì20m on that kind of order. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Major risks are dehydration, and potential coma up to death from things like heat stroke. Other side effects from heat stress include but are not limited to: heat rash, heat cramps, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, excessive fatigue, weakness, dehydration. Possible (and possibly permanent) side effects from heat stroke include but are not limited to: organ swelling, damage to the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys through disintegration of damaged muscle tissue. Things you can do * Do not place them unattended (for any length of time) somewhere that they could possibly overheat, such as an enclosed space like a car. * Stay indoors with AC with when possible, during excessive heat spans.

I agree with her. After 4‚Äì5 years of being together, if you aren‚Äôt sure she‚Äôs the one, then you‚Äôre leading her on and wasting her precious time where she could be out finding someone who WILL be sure of her.

You are being a bad parent. A really, really bad one. Your son is his own person with his own boundaries, RESPECT HIS BOUNDARIES. Unless you want to lose him, he‚Äôll grow up to resent and despise you and will probably cut ties with you. Watch where you walk, apologize for even asking.

I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily blow it off as ‚Äúall of a sudden.‚Äù A lot of the times it‚Äôs a hidden hurt and it gets bad enough to where they HAVE to finally say something because they can‚Äôt handle it on their own anymore. I would take what she‚Äôs telling you and absolutely appreciate her honestly and explain to her that you appreciate her being comfortable enough to talk to you. Not believing your kids is what leads to teen su*cides. Just be supportive, that‚Äôs what you can do

What is the rudest thing a guest has done in your house while paying you a visit? Are you still friends?
I used to live with my dad in a small camper trailer when I was about 14, for my birthday he let me invite a friend from my hometown down to visit and camp on the property with me. When I was showing my friend my home (obviously very small, it was a camper) he looks at me and (not jokingly) says, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre actually trailer trash now?‚Äù I was very upset, we are no longer friends for several reasons.

If she thinks that she has a mental health issue we do know that she wants help and has taken a step in the direction by talking to you. Please listen to her & be there even if you don't believe it. Mental health isn‚Äôt like fever that there will always be overt symptoms, go to a qualified therapist for proper diagnosis.

Nothing.
It's not that my has been perfect, I have made a lot of mistakes and faced a lot of failures too but all of them made me who I am today :)
We act according to our priorities at that particular time, it's possible that a person maybe making a mistake right now but they can't know right now. They'll only know later on and then they will not be the person they are today as they would have learned better.

Most of the people are confused with their passion or purpose of life? How to deal with it?
Just imagine that you had financial independence, you had a house, a car, long holidays, everything which you can buy and a happy family. After that what is it that you would want to do?
That is your passion, and if you haven't figured it out yet it's totally fine there are a lot of things we don't know about ourselves and that's why we need to constant push ourself to explore and know ourself better! ‚ú®

What's the most important money, fame, power or respect?
It all depends on the person, what you have asked is actually a theory! McClelland's theory of needs. Every person is guided by some needs the major ones are need for achievement, need for power and need for affiliation. The need for achievement covers money and fame a person may feel he/she has achieved a lot in terms of fame or money or marks/degrees/education/contribution to field. The need for power covers power and respect, some people want to have power it can be over others or over assets they just want to feel powerful and lastly affiliation is the need to have social connections some people care more about relationships, they even go into careers which requires them to make contacts. So these needs guide us and every person has their own dominant need depending on a lot of factors‚Ä¶

What are the signs you need to love yourself more?
I believe that we often don't give ourselves the liberty we give others, we need to be non judgemental towards ourselves too! If you notice yourself doing some of these then I would say give that love & support to yourself which you show to your friends. If you keep comparing yourself with others on your insta/fb. If the likes on your picture is what your self esteem has started to depend on. If you do not take compliments and instead try to refute them (saying that's not true or giving random explanations for the compliment like it's not me its the dress which is nice) If you believe that you are not good looking. Honestly no one cares about that once you open your mouth, people care how beautiful your mind is! If every good thing you do or have accomplished is somehow lesser than someone else'‚Ä¶

Why does Christianity claim to be the one *true* religion when other religions existed way before it? How are those religions wrong in their beliefs, and if the Christian God can exist, why can't other deities exist?
Christianity is a branch no a religion, all who believe in the story of Jesus Christ are Christians.

They are Native Americans, you have native blood in you, you aren‚Äôt white or any race 100% Indians are all over america( South America and North America for you) I‚Äôll asume you are from USA, using the word black is racist enough in my opinion, there are white and ‚Äúblack‚Äù people all over the world still ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù proudly label themselves as white and everyone else is what? Are Indians also consider black? You must be one of the dumbest people its unbelievable, I just hope you aren‚Äôt an ‚Äúindian‚Äù who wants an excuse, you are one of those who thinks he isn‚Äôt racist so what‚Äôs wrong, it doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs called respect, both n**** and the latin word as well a‚Ä¶

nobody asked what it had to do with love calm down, read first you obviously bring religion to your answer and you don‚Äôt have to go that far, it‚Äôs ok to believe but you sound as if we are ignorant, and I ask what it has to do with love? When did I ask that? Some people think of that as karma but I agree with you, people around you are going to help you or they‚Äôll screw you at first chance, i am me and I won‚Äôt give credit to karma or religion don‚Äôt think you are better because you are religious i understand you try to be a better person anda simply taking the time to go to church is a good example but I‚Äôm sure you have issues so don‚Äôt bring religion to a simple question

B12 can also cause yellow urine, but yeah, it's mainly B2. Also, if you consume food wirh your B-complex, you'll notice less of it in urine. As it will absorb better. You run the risk of secreting more than you want without a meal. Doesn't need to be much, but preferably you want a meal that naturally contains b vitamins (and also Magnesium, but no vitamin c.)

Assuming you're still on this site, how much would it cost me to have a professional prune a large (many decades old) oak tree? It provides shade to my home during the hot summers, acorns and habitat for wildlife, etc. so I want to keep it. However it's had no maintenance in at least 10 years. Limbs are regularly falling on my roof, and a recent storm blew quite a few branches off. Some rather large, at that.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
If you care about your child you should take her seriously.
You are not a mental health professional so it isn't exactly your place to diagnose or decide whether she ‚Äúshows symptoms‚Äù or not. It won't hurt you to take her to see someone for an official diagnosis but it will cause damage to her if you don't.
Its also good to get a second opinion. Therapist, psychologists, and psychiatrists are all different so it's best to research and find out which she should see first. All three may be needed depending on her issue.

I am Polish, yet I have dark hair, tan skin, and green eyes, while most Poles are fair skinned and haired. Is it possible that I'm not really Polish?
Polish people can be dark. My grandfather is 100% polish. He was born with extremely dark/tan skin. So much so that most people don't think he's actually ‚Äúwhite‚Äù or polish.

You are wrong. The drivers don't delay the packages but say a 2-day FedEx parcel is scheduled for Tuesday delivery. The package is at the facility and ready to go Monday but they don't load it up until Tuesday. So yes, FedEx does delay packages even if they could deliver early. I've had this happen many times. Has nothing to do with the The tracking even updates saying ‚Äúat facility- not due for delivery drivers.today""

I disagree, Deku‚Äôs fighting style tends to center around mobility‚Ä¶ unless he was in a confined space and couldn‚Äôt move around too much, he seems to opt for jumping/speeding around his enemy and looking for a open spot for attack. And yes Aang has crazy fast reflexes, but super speed and agility is literally like the backbone of Deku‚Äôs powers, if Deku were to jump around and stay in the air for a good amount of the fight, and keeps his movements unpredictable, Aang wouldn‚Äôt be able to use earth bending to tell where Deku is and wouldn‚Äôt be able to predict his next movements like he can with close combat benders, not to mention Aang has never been up against an opponent with more than one ability, Deku has, and is trained how to quickly adapt if he doesn't know the others full ability.

Are there any animes where the MC has a demon inside him or something (not Naruto or JJK)?
Blue exorcist is a good one!! It‚Äôs about a boy finding out he is the son of satan, and that his ‚Äúdad‚Äù and brother (twin brother, but didn‚Äôt receive any powers) are demon hunters (exorcists) and after satan breaks into his church (his ‚Äúfather‚Äù is a priest) and possessed his ‚Äúdad‚Äù, he‚Äôs forced to draw a sword that releases his powers, so he‚Äôs technically half demon half human but since his powers are tied to the sword, his full power as a demon is only possible if drawn. After the incident he goes with his brother to a trade school that specializes in training exorcists (his brother is a teacher) to be able to train to be one. While at the same time having to live with this new found power and keep it under wraps while at the same time demons have started targeting him now that he‚Äôs drawn the‚Ä¶

My daughter got a helix piercing. She is 18 years old and I did not give her permission. It‚Äôs small and on the top of her right ear but I don‚Äôt know what to make of it. What should I do?
Get over it maybe‚Ä¶? She is 18, a legal adult and can get piercings and tattoos without permission. She obviously isn‚Äôt trying to do anything crazy, helixes are very common and are simply just another pice of jewelry. I‚Äôm 15, I have 3 lobe piercings, and a helix and plan to get a conch later this year and a rook after that‚Ä¶ all the piercings I‚Äôve gotten my mother has happily supported me, drove me and signed for me to get them and have even paid for them (I just recently got both the third lobe and helix done at the same time in which was fairly expensive so I offered to split the money with my mom which we did)‚Ä¶ piercings are nothing crazy and they are simply just preference, I think they look rad cool and I absolutely love how mine look and constantly get compliments‚Ä¶ and if I change my mind in the future I will take them out, simple as that, your daughter is allowed to make decisions for her own body and once she is legally old enough to get them herself there is nothing you can do but to support her decision, I wouldn‚Äôt think to much about it, if anything I‚Äôm sure she would love if you even bought her some new jewelry for it on her birthday or holidays!!

My child ate candy without my consent. They are forbidden from eating any sweets. Is it appropriate to revoke their internet privileges indefinitely to teach them accountability?

May be you are an exception ü§†. I didn't mean reducing the food till extent of malnutrition. But it is not good for health in long term. You may think reducing the food will help you to study more , but if you develop it as habit you will see effects in long run.
Drinking coffee and tea more number of times will make your stomach acidic. Even it is not advisable (exceptions will be always there).

Eating less is not a study tip i would say. Instead taking a short nap or going for walk to avoid sleeping.
Also taking more amount of coffee and tea is not good as it may disturb sleeping habits.

Don't worry. Start seeing positives and you will definitely gain some hope. Don't think of your problem as challenge just take it as opportunity to grow. It is difficult to digest the hurdles in life but not impossible. May be you will not get immediate success, but definitely you will succeed some day. Just that we need to wait for our turn .

What is the fee for an M.Tech in IIT?
I would say something around 1.5 lakhs ( Average of all IITs)
I completed my masters from IIT BHU.
1st semester ‚Äî 42k ( 9k refundable)
2nd - 4th semester ‚Äî 29k per semester
Total ‚Äî 1.25 lakh
Mostly the tuition fees and personal expenses can be managed from stipend of 12.5k per month.
If you are from circuit branches or CSE , you can easily get a summer internship and earn more money from internship stipend.

I disagree with point 7
Who knows if someone hides the covid and prepare to get vaccine. Then health workers may get spreaders of disease.
Some people are seeing mild side effects after taking the vaccine. So it should not be possible to keep the person in house and monitor the health condition for next 30 minutes.
Instead they can increase no of vaccine centers and should allow vaccine in hospital like Apollo as many people in India can afford even if vaccine costs 10k.
It will definitely reduce load on government and can speed up process.
They should also think about options like distribution of self testing kits.

It depends on which country you are from. What law/princples applies pertaining to the citizenships. By that, does your country follows the law of soil or law of blood.. And, yes if your country allows you to have 2 passports, in Indonesia they will allow only children to hold 2 passports before they reached 21 years old to make the ultimate decision which passport they want to hold.

What words can heal you when you are sad?
Usually none. It helps if I sleep on it and get myself busy afterwards.
It also helps if you talk to someone. I mean have a conversation. It boosts your oxytocin ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù hormone.
Hope this helps.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Take her. Listen to her. Never ignore her. She needed her mother by her. It is the right thing to do when your daughter seeks your help. Or else she could take it elsewhere. It is a confusing age to be maybe she needs clarity, someone to talk to and learn how to channel the emotion better.

My husband and I had a big argument about him putting his plate in the dishwasher. Now, he doesn't want to eat anything nor cook. Should I make his lunch?
I leave the arguments at the uptenth times. I only realized he will never do the dishes in the 3rd year of our marriage. Period. Saves the trouble of the endless arguments. It is just a dish. You will still love him though right? Make him lunch ü§ó

Can you take action for managers who fire people for no reason and are mean?
You can sue for wrongful termination or make a complaint. It might not be worth it to sue depending how long you worked there. You don‚Äôt get much severance unless you‚Äôve been there a while. I live in Canada and filed a complaint with the employee standards branch for wrongful termination. I won and was awarded severance pay.

What do I do? I feel absolutely crazy. I woke up at 4 am to this dark evil man figure standing over me and my baby. What could this be or mean? I‚Äôm so shaken up.
From experiences I have had with waking up in the middle of the night it‚Äôs a thing we‚Äôre when you wake up randomly your brain is still working like it‚Äôs in a dream so things like hallucination are very common! So don‚Äôt worry your baby and you are just fine. If you need any other help let me know

Whenever I get a grade below 100%, I feel bad--Even if it's 97; and if it gets down to 94, I'm pissed off. My teachers try to mitigate my discontent, but I tend to expect perfection from what I do. My perfectionist parents' fault. What should I do?
all im saying is dont feel bad because i get like 70% on almost every test i do.

I am going to arrange a appointment soon so I can know for sure. I think I might struggle with it but who knows maybe I just have a low attention span. im 13 and have a attention span of a 5 year old and i often find myself doing good only on things I enjoy. I‚Äôve had teachers tell my parents to check up on it but my mom used to take adderall and she says its not good so I‚Äôve never asked to book a appointment. thank you for helping

What are hearing voices meetings, or where could i find them? I‚Äôve never heard of it but sounds like something worth trying.
I personally don‚Äôt have multiple selves, but hearing somebody actually address one of them sounds like it would totally throw me off for a minute.
There is definitely help in learning from others experiences. It helped me to feel less isolated knowing that other people were going through the same thing as me. To people i would come across everyday, they would say i was crazy, or something along the lines of crazy. Talking to other people about their experiences helped me realize we‚Äôre all just normal people with certain problems that the majority of the population don‚Äôt experience, and therefore they find it strange. Not just for schizoaffective or schizophrenia, but for other mental illnesses too. I use the term mental illness just as an easy term to describe it, but i see it more as just my mind just not being completely rooted to earth and reality.
I also don‚Äôt really like the term delusions either, but it‚Äôs much easier to say just a word than to explain it. I usually don‚Äôt notice my delusions until afterwards, and i‚Äôm just like ‚Äúdid i really believe that?‚Äù but i still hold onto the belief just a little bit. Even if i do notice them while they‚Äôre happening, it‚Äôs just a quick ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt really sound like it would happen‚Äù but it evolves more and that thought goes away. I like how you said ‚Äúimagined experiences are just as real as experiences in physical reality, except the imagined ones only happen inside my head ‚Äú, because they‚Äôre as real as can possibly be when they‚Äôre happening.
I once thought my mom was trying to get me to take meds so she could read and control my thoughts, and then monitor and keep tabs on them to try to convince people i was crazy. I thought she was working with the hospital, my school, the CIA, and trying to turn my whole family against me. I even stopped going to school because i thought scientists from the CIA were working with my school to manipulate electrons in the air to apply microscopic forces, which could then be used to manipulate neurons to control my thoughts and actions. Looking back, i‚Äôm like what in the world was i thinking?? But in the moment, i was more than 100% convinced it was true. Imagined experiences are certainly just as real as experiences in physical reality.

By someone who can temporarily take over the helm for you and [tell/show you/ help you do] what needs to be done to get out of the rough time, at the same time as showing the confidence that it will succeed. That confidence rubs off.
This is in fact quite important for someone in an extreme rock bottom low, who lacks the means and energy to pull it off alone.

Should I find a new therapist? I often leave her office feeling worse, she often invalidates my concerns and perception of things. I told her about a flashback I had and she told me I made it up as a metaphor or like a way to empathize with someone
This ‚Äútherapist‚Äù is most likely someone who fell between the cracks and somehow got permission to treat patients. She is simply using her position to reinforce her ego, and force her narrative onto you. To her, patients like you are a quick fix of energy, which she coincidentally even gets paid to enjoy. If you feel worse once or twice after seeing a therapist, then maybe they asked you an uncomfortable question which made you think about uncomfortable life choices, or thought provoking subjects which you may need to reflect on. But if you regularly leave her office feeling worse than before, less safe, or not helped in the least, then now is a better time than any to not show up to the next appointment and stonewall her. Absolutely no calling her to cancel, or heads up. Cut all contact. Why? S‚Ä¶

Is it okay for your family to get mad after they find out you self-harm? They are making me feel bad and I regret trying to get help because they are taking away my freedom. like my friends, school, going outside etc.
This is a very good question, which does need a little clarification though. Scenario 1: your family finds out, and decide to put blame on you for harming yourself. They make you feel ungrateful and guilty, either consciously or not. They accuse you of having a good life with no reason to harm yourself, and of causing THEM problems and pain. This scenario may be a sign of an abusive family dynamic. In fact, the kind of discrete abuse that often drives people to self surgery. No, that‚Äôs not ok. Scenario 2: They find out, and get mad, but you can tell that it is because they care about you, and that their feelings and worries are not coming from selfishness, but from empathy or at least sympathy. They don‚Äôt necessarily blame you for it and may try to understand, even though they‚Äôre upset with you‚Ä¶

If you are a minor, what are valid reasons to ask for a knife? I want to get a sharp one for self-harm, but I don't want anyone to know I self-harm. How do I ask for one?
Without knowing how old you are, it‚Äôs difficult to say. I will say this, however: the reason behind your wishing to harm your body can be a different one from person to person. What you need to understand is the value you have. You will get to find your dignity if that is what you‚Äôre missing. But I can‚Äôt tell you what you can or can‚Äôt do. Nobody can. I tried it once, because I felt like it. It wasn‚Äôt satisfying at all, so I sat down and wrote a few songs instead, which served to convey whatever I felt at the time, and to further understand what my feelings could teach me. Then, I started to fill up my entire free time with learning knife making, blade smithing, gold and silver smithing. I got bored and designed some aircraft parts which are actually flying today.

It is important to know that invisible disease doesn‚Äôt show symptoms.

If I drive an Audi for hours at its top speed of 220 km/h on the Autobahn (let's say the road is close to empty), would the car start having problems?
So, I did this all the way through Germany on a BMW K1300R.
I was going from Sweden to Stuttgart and had to be at work on time.
Fortunately, there wasn‚Äôt much traffic, which allowed me to remain between 200‚Äì275 nearly all the way.
It was a crappy trip, but the bike is just a workhorse out of this world. It ran perfectly without a single issue and I wouldn‚Äôt buy any other bike when it‚Äôs time for the next one; even if I have to buy it used and rebuild it from scratch.
Modern cars are usually the same. I do long distance high speed trips in my BMW 3‚Äì4 times a month and most of them I‚Äôm able to stay above 200 for pretty much all the way. Not an issue so far!

A very interesting, elaborate and informative answer!
I would, however, ask that you maybe help clarify to some readers the difference between a sociopath, narcissist and a psychopath. It seems relevant to the question.
According to all the reading, personal experience and studying I‚Äôve done so far, psychopaths could very well be capable of questioning the morality behind their behavior- once they‚Äôve gotten out of the impulse which triggered their behavior in the first place, and provided that their condition isn‚Äôt accompanied by narcissistic traits, which is often the case-.
A sociopath, on the other hand, (again, this is just from whatever I‚Äôve been researching on the subject) would be way less likely- as in probably never- to question anything about themselves. Just like the psychopaths in the narcissistic spectrum or the pure narcissists. Of course, I don‚Äôt know if a narcissist would question themselves without voicing it, but I guess that would be rare.
Please correct me if I‚Äôm off or if my statements are incorrect, however for now, I‚Äôm quite convinced that is the case.

What word can you make with these letters, ""tbivrae""?
The only one word would be ‚Äúvibrate‚Äù.
Others could be made, such as ‚Äúbrave it‚Äù, or ‚Äúrave bit‚Äù, but no other single words.

Your friend is actually right!
The selfie above is of me with a pet raccoon, who loves posing for the camera.
I‚Äôve also hand fed wild ones, who were surprisingly gentle and docile.
I‚Äôve cuddled and played with several different adult raccoons, grabbing my fingers and gently nibbling or softly pawing at my ears and face.
The pups are a bit rougher, but the adults seem more aware of their strength and the sharpness of their teeth.
I personally know many people who both have them as pets- domesticated and housebroken, they use litter boxes- as well as rehabbers.
One can do both without a problem, so long as one is aware that they need almost as much time as a child.
Not to mention the facilities needed for them to thrive, such as a dedicated playroom, an outdoor space and, if you like your stuff, safe storage; they‚Äôre known to open doors and turn keys in locks if they want to know what‚Äôs inside.
Greatly entertaining pets, as well as a very rewarding relationship with an animal that‚Äôs just two steps below primates on the intelligence scale.
If you have the means, that is.

While I definitely agree with your answer, I also have to add that adult raccoons, if approached correctly, can be very friendly and fun to be around.
As long as you know not to expect too much, and keep an open mind to their being vastly different than dogs and cats, you should be in for a treat.
Always take care though; Don‚Äôt just walk up to a wild raccoon unless you really know their body language- and their health situation!
If you‚Äôve spent enough time around them, then you should be able to pick up their vibes just like any other animal.
They‚Äôll outsmart dogs and cats, and are said to be intellectually closer to monkeys than to canines or felines, which makes them insanely entertaining.
..and chaotic. Think of them as little animal versions of the Jackass crew, and there‚Äôs your raccoon.

How can you help your daughter stay afloat when she's struggling with her mental health?
Patience, time, conversations about it, and good listening. Make sure you listen to her. Coffee dates and nurturing your relationship together also helps. It‚Äôs helpful to find out the reason she‚Äôs struggling with her mental health and to help her address that. Is it the result of a trauma? Is it problems academically or socially in school? Bullying, or an unexplained mental illness? Or do you both have a difficult relationship with one another? How bad is it, and could it be fixable with therapy and time? Counselling or therapy (contrary to popular opinion, it can be very affordable, look at local ones in your area or at BetterHelp.com). That will help her feel that she‚Äôs doing something to help the problem, even if it‚Äôs not solved right away. Know when to be a mother and when to be a friend. M‚Ä¶

if you really want to wear make darker shades are probably better and wear lipstick not lipgloss. Wear wedges or heels even if you outfit is simple. Everyone look older with there hair down btw so avoid putting your hair up or back. Most importantly be confident even if you don‚Äôt feel that way sooner or later you will start to.

Could you be transmasc and nonbinary?
To me transmasc means being afab and at least one of the following:
more male leaning/male aligned in your gender, which includes many nonbinary people
transitioning in a masculinizing way, either physically or socially, which includes many nonbinary people. This could include wearing masculine clothing, using he/him pronouns, using a masculine name, using masculine coded terms and titles like brother/son/boyfriend, binding your chest, wearing a packer, going on T, etc. This also includes many nonbinary people

I think first dates should be laidback and ideally either be very cheap or free because you're still deciding if you like the person or not and if you don't click then you haven't spent a lot of money on them. But my default for a first date would have to be Barnes and Noble, or I'd want to see if there's anything fun and interesting going on nearby or take them somewhere cool in my hometown like the museum or the park or the outdoor mall or just a picnic.
For a second date I would say somewhere nicer because now you know you like each other enough to see each other again but at least in my case that doesn't equate to catching feelings yet. So like a sitdown restaurant - but not like a super expensive one - or movies.
For a third date I would say probably somewhere more upscale, like the nicest restaurant you can afford or just somewhere really romantic because now things should be starting to heat up and you probably have a good idea of whether you want this to turn into an actual relationship or can see yourself falling in love with them.them. I think this is also a good way of showing that you have money which like. I'm not saying marry for money but I do want to know that whoever I end up with has a stable job and can provide for the household just as well as I can, so getting an idea of their finances is a good idea.

How come society sees it as okay for females to be gay but not males? I personally don‚Äôt have anything against gay people period no matter what the gender, but why the double standard?
I think you're wildl‚Ä¶
First of all, if you're a feminine woman or assumed to be one, it's assumed you're doing that for a man and should be with a man no matter what you say you want. This is often really harmful to us and makes it harder for us to realize we're gay, and also leads our families to harass us about finding a husband and men to think their dicks are the magical right one that will turn us straight.straight. And if you're a masculine woman or assumed to be one, that's assumed to revolve around men too, because you either hate men or have given up on yourself because you can't get one, and being a masc or gnc gay woman is often met with physical violence and heightened discrimination and hypervisibility in the forms of both misogyny AND homophobia.

A lot of the time what she's wearing isn't even that revealing and if adults are sexualizing her that's on the ADULTS to not be pedos. I don't care how skimpy a teenage girl's clothes are, she's a fucking child and deserves to live a happy carefree life wearing what she feels comfortable in as a CHILD instead of being sexualized because of physical changes that she has no control over. It is not the fault of teenage girls that disgusting adult men who control the fashion industry make their clothing sexualized and girls should not be victim blamed if they are sexualized for wearing clothing that they feel comfortable in.

Even some of the most conservative straightlaced holier than thou young people I've met have had tattoos tattoos, colored hair, and piercings. And a lot of people don't really care nowadays. The world is becoming more accepting, you just have to move out of your limited circle who looks down their noses at others over things as small as a little ink in someone's hair or skin.

I currently have lavender hair and a wrist tattoo, planning on two more tattoos within a few months on my upper arm and over my heart, and am a cum laude college graduate with a steady full time job and am starting grad school soon. If someone really wants to assume based off me making personal choices about my appearance that I'm on drugs and constantly partying (neither of which is morally wrong, and anyway alcohol and caffeine are also both drugs that most people find socially acceptable), that's their problem. Colored hair, piercings, tattoos, and other body mods have nothing to do with who you are as a person.

you don't own another person's body just because you're financially supporting them, and giving them control of your body goes way beyond being ‚Äúrespect"" or ‚Äúgratitude.‚Äù also, I hope you don't have kids because you need to realize that being a parent is not creating your own little mini me who will do whatever you want like a robot. Kids are autonomous human beings.

Can you be panromantic and gay?
Gays and lesbians are not m/w attracted. You're not gay if you're pan.

Yeah but it would affect how she treats him so that wouldn't be a healthy relationship. If he can't be close friends with a guy because she worries about cheating or has to constantly censor himself because his girlfriend is homophobic then how is that fair to him?

Do you think being ace/aro inherently makes someone LGBT?
I don't, I think being LGBT means either being not cis or being attracted to the same gender, but I also don't really care if aces and aros who aren't into their same gender identify as straight or consider themselves LGBT as long as they understand that not being attracted to the same gender comes with privilege especially if you're also cis (or able to comfortably pass as cis) and as long as they understand that queer can only be reclaimed by non cis people and people who are attracted to their same gender and aren't disrespectful to LGBT people regardless of how we feel about them being included.

Thank you I never thought of it as something special, but I definitely didn't want to lose it to someone who doesn't care about me and only is after my virginity. I'll tell him when it feels right, especially since I don't want him to accidentally be too much for me or too rough when we do have sex.

Am I really that bad of a boyfriend for being protective and wanting her to be with me instead of going out partying and drinking with her friends all the time?
I think it depends on how serious your protectiveness is. If you need her to be with you 24*7 and you need to be with her 24*7 there's obviously something wrong with that. You could also just be very clingy and there's nothing wrong with that if she's okay with it, but you should also be careful not to get too clingy to the point where it's stalking/abusive. Also if she goes out partying a lot and you're not okay with it you need to talk to her, communication is key to a healthy relationship.

If you don't like your boyfriend break up with him, save him and yourself the trouble and petty arguments. Don't cheat that's all I'm saying, and think about if it's really with it before you do anything.

Even if you're not interested now that doesn't mean you won't be in the future. Sex Ed is there to teach you about how to be careful if more kids took classes like this there wouldn't be as many teen pregnancies as there are. I know a lot of people who say, ‚ÄúI'm never going to have sex, I‚Äôm never going to have kids‚Äù, and then go and do the exact opposite. After taking sex ed I learned a lot about how to prevent getting diseases and one guy I was with tried to get with me without a condom and if I hadn't taken sex ed I would've let him and I would probably be taking care of baby and going down a very different path right now.

Should I cheat on my girlfriend is she doesn‚Äôt give me as much affection and love? I talk to her about it and she never changes. I feel like she doesn‚Äôt like me at all. I give her love and attention but she barely does.
If you don't love her, break up with her. If you don't feel good being around/with her and she doesn't give you the attention you crave, break up with her. If you're going to cheat on her save yourself the trouble and break up with her, save her the trouble. Just find another girl who will give you attention and love. I don't see what's so hard about that, why would you cheat? If you don't like her anymore just end the relationship so you both can move on and find someone better for you.

ya ok, just because she is a despicable human doesn‚Äôt mean you can make sexists comments lol.
Women can screw a lot of men and still have a good life hygiene - just like men - and btw having sex a lot, or with different partners doesn‚Äôt make your vagina loose. That was an urban legend to keep women sexually repressed.
Come on now, it‚Äôs 2022.

i rarely ever drink alcohol, only maybe twice or thrice a year and it‚Äôs just a glass. Last time i got high/drunk or smoked was probably when i was 18 or 19. I just don‚Äôt like feeling dizzy and out of control.¬∂

i got my blood work done because I‚Äôm a vegetarian and had been extremely anemic the first year as i didnt know what i was doing. The time they noticed the cholesterol it was because i went to the doctor saying i felt like i had low blood pressure even though it was normal and felt like fainting everytime i got up and wanted to make sure i wasn‚Äôt anemic again or had mono.
They never helped with the lightheadedness and always focused on the cholesterol even though they assured me my fatigue had nothing to do with that.

More information would be needed here, as usually people with NPD don‚Äôt believe they have NPD and rarely seek treatment.
what I want to know is, what makes you think you have this? What personality traits have you noticed in yourself? What have other people tell you to make you believe this?

it could be something else also, for example maybe he got accepted in a school in a different country, or his parents just told him they are moving, or maybe he accidenrally ran over your pet, like eric forman did, and he don‚Äôt know how to tell you.
Also maybe he will propose and is nervous about doing so and making less time for you because he‚Äôs planning shits but dont count too much on this one:/

This is a joke right ? You‚Äôre asking me to starve myself with a diet that feeds on your muscles to go UNDERweight?
that‚Äôs so dangerous and you don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre speaking to, that kind of comment could well trigger back an eating disorder. But I assume it would be a healthy choice in your eyes, as id be on the skinny side of the unhealthy weight.
As a matter of fact, my hdl is higher and ldl improved a LOT since i went plant based, its just still higher than i would want it to be. And i do meat once in a while, it‚Äôs just rare.
please dont answer questions about nutrition, this is clearly not your forte.

They called me sensitive, their little ball of emotions, but really i was self-harming and idealizing suicide, etc. I was being bullied at school and had not many friends, and the ones i had turned out to be bullies to me as well, i just didnt realize it.

My mom is a nurse and she seems freaked out by these numbers, which i have been working hard to lower and they don‚Äôt seem to bulge. Doctor says i should take the medication but im only 25 and this seems excessive. I want to lower it by myself

I‚Äôm 21. My dad thinks it‚Äôs okay to just give me a room and nothing else, not even food. What should I do?
The amount of people here that are very rude is insane. I‚Äôm sorry. I guess all of them haven‚Äôt been very lucky, or maybe it‚Äôs part of their culture. Idk where you live, but where i live in canada, parents usually support their children at least until they are done with college. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see kids stay at their parents‚Äôs house until quite old - sometimes even jobless most of the year - to focus full time on their university studies. However, it depends on how much money the family makes. I grew up nextdoor to a family with less money, whose kids had to find jobs as soon as they were able to to help pay the bills. They had a rent to pay - less expensive than other mtl rents of course - but that rent included food. i find it has crippled them because they were never able to afford un‚Ä¶

I know my parents‚Äô passcode to screen time. Will it notify them if I put it in?
i‚Äôm not entirely sure. my mother knew when i downloaded apps i couldn‚Äôt have, but that‚Äôs either because it notifies your parents when you download apps (not sure) or because when she screenshared my phone she saw that i had different apps. if you know the password but don‚Äôt want your parents to get notified, you have to turn it off when they‚Äôre asleep so they don‚Äôt screenshare your phone to see the apps you have or are using (depending on what screen time settings you have). in the morning you can either change the age restrictions so all of the apps will automatically be hidden or you can turn the screen restrictions back on if you want to use whatever apps during the day (if it‚Äôs app restrictions) then be careful to not use them when your parents can check your phone. when leaving your phone‚Ä¶

Can you be too young to be asexual?
The answer is plain and simple: no.
Allow me to explain!
I‚Äôm an asexual individual, and my mother happened to tell me what sex was at a young age. Well, my five-year-old fatherless self immediately thought that men s3xu@11y ass@u1t3d women for children to be made. That was off-topic, but the point is I was a young asexual. I knew that I never wanted sex. I thought that no other ‚Äúwomen/girls‚Äù (I‚Äôm bigender too lol) wanted sex. So no, there is no age that is ‚Äútoo young.‚Äù Even I, a literal four or five year old, knew that I was ace.

Which MCYT got y‚Äôall into the community or just the dream smp in general?
This is probably the weirdest way of getting into the Dream SMP ever. (Also I‚Äôm a new fan so this all happened this summer) Basically, I was having stress issues and my online bff told me she would put a meditation video on her profile so I could calm down. There was another link on her profile about five minutes later so I figured that was it and I pressed it. It wasn‚Äôt a link to meditation, it was a link to Dream SMP songs. And you better believe I listened to the entire thing, seen how amazing the plot was, and felt so much better and more fucking powerful. And yeah, I started watching the Dream SMP, and I also watched EvanMCGaming to catch up, so yeah. All because my friend forgot to put up a meditation link.

The professor should not be mocking a student! The prof humiliated her in front of the class. If she‚Äôs nervous, she might have social anxiety or etc., and the professor just made it ten times worse by teaching the student that she isn‚Äôt good enough.

If you're a corporate executive looking to explore acting in Mumbai, I would recommend considering Bollywood consultation classes before diving deeper into the field. These classes can provide you with valuable insights into the unique aspects of the Bollywood industry, its culture, and the specific requirements for acting in this industry.

What will be the effect of de-dollarisation?
Implications for the United States: 1. Loss of Economic Influence: A gradual reduction in the global demand for the U.S. dollar could weaken its economic and geopolitical influence. The ability to impose unilateral financial sanctions may diminish, impacting the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. 2. Increased Borrowing Costs: As dedollarisation progresses, the United States may face higher borrowing costs due to a decrease in the demand for U.S. Treasury bonds. This would have implications for the country's ability to fund its deficits and maintain its economic stability. 3. Opportunities for Collaboration: Dedollarisation also presents an opportunity for the United States to reassess its role in the global economy.

In the context of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), a backlink refers to a hyperlink on a webpage that leads to another webpage. It is sometimes referred to as an inbound link or incoming link. Essentially, a backlink is a link from one website to another. Backlinks play a significant role in SEO because search engines like Google consider them as a form of endorsement or vote of confidence for a webpage. When a webpage has multiple high-quality backlinks from reputable and authoritative websites, search engines tend to perceive it as a valuable and trustworthy source of information. Consequently, such pages may have better chances of ranking higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).

They would negotiate deals with companies or individuals interested in advertising on their sites and display their banners. These agreements were typically based on a fixed fee or a cost-per-impression model. 2. Affiliate Marketing: Websites would promote products or services through affiliate marketing programs.

How exactly does NFT make proof of ownership for any digital art?
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens , make use of blockchain technology to establish and validate proof of ownership for digital art. The key concept behind NFTs is that they create a unique and indivisible token for each piece of digital content, such as artwork, music, videos, or collectibles. This token is stored on a blockchain, which is a decentralized and transparent ledger that records transactions. Here's how NFTs enable proof of ownership for digital art: 1. Unique token creation: To create an NFT, an artist or creator mints a unique token representing a specific piece of digital art. This token is distinct from any other token and contains metadata that describes the artwork, including its title, artist, and a reference to the digital file. 2.

Let‚Äôs see. It costs me $66 to fill my 2 door POS jeep wrangler. (It used to cost $35) My boss now pays me less than minimum wage (a whole other issue in itself). Rent SKYROCKETED. Grocery bills are insane. My gym membership increased by $25/month. Oh and my quiet suburban neighborhood (the only crime we used to get is MAYBE someone running the ONE traffic light in my entire town) is being plagued by car robbers. My license plate was just stolen, boyfriends car robbed, we were robbed from someone on FB marketplace. The cops are not allowed to chase them now, and there is no bail/punishments anymore. The cop said ‚Äúsometimes we are lucky enough to catch them abd bring them in but even then, they are released before the paperwork is finished‚Äù. And most pressing of all?!

Have you ever thought your child was faking being sick, but later discovered it was something serious?
My answer is slightly different than the prompt but I am answering it as the then-teenager whose mother did not believe she was ill. In Dec of 2018 I caught a cold/flu, the same day as my Honors Society ceremony. (I do have a history of anxiety-induced nausea and wanting to stay home from big events or parties etc). My mom let me stay home from school that day but told me I had to go to the ceremony. I was feeling very nauseous but chalked it up to being nervous about walking up on stage. That night, I wasn‚Äôt holding food down. In the next week or so, I lost almost 20lbs because I was too nauseous to eat. I was down to 89lbs. I went to my primary doctor, but my mom was in the room with me. When the doctor asked what I had eaten that day, and I told her a small piece of a sandwich, my mom sa‚Ä¶

Do both parents working at home during covid-19 affect teenagers‚Äô mental health?
10000x yes. At least in my case, (I was 19 at the time in college), my parents would be on Zoom starting very early in the morning. They would talk extremely loud and wake me up every morning. I was unable to concentrate on my schoolwork and classes since both of them were talking non stop. My wifi would also never work since they were on it. I also never had any sort of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and R&R. Every free chance they got, they would barge into my room. Just a side note: I‚Äôve many many issues with my overbearing parents in the past. College was supposed to be my time away from them, instead I ended up feeling suffocated. I know it sounds like I‚Äôm complaining about them, which I admit, I am a little.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Even people without mental health ‚Äúissues‚Äù can benefit from therapy. My mother pulled me out of counseling because she felt that ‚Äúthe therapist wasn‚Äôt helping me‚Äù. Little did she know I have never connected with a therapist as well as I did with that one. Even if she isn‚Äôt ‚Äúill‚Äù, therapy may be beneficial for her and help her navigate this crazy world better.

What is the easiest/fastest way to change yourself?
I think it‚Äôs really to have confidence in yourself even if you don‚Äôt have it, fake it! I totally feel for you. It‚Äôs like you know what you want to happen but can‚Äôt seem to make it happen. I believe in you, often times we feel as though we are not worth it or we are not as good as everyone else, but we just don‚Äôt know that we are actually someone‚Äôs happy pill!

My girlfriend struggles finding a new job since she is tired of doing jobs that she is not interested in? What piece of advice can you give to someone in such a situation?
I don‚Äôt know how old you guys are but I think if she wants to she can volunteer at places she never even thought existed she might like it and eventually want to work for them as an employee. Volunteering is also your willingness to go so if you don‚Äôt feel like it is the place for you you can leave and move on. Best of luck to her! <3

I‚Äôm not really the person to answer your question but I am also almost 17 and I know a lot of friends who also missed out on school due to mental health issues and they also aspire to be something. I suppose all I want to say is that, you can still do it, I believe you can if you really want to. It can be hard but hopefully there are people around you who will show their support for you.

I am also a teenager who, to my parents, show no symptoms of mental health issues. It takes so much courage and energy for someone to come forward and ask for help so I would say, believe your daughter. ‚ÄúSymptoms‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to be obvious, and there are reasons why you haven‚Äôt noticed it and why your daughter didn‚Äôt make it noticeable.

How do I get better at communicating, I don‚Äôt think therapist understands what I‚Äôm trying to say but I‚Äôm not very good at opening up and explaining (least not in a conventional way, I‚Äôm a writer/artist), any tips are appreciated?
I agree with many of the other comments. Try writing it or creating a art piece to convey how you feel before hand, or even during a session. I‚Äôve had many therapist that actually WANTED me to keep a journal of things in my day to day life for them to review.
If you still have trouble connecting with your therapist, that might not be the therapist for you. Every therapist is human and also have their own ways of communicating and connection and it may not be matching yours. That‚Äôs ok. Doesn‚Äôt mean you are a bad patient or you have a bad therapist. It simply means you are mismatched.
The important thing for your sessions is to feel comfortable enough to convey how you feel and speak about the issues you are dealing with, past/present/future.

Should I hide my self harm scars from a potential employer?
There should be no need. Most cases people will not ask the details because they don't notice or it's a pretty intimate thing. If you are in the US they can't use that reason to fire you or not hire you due to health equality protection laws.
If you do get asked, you don't have to answer it. You can make a joke such as I fought a shark or just say it's an intimate question you'd rather not answer.

I will also add to these responses. I was a child that did go to therapy for issues (PTSD anxiety depression adhd).

There used to be super superstitions about black cats in Europe. ‚ÄúIf one crosses your path it's bad luck‚Äù They were an omen of death and misfortune. It was also believed they could transform and be spies for demons.
Cats are considered lucky in ancient Egypt. They represent the goddess Bastet and it was a crime to harm a cat in any way. They are also associated with the goddess Isis. She is the goddess of healing and magic.
Cats are also the favorite animal of the Norse goddess Freya. She is the goddess of luck, love and fertility.
So it really depends on different cultures. In my personal experience black cats have been the most affectionate and talkative of cats. They are really wonderful.

Nothing changes unless you take the first step to change it. Now don‚Äôt tell her in a rude or mean way. Ask to talk to her about your feelings. Ask her, politely, to be patient while you get everything you feel out. Once you do, keep in mind that a proper healthy conversation is a 2 way street. Ask for her feedback.

I was actually was going to put that point of view.
As a child who was put up for adoption with my brother. I was 5 1/2 And he was 4. I was fortunate my birth mother have me up for adoption.
She was not ready to be a mother. Physically, sure. She was around 35. But she neglected us, we went hungry. Left us in running bathtubs, etc. She was desperate for money and dated men and have kids to get child support. One of these men was a violent alcoholic. She left us with ‚Ä¶. Questionable people. I won't go into details.
Now. Despite all of this, she did love us. Various little things have proved that to me. The adoption itself is a proof of that.
Though as a child no matter how bad the situation, I grieved. Over the loss of her. For years.
Now my adopted parents. . They showered me with love, disciplined me and spoiled me. My situation got better after the adoption.
Not all adoptions are pretty though. Some go from bad to worse.

What are some things that you respond to by saying ‚ÄúI can only imagine‚Äù?
Having superpowers. Things that aren't physically possible at the moment.
Everything else isn't limited to imagination for me as I plan to experience as much as I possibly can so at the end of my life I don' have regrets and end with the ‚ÄúI can only imagine‚Äù. This is my bucket list. I know it's a strange one but I'm naturally a curious person. I have an ever active imagination and I don't sit still very well. Of course at the end of it all it won‚Äôt be possible to do everything. A human just doesn't live long enough. But I will have a very full life. That's the plan anyways.
So I guess my personal answer to your question is, that statement is unknown at the moment.

What does it mean when a girl says to me, ""when the once we talked I was feeling down and you made me laugh so‚Ä¶ thanks""?
Well first, every person is different. So my guess could be wrong.
But as a female who has had her depressed moments, I will say it's most likely literal. She‚Äôs grateful to you for bringing smile to her face when she couldn't find a reason to. You may have (or may not) have been the only one to do that that day and it's her words of appreciation.
Basically, she appreciated the effort you put I giving her attention when she needed that laugh whether you knew it or not.
I‚Äôm being slightly redundant. It' late and I'm writing this as I'm about to sleep.
I guess my point is when a girl says thanks, it's just that. Appreciation and politeness. It can have other things wrapped in depending on the situation but the only real way to know is ask her herself directly.

While agree with letting a person believe as they wish there can be a negative effect.
When I was a child an adult showed me a snake bite and told me a vampire bit them. I did not learn vampires were not real until I was 10. So while I know they are not real, I have constant doubts. Which led to me doubting myself and even at times reality. Which brought my low self esteem lower. I kept hating myself for not being able to believe what I know.
I have ADHD and PTSD, anxiety and depression. Which may or may not have affected this.
Another effect of this lie told to me as a child (before I was adopted) was I grew quite obsessed. I won't go into detail as I already said quite a bit I haven't admitted before.
I guess my point is that the high schooler will eventually find out or figure it out. There could be effects we can' predict as everyone reacts to different things differently due to them being individual in various ways. But then again it might not affect him.

How do you go about your (old) self harm scars at work, and around people who you are not close with?
Don't be ashamed. They are your battle scars. You survived a hard time and healed. They have a story behind them. Be proud that you overcome the addiction/obstacles in your life that caused you to start. Most people won't ask as 1) they don't notice them or 2) they are not sure how to. (When ever I have brought it up that's the reactions they gave) I had cut when I was 15 yrs old and did for 5 yrs. I've been cut free/cutting sober for 4 years now. Some of mine show still. They are a proof of me overcoming the shame I felt for the abuse I went through as a child‚Ä¶ that's not a thing to be ashamed of but be proud of. Even for people who cut simply because of depression and stress and not from a traumatic event, should not be ashamed as stopping shows strength to overcome your own darkness. Of co‚Ä¶

Umm‚Ä¶ What do you mean you ‚Äúcaught‚Äù her using pads? She's a female, so she's going to have periods until she hits menopause, and she will continue *NEEDING* menstrual products like pads until then. The only things you *should* do now are buy her the products she needs, and make sure she's not in any pain (which periods can cause), and that she feels safe, supported and happy.

Our son is 27 and still lives with us. He pays rent and helps with bills and claims an apartment is too expensive these days. I feel like he‚Äôs lying as when I was his age, it was easy for me. How do I force him to move out?
I'm 26 and my sister (my roommate) is 29. Neither of us can afford to live on our own right now. I'm moving out in nine months (to move in with my boyfriend) and haven't been able to save anything as I *just finally* found (and landed) myself a full-time job.
Rentals are outrageously expensive if you're trying to live on your own these days. No one really can, unless they were born into money, or they managed to land themselves a high-paying career. But even ‚Äúcheap‚Äù places in my area are over $1000/month, and that's not including electricity, water/sewer, garbage, parking, pets (which typically takes an additional deposit plus monthly pet rent, on top of food, etc.), groceries and personal expenses, insurance, and so on.

That's basically my current strategy. Despite the fact that I've been with my company for over 5 years now (I have a note in my company portal page that says ‚ÄúSeniority,‚Äù meaning I should be able to get more hours before they're offered to others, especially if I ask for extra hours as long as I don't go into overtime), but my manager's boss is trying to cut me back to a part-time 16. I was told by my manager - and another department manager - that from what they know, he can't do that, especially since I have seniority and I have been asking for more hours and opening up my availability. So, they both recommended that I reach out to our Union Rep, just to be sure. They also advised me to look for another job if he is able to deny me more hours. I've already started looking elsewhere because I'm not about to go without health insurance.

Why are pro-choice people opposed to choosing life?
I was raised in an Independent Baptist church, but I'm spiritual now, rather than conforming to a major religion. I still believe in God, but I am pro-choice. Because of my own spiritual beliefs, I wouldn't get an abortion. Instead, if I really believed that I couldn't raise a child, I would talk with the baby's father and see how he felt about putting the baby up for adoption. However, I was raised to believe that God gave us free will. That is: the freedom to choose. So, why then, do other imperfect people (like myself) feel they have the right to tell others what they can and cannot do when it's going to majorly affect that person's life? It's not your life. It's not your body. And you don't know the circumstances, either. Sure, some people choose to abort a pregnancy simply because they‚Ä¶

I plagiarized only part of an assignment and the professor gave me a zero and would not let me redo it. How can I change his mind? I really need a good grade in the course.
I'm not really sure that's possible. I hope you learned your lesson after that; I assume you wouldn't want someone to steal your hard work.
But for future reference, if you find useful information in an article that you'd like to use in future assignments, rather than trying to pass it off as your own thoughts, all you have to do is either paraphrase, or directly quote the article, and provide the source. Both in the assignment and on your ‚ÄúResources‚Äù/‚ÄùWorks Cited"" page(s).
Good luck to you. And remember to always give credit where credit's due.

My 18-year-old son continues to play video games even after I smashed his laptop and deleted his Steam account. How can I permanently put an end to his gaming?
Ummm... you know that people make a living streaming their games, right? What if your son wants to be a streamer? As his parent, you should support his decision. And if he just likes gaming to relax and have fun, why would you want to take that away from him? And in such an extreme way? If you had such a problem with his gaming, instead of deleting his account and smashing his laptop - which you should replace, since he could actually sue you for destruction of property - you should have just sat him down and talked to him about it LIKE AN ADULT. You could have suggested doing other things, while still making it clear that there's NOTHING WRONG with playing video games. So, all that's left now, is for you to apologize to him and replace his laptop and any games he had downloaded on his Steam‚Ä¶

My 20-year-old daughter wants to move in with us until she is finished with college. She says she will pay the bills but she is a grown adult. How do I tell her that adults leave the nest?
You're seriously going to tell your own child that she needs to move out simply because she's ‚Äúan adult?‚Äù My parents never allowed me to work while I was in High school, or college. I wasn't ‚Äúallowed"" to work, until after my mother died, and my father suffered a massive stroke. I was 21-yrs old by the time I started working. I got a job so that my oldest sister, my other sister, her (now) ex-husband and I could take care of him. But, because I couldn't handle the workload from college, my actual job, and taking care of my dad, I had to drop out of college. And now, because of this job, I can barely afford rent, bills and average necessities, let alone starting college up, again.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I have a sister with two mental health issues (high functioning autism and bipolar) and a brother with ADHD. And I've suspected for about 11 years, now, that I have some mental health issues of my own. My sister and brother got the help they needed, and now they're both happy, healthy adults. *Possibly triggering* I, however, have never been able to talk to a therapist for more than a few weeks, and I've thought about suicide hundreds of times since I tried when I was around 13 or 14. Aside from that, many family members and friends suspect that (and have straight up asked if) I have high functioning autism or OCD. I talked to my high school's psychologist a few times throughout my senior year, after my mom passed away from cancer, and each time I talked with her, I honestly did feel better. A‚Ä¶

Exactly, thank you! One of the best responses on here so far!
Not only would I have been grounded ‚Äúuntil my parents said I wasn't,‚Äù I would have also been made to do anything to earn money to pay them back, but they definitely wouldn't have used any of that back pay towards anything like that, again. I would have had to earn money for it, myself.
This kid is lucky to have a parent who is willing to buy stuff like that for them. One of the two gaming consoles I had growing up was a hand-me-down from one of my cousins (an Xbox 360), and the only new one we had was a Wii. My siblings and I had to share them; we didn't get our own. And even now, as an adult, I don't make much, so the PS4 I have was pre-owned when I bought it. But I'm very happy to finally have one that's my own that works well.
That kid should have thanked their parent(s) and been happy with what he got.

My 15-year-old son destroyed his new PS5 because I didn‚Äôt buy him a gaming PC. Should I give in or hold my ground and buy him another new PS5 instead?
If YOU paid for that PS5, HE should be paying YOU back for it.
Now, I'm definitely not saying you should do this, but if my parents had gotten me a gift like that and I had destroyed it because I didn't get something else I wanted - especially at his age - they would have beat my a**.
You spent your hard earned money on that for him; he should have said ‚ÄúThank you"" and been grateful that he has such an awesome parent. In my own personal opinion, YOU should not get him anything. He should be apologizing to you for acting like that and destroying something you got for him.
I just hope he didn't hurt your feelings.

To add to this, I‚Äôve caught him multiple times. The first time I left him for a couple weeks but we ended up talking it out and he promised he would stop and would work on being better for our relationship and just overall. He tells me it really is just an addiction and it means nothing to him but if thats true then why does he still do it?? He tells me and shows me that he genuinely loves me but if thats the case why cant he stop this one thing I am asking hin to stop?? Why cant he realize how much it breaks my heart?? I guess the question is does he really love me if he‚Äôs doing this to me?? I am open to any advice at this point.

Please listen to your daughter. Although she may not show symptoms, doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt fighting her own battles in her head. And if she is she shouldn‚Äôt have to do it alone. I went through the same thing with my mom, she used to be a tough love kind of parent. Growing up I kind of just learned to deal with my emotions or shoved them to the back. Till I couldn‚Äôt anymore, and I got really bad. It had to get scary before my mom realized not all things can be dealt with in silence. She eventually put me in therapy, i was about 14 at the time. I still have my days, but im now 22 years old and can say therapy helped keep me alive.

Don‚Äôt belittle your daughter. She is reaching out for help don‚Äôt make her feel worse as if she‚Äôs lying you can‚Äôt always see mental health issues & people are good at masking it out of guilt or other reasons. Get the help your daughter wants. Be supportive, loving, be there for her, be open minded & never make her feel lesser than. It‚Äôs better to be loving & supportive than judgmental & frustrated. You don‚Äôt want to be the type of parent that is the cause to more pain then wonder why they kill themself.

My child wants to see me but I don‚Äôt want anything to do with it or its mother. I‚Äôm already paying child support. How do I tell the mother to stop telling me to visit her and the child?
It sounds like to me the root of the issue is that the mother wants more of a relationship than you are willing to give and she holds the child‚Äôs visitation together with her own visitation with you and you want no part of that. You can see your child without having to visit the mother. Do not make your child suffer because her mother is an idiot.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Two very possible answers to this question are, A: Your daughter has mental health issues and she has been trying to handle them and fight them for a while now but finally got enough courage to ask for help, and she chose you to all for help; or, B: Your daughter is making up the fact that she thinks she has mental health issues because, as you said, she has no symptoms. But if, in fact, she is making it up, then she clearly is displaying symptoms by virtue of claiming falsely that she thinks she has mental illness. What is her reason for doing this? Does she have a history of being over dramatic? Has she claimed she was really sick and absolutely nothing has been found in the past? Could those be the signs you missed? How would you know unless you are educated in the study of mental health?‚Ä¶

As someone who has severe mental health issues, what the hell? ¬®THINKs she has mental health issues¬®. I myself have heard people say i was lying about my depression and su!c!dal thoughts and it just made it worse. You should ALWAYS believe you child in situations like this. No one believed me until i attempted to unalive myself. Before its too late, get her a therapist as soon a possible.

She hasn't shown any symptoms before because some people are very good at hiding it. Even without trying to hide.
If she is actually saying she wants to see a therapist that is a good thing. She is trying to get the care she needs before it gets much worse. You wouldn't want to ignore it and find out when it is too late that she is at her worst. It is much easier to care for when you catch it early.
Even if she wasn't telling the truth, what harm is it to let her see a therapist. It's always good to have someone to talk to.

Hi, question am I a sociopath ? I‚Äôve never loved anybody in my life including every person in my family even though they‚Äôve done no wrong to me, caused me no trauma ever. I‚Äôve done some very bad things to them and I‚Äôve had my mom bawl her eyes out right in front of me just begging me to hug her and I didn‚Äôt feel bad at all. So I‚Äôve never loved anybody in anyway even when I have every reason to, I‚Äôve never cared for anybody, I‚Äôve never felt bad for any of the things i‚Äôve done, no empathy for others if they get hurt right in front of me even babies, or if they tell me about the very bad things that have happened or is happening to them i‚Äôll just want them to stop talking or have them tell me more because it‚Äôs interesting just no care, if someone in my life dies it also won‚Äôt affect me at all. Keep in mind that my family has always shown me so much love when I was younger and still do to this day.

Gaige Grosskreutz did not attack Kyle Rittenhouse. Gaige raised his hands, and Kyle responded by aiming his rifle at him. If Gaige did not intend to harm Kyle, how can his shooting be justified?
Dude, I dunno if you haven't been following the trial & evidence or something, but I think we've all been through this. Gauge 100% pursued him and pointed a gun in his face, and whether or not they will admit it, I think just about anyone would have fired in that situation

Dude, TRUST ME, you need to invest in sorghum. It's a drought-resistant crop that grows in arid environments, it's a ‚Äúsuper-protein"" just like how the nerds described quinoa, and you can use it to make gluten-free beer. Climate change and hipsters are going to make this a GOLD MINE, and honestly if I had money I'd be dumping it into sorghum futures

I feel that. I'm in a similar situation with the aspie recognition coming way too late in life.

This is impossible to answer without knowing what ‚Äúmental health issues"" she believes she has. Yes, its possible to spend too much time on webMD and self-diagnose all kinds of stuff, but it's also possible for your girl to have a shitload of stuff going on in her head that she has never revealed to you. Just take her to a psychologist, they will give you a much more reliable answer than a bunch of random strangers reacting to the minimal info you provided

Take her to see a therapist, not all mental health issues have clear visible symptoms. She could be feeling like this for a while and maybe she hasn‚Äôt told you sooner is bc she thought you wouldn‚Äôt believe her. Take her to someone who can properly diagnose her and you‚Äôll see what happens there. Don‚Äôt just brush it off bc ‚Äúshe hasn‚Äôt shown any symptoms‚Äù she probably has but you may not have known they were symptoms. She‚Äôs 18, she‚Äôs old enough to know if she has something wrong with her and on top of everything, why would she be faking a mental illness?

So MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) is just really bad depression. BP1 (Bipolar disorder 1) is manic depression where it‚Äôs to low or high extremes of depression. Worse than MDD. And BP2 (Bipolar disorder 2) is depressive episodes but it‚Äôs not as bad as MDD or BP1. So it‚Äôs not major depression or extreme depression. It‚Äôs more so your emotions dropping for a bit but then being normal again.

Does the medication really work to come out of depression?
Sometimes. There‚Äôs psychpharmacogenomic testing available. It analyzes an individual‚Äôs own blood chemistry to help find out which medications may work best. This saves many weeks of trial and error.

Okay first of all you wouldn‚Äôt notice symptoms because as a parent you just look at us as every day kids. For example, I‚Äôm 17, I got deathly sick and yet my mom called me a lazy teenager and when I went to a doctor I apparently had low blood levels and was considered just about dead. Not only that but I was deemed as an antisocial teenager so when I said I think I might have depression I was told it‚Äôs just a trend. I told a parent I thought I had anxiety they said it was obvious but the other parent refused to take me to a doctor. I was diagnosed with ADHD when little yet was pulled off medication and now it‚Äôs hard for me to focus and I didn‚Äôt know why till I learned that. If you or your partner of this child has or had mental issues it could also be passed down. Recently learned my father‚Ä¶

Can psychopaths be nice?
I can definitely be nice. 95% of the time it‚Äôs not real but I can definitely fake it. Just leave me the fuck alone and don't be annoying, and you're good. üòå

This is absolutely correct. While I understand the sadistic label, I could never be a ‚Äútrue sadist‚Äù because of the empathy/emotional aspect. I won't and don't feel bad. It's impossible.

If a psychopath loses family members such as a father, a mother, a spouse or their children, how would they feel?
My mom died in 2019 and I was more upset that I would never get an apology. I glared at her pictures and tried to feel something but nothing was there.

Is it okay to let my 15 year old son sleep in the same room as her 18 year old sister?
Why wouldn‚Äôt it be okay? Has she done something to make it not okay? Has he? That would be the only reason why I would not be okay with two teenagers from my womb to not be alone in the same room like that. Otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt mind it at all. Actually, I‚Äôd find it endearing!

My teenage son doesn't let me check his smartphone. Is he trying to hide something wrong?
Most likely not. Teenagers are territorial. They‚Äôre just like us adults. It‚Äôs the one thing they get to have that‚Äôs all their own. They‚Äôre real first responsibility. Worry about whataboutisms when you have a legitimate reason for one, not just because you can‚Äôt have your way. As parents, we‚Äôre supposed to do better. Pick your battles accordingly.

What happens when Child Protective Services (CPS) comes to your house for an anonymous tip that neglect is occurring in the household but nothing was found upon inspection? Do they leave immediately or ask questions first?
I‚Äôve been there three times. They do leave but not before starting an investigation. The investigation can last up to 10 business days, even if they find no legit reason to keep it open. They have multiple people to investigate, so just be patient. It‚Äôs infuriating, but they‚Äôre just doing their job. If you know you‚Äôre doing the right thing, you have nothing to worry about‚Ä¶.at least in my experience.
*Note: My case is not everyone else‚Äôs and just because you‚Äôre innocent of the accusations, you can still lose your child. My mom lost custody of me when I was younger for the exact reason. 30 years later, they wrote her an apology and admitted the caseworker was fired shortly afterwards but they didn‚Äôt notify her. Smh

Is there a way to get back that feeling of being young again, like when we were children, without doing anything drastic or risky (like plastic surgery)?
Yes. First you stop letting societal norms tell you how and when you grow up. Dye your hair. Get that tattoo or piercing. Collect those toys. Run around on the playground. Color. Watch those movies and shows. Sing the songs. Don't worry about what other people think.
As long as your bills are paid and you're not hurting anyone, don't worry about what other people think.
Let your inner child out. It's ok.

Do you think families should stay together more or encourage young adults to move out and live independently? Why or why not?
It depends upon quite a few things. If the parents and/or children are toxic and abusive, then parting ways is the best idea. If there is a healthy relationship between the two, as long as the children are paying their fair share of bills and help around the house, there is no reason why adult children can't and shouldn't live with their parents. With how expensive everything is getting, it makes more sense anyways.

I'm a 15 year old girl in high school and I have strong feelings for my 27 year old teacher. What should I do?
Focus on school. You're just going through puberty and the feelings will pass. I had a crush on some adults once I hit puberty. As long as your teacher doesn't pursue anything and neither do you, it's ok. Remember that if something happens between you two, there are severe consequences. I'm not going to shame you for normal teenage problems.

You usually won't be able to tell who the baby will look like until they are closer to a year old, sometimes later. Babies go through a lot of physical changes.

What should I do? My GF is saying that either we get married or she will dump me. We have a 7-year relationship but I'm still not ready to get married. I love her but she is leaving me unless we arrange a wedding in the next 3 months.
It took you seven ye‚Ä¶
Now, I can say no more benefit of the doubt. He has months before I turn 30. If there is no ring it‚Äôs over.
As much as it hurts me to the soul to say that, I have to think about my aspirations and goals. He may be an amazing boyfriend, father, and dedicated to us as a family. However, his fear of commitment or whatever his dilemma is is no excuse! You had 9 years! To break up, get therapy or w.e. I flat told him that I never once l doubted him as my life partner but does he though? I mean people engage with no freaking money so, the bar was so low for him for years. I hope he makes the right decision. Time is ticking. He either comes into a new decade with me or not.
So, ¬∂

So, my advice. Envision your life without her for a moment. advice.Ask yourself these questions. Please sit in quiet area. Put some beach waves sounds. Be calm and close your eyes. Now, You had 7 years to process this/her and you should get an immediate answer to all these questions. Is she the woman of your dreams? Do you want to see her when you come home late and tired from work? Are you willing to be with her when times get rough? Through her low points and successes? Is she the mother you would like for your future children? Does she bring out the best in you? And you in her? Do you feel like you can be your ABSOLUTE unique self with her? Has your relationship been mostly laughs and joys together? (Fights here and there are healthy) Do you want to be old wrinkly and see her as your wrinkly love/wife? Do you feel like you want to date other and see what‚Äôs out there? Let this woman go if you if you answered yes to one or are not sure. You have waisted her time. You may not be IN love with her but do love LOVE her. Big difference. So respect and love her enough to let her go. Don‚Äôt be selfish! She is not the one and it‚Äôs OK. Don‚Äôt hog her up. This can be a time to find the one for you and her.
Bear wishes.‚Ä¶

Hello mom
I was also victim of abuse. I witnessed DV my whole childhood. My parents are dysfunctional and lawless individuals. It‚Äôs never easy leaving or setting boundaries with parents. However, I wanted to live a healthy life. My parents will never change or get the professional help so I had to leave them there. They don‚Äôt even acknowledge or even pitty their adult children for seeing abuse their whole life. It‚Äôs all finger pointing, no accountability. All I can do is love them from afar.
I can understand why your son has no come back. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll come back anytime soon. He went through so much abuse while you stood there and did nothing. He has the right to never come back. That is your consequence. When GOD or himself gives him the green light to forgive you and hear your side, he will reach out. Forgiveness is not rushed. Don‚Äôt wait around and live your healthiest life. Get professional help like a therapist. Come to peace with yourself.

Hey love. First off, she has codependency and jealousy issues. Jealousy is normal to feel but to a certain extent. Once actions are present such as ‚Äúgetting mad‚Äù, it is a red flag to have in a friend. You do not need to stick to one friend and you can surely have multiple friends. Even if she is your best friend. I would say talk to her first. Ask her what makes her ‚Äúmad‚Äù or uncomfortable. If the reason is understandable like she does not want to lose you to a friend or she is not a good person for you for xyz reasons, try to hear her out. If its a just because or no reason, express to her that what she does makes you uncomfortable. You should not feel shame from her because you have other friends.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Hello momma! I was once that teenager in the early 2000s. When mental health/seeking a therapist was ‚Äútaboo‚Äù. Now, as a mother, pursuing my career as a therapist, and healing intergenerational trauma, what you are doing is harming her. Assuming that ‚Äúall of assuden‚Äù something is wrong is not healthy. Even if she is ‚Äúfaking‚Äù or wanting attention, take her to a professional anyways. We are in different times. A PANDEMIC. If Im an adult and have never felt so much fear and stress, I can only imagine a child. Be supportive and words are damaging. Choose your words wisely.

My step sister clearly wants me, but she has a boyfriend. What should I do?
Treat this as any other situation involving two people, one has a SO. If that person wants someone else, they should either control them self or break up with their SO first. OR in the weird scenario, the SO wants an open relationship or is okay with you messing with other people. So my advice, stay away unless she does not have a partner. Also, your parents may find it weird.

My mom wants me to have children, but I don't want to. She keeps telling me that she wants grandchildren and it makes me uncomfortable. What should I do?
One thing you can do is tell her, you are pregnant. And after a couple months tell her you had a miscarriage. She will be uncomfortable asking about grand kids after that. My sister did this and, it worked.

I'm pretty sure I have enough sense to know the answer, but to make sure, as an underaged girl, can I take a picture of myself nude as long as it doesn't show my boobs and below?
Yes. Taking a picture while nude is different from a nude photo or pornographic photo. You can take a picture of yourself in the shower and not reveal anything and post it online without being taken down or anything. It's pretty common sense though, you cant just cover you're breasts with your arm, take a picture, post it, and get away with it because that context is different. Just use judgement. Also, no one is really going to know you're underaged. So you can go anywhere, say you're 18, post a nude, and have basically nothing happen. I recommend against that though.

Because what's the point of getting a yes when you made her feel like she had to say yes? Making sure the person feels like they're able to say no without feeling like they'll upset you or make the relationship awkward is important.

You're literally the hottest girl I've seen though. I have no idea how many guys would choose you over the body type you described, I can imagine it's a lot, maybe most, but these words are hollow because I have nothing to back it up and you can just not believe me. But if someone thinks you're half as hot as I think you are, you should be fine.

Yeah no. Broly is way stronger than Majin Vegeta. There is certainly an argument that he's stronger than Super Broly. You have to first understand that the movies take place in their own continuity, so you can't intuitively say that Broly was about Cell level because it happened around the Cell games. Everyone in that first movie is stronger than they are in the Boo saga. At the very least Broly during the first movie was Boohan level. And he's only stronger in his second coming.

It's still justified in this scenario. If somebody was delusional enough to genuinely believe something like this, I think it would be justified. The likelyhood of the scenario being justified is void if somebody believes it to be true. Also, let's get something a little more grounded in reality. If somebody convinced you that you're family is hostage and they would only be released was for you to rape somebody, then that would be justified. The point that it can be justified still stands.

Where can I watch Dragon Ball Heroes for free? English dub is preferable.
You can easily find the episodes on Youtube, and there is no English dub. There They're probably never going to make one as the game they‚Äôre promoting with the anime is only available in Japan.

Why is it so rare to see transgender people dating each other?
Because there aren't many trans people. That's why you don't see many bi people dating the same sex, it's more common to find a straight person, therefore it's more common to find bi people in straight relationships. Trans people do often date each other as they'll obviously feel incredibly comforted and accepted in their company, it's just that they're not as likely to find a trans person as they are to find a cis person.

It's all in the prol‚Ä¶
There, Paragus and his son would spar and he would learn that, on top of Broly's power being incredible, Broly struggled to control his power. He would then remove his tail and develop a suppressive colar collar to shock Broly any time things got out of hand.

What is Broly's origin in the new movie?
It's all in the prologue along with the flashback later on. He was born with an incredibly large power-level and Vegeta didn't like how his strength overshadowed that of his son. Because of his fear and jealousy, he had him sent away to a hostile planet. When Paragus, Broly's father learned about that, he went to chase after his son. Unfortunately, both him and Broly would end up stranded on the Planet Vompa until Freeza and his men would learn about them.

He was implied to be shot at point blank range. One can come to that conclusion reasonably, but it happened off screen and he's set to appear in the MCU going forward, so probably not.

If a guy compliments another girl in front of his girlfriend, why would he do that? And what should she do about it?
He would do it because he thinks something about the other person was worth complimenting. He probably also, like most guys, doesn't think his girlfriend is narcissistic enough to take offense from a harmless compliment. He's dating her after all. There isn't much the girlfriend should do about it unless it was an overtly provocative compliment. If you meant the girl getting the compliment, she should maybe just say thank you.

I don't think this is true. Both Gogeta and Vegito go for the kill. Vegito is only cocky when fighting Boo because he wasn't trying to win. When he fights Zamasu he goes straight to business and doesn't waste any time. If anything, Gogeta is more cocky as he was perfectly able to destroy Omega Shenron in an instant, but he wasted his fusion time bullying him instead of killing him.

My half brother raped me a few years ago but I always pretended like nothing happened because my family loves him and I don‚Äôt think he knows that I know. What should I do?
How does he not know you know? Are you saying he drugged you? In any case, the truth should come out. You would be protecting other women from the same fate that you suffer now. Who knows, you may not have been the first or last victim of his, you speaking up may give others courage. Any consequences from telling the truth aren't on you, those would be the consequences of raping someone, so don't ever let anyone convince you that it is better to keep HIS secret. Seek therapy for rape victims if you really need guidance and advice about how to handle the situation, and move on with your life. I wish you the best of luck.

Even if you don‚Äôt see the symptoms yourself doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt there.She also might be dealing with a lot of stuff that she doesn‚Äôt necessarily want to talk to you about too.

You do realize you sound ridiculous, right? If you decide to move forward with a pregnancy with 3 babies, you keep them all, you irreparably damage them by ripping them apart and only choosing one because it‚Äôs more convenient. Either abort, or make it work, and keep all 3. It‚Äôs not that hard. Also, you don‚Äôt have to pay for college. They can work that out themselves if they decide to go, and community college is a great resource. I‚Äôll wait for another ridiculous comment from you, because I‚Äôm sure one‚Äôs coming. üòÇ

I'm pregnant with triplets. I'll give birth to them all but I think I can only take care of one. Is it wrong to give two of them up for adoption?
It‚Äôs absolutely wrong, and quite frankly, disgusting to do that. You should never rip multiples apart. They will always feel something missing and will find out what you did. If this is truly a real question, and not just some troll, you should feel ashamed of yourself for even thinking of doing this to your children. You can take care of all. Do what you have to do and make it happen.

My daughter's after school program is feeding her against my wishes. Do I have any recourse?
Your child is at school all day, probably only eats lunch by 12 or earlier, and is likely at the after school program til 5 or 6, and she‚Äôs not supposed to eat anything for that long after lunch? So basically you‚Äôre wanting her to starve. You should be ashamed of yourself as a parent. Hope they keep feeding her what is likely only a snack. Grow up.

How do I tell my 13-year-old only child that her dad and I are signing over custody of her to my brother so we can work for a job at a hotel resort in Canc√∫n, Mexico? It is a well-paying job. We‚Äôll come back in 7 years, if not more. She‚Äôll visit us.

I was spanking my 14-year-old son for coming home late and not doing his chores. He then punched me in the face and locked himself in his room. What do I do?
You assaulted him and got what you deserved in return. So many better ways you could have handled that situation. I‚Äôm glad I raised my boys right from the get go, so they don‚Äôt even stay out late and come home when they‚Äôre supposed to. He probably wanted to get away from you for a longer period of time.

I‚Äôm also 14, struggling with the exact same thing.
I wonder if it may be ADHD or something along those lines. Do some research on ADHD and the symptoms it has. That may help you out a bit.
If the things you are dealing with are severe, see if you can see a doctor, therapist, or counselor.

Is it normal for my 12 year old daughter to get upset when I pick out clothes for her, especially if they‚Äôre from children‚Äôs stores? My daughter is not a teenager yet, so I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs acting like one when she isn‚Äôt.
I was in the same situation when I was 12. Mom picked out my clothes and got them from children‚Äôs stores.
Look, your kid obviously doesn‚Äôt like the stuff you‚Äôre picking out, and she‚Äôs close enough to being a teenager, so how about you take her out shopping, even a place like goodwill or a secondhand shop would work! Then she can have her own style and not feel obligated and childish to wear the current clothes she has.

Do you trust your parents?
In short, no.
My mother, whom I should say cares a great deal for me, stresses me out like no other. I struggle with cleaning my room, but I feel the need to, mostly because she cleans it for me. This seems like a harmless kind gesture, but it I don‚Äôt trust her going through my stuff in my room.
I‚Äôve also gotten into a habit of bringing my phone everywhere I go, including the bathroom. If it needs charged when I‚Äôm getting a shower, I hide it the best I can. It‚Äôs like walking on eggshells. Can‚Äôt say the wrong thing or else all hell breaks loose.
My dad isn‚Äôt as bad, but because of my mom, it‚Äôs really hard to trust anyone. There‚Äôs more into it that I won‚Äôt mention but no, I don‚Äôt trust my parents.

Should I allow my autistic daughter to hold a stuffed toy while she's getting a shot? She needs one but I don't want her to bring a toy. She needs to keep her arms very still, plus it's embarrassing.
Yes, you should allow it. Some autistic individuals need support like that, such as carrying a toy with them. You should not be embarrassed by your autistic child. Whether you are a neurotypical adult or not, this is your child. Do what makes her happy and comfortable, whether you like it or not.

My parents got me help about a year ago, but I‚Äôm going through a relapse stage. They aren‚Äôt doing much of anything, but I don‚Äôt blame them, mostly because I don‚Äôt show external symptoms. Your daughter could‚Äôve been struggling for a while and is just now opening up to you about it. Of course, I am not aware of your entire situation. Just please get your child help if they ask for it. You could be saving their life.

Do schizophrenics (or people with schizoaffective disorders) believe the voices or other strange phenomena they experience to actually be real entities outside of themselves?
Yes I knew someone and she thought she was going to rewrite the Bible and she had an eye infection and thought she had witch craft in her eye. She was thinking God was sending her messages that she had to carry out and starting missing all of her other obligations. She had bipolar and must have stopped taking her meds because she wasn't like that previously. Eventually she went to psch unit and got help. It was scary. I feel really bad for these people because alot of them don't like taking their meds and don't realize they are in a psychosis. She was very aggressive when trying to get her help.

My teenage daughter says her dream is to buy a bus and make it a home, and travel instead of working. How can I let her know this is not realistic?
Ask her what her plans are in more detail. How does she plan to make money for insurance, gas, tax, food, and internet (more than likely from mobile)?
She could remote work, or pick up odd jobs where needs require, do gig economy jobs, or freelance online.
It‚Äôs pretty realistic from a start but you should show her that she should be aiming for less work, not none

if she had kindly asked for an iPhone, i would have said to look second hand and the end of their software support, or just out of support (like a by a year) as this would get her an iPhone, and at below $100, a reasonable compromise, and android even worth purchasing is going to be at minimum $150‚Äì200
however she acted like a 5 year old and essentially had threw a tantrum for not getting her way, so i wouldn‚Äôt even buy any phone after that, Encorage either to babysit or dogsit etc to buy one

Buying the cheapest brand new android is better for a punishment than a flip phone, cause while everything will work like a normal smart phone, it will be INCREDIBLY slow and borderline unusable, while a flip phone your expectations are more in check and its usually still a faster phone than the cheapest brand new android

Buy her the cheapest shit (but brand new) android you can find and say that she cant be trusted with such an expensive device right now based on what she did to the old one
If you want to get her hopes up, buy an empty iPhone box and put the budget android inside it
This will teach her to not destroy her stuff in hopes of getting better stuff

What should I do about my 13-year old daughter wanting to be called Jack?
You have a chat with them, see how they identify and respect it, educate yourself on transgender and/or non binary people if you havent got much (or any) exposure of them.
I would maybe even watch some YouTube channels with Jack like Jammidodger and you might even find something new to do together and be getting more insight into what its like.
PLEASE make sure that if Jack gets a binder that they only wear it up to 8 hours, and never when doing sports, since it does make it a little harder to breathe

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
What type of symptoms are you expecting to see ? Unless you are a mind reader you cannot tell what somebody's thoughts and feelings are and that's what mental health is. Nobody knew I was suicidal unless I told them. Let her see a therapist !!!! Believe your daughter, she is reaching out, she needs help!

What should you do? Are you serious? Even if she's completely neuro typical and has zero mental health issues it's still completely valid for ANYONE to see a therapist and in my belief EVERYONE should see one. Especially mothers who want to deny their children the medical care they are requesting. This should never have been a question. Whether you ‚ÄúbElIeVe"" her or not, get her help because that's your job. My mom did that to me and guess where I am? Almost 25 and just finally got my first real job because over a decade of trauma, depression, and etc mental illnesses destroyed me and my ability to function in any way a normal adult would. Do your kid a favor and actually support her and show her you care. At 18 they can do what they want and I hope she goes and gets whatever help she needs‚Ä¶

I would strongly suggest you get her that therapist. Most mental health issues are usually invisible. That‚Äôs why depression is called ‚Äúthe silent killer.‚Äù That‚Äôs why most loved ones are surprised when someone they‚Äôre close to commits suicide, because it‚Äôs something that usually isn‚Äôt visible. And most people on the outside see this bubbly and happy individual, but on the inside is a broken soul who is crying out for help. Since mental health is still widely stigmatized today. People have gotten better at hiding/masking the symptoms of various mental disorders. Since people are scared of reaching out of fear of resentment/rejection. Also you have to remember this is a mental health concern. Mental disorders are very hard to spot unless you do a lot of research or know what behaviors to look‚Ä¶

Buddy, After a couple of months I only just got my door back because I had to do counciling online and needed a private room. I‚Äôm surprised that my parents haven‚Äôt taken it off again by now. Having my door gone just showed me that my parents don‚Äôt trust or respect me. That damages a relationship between parent and child. Give your kid some trust and respect. Just sit him down and talk to him as to why that is wrong and he shouldn‚Äôt be doing those types of things as it could damage his body in the future. The only thing my parents taking my door off taught me was to be more sneaky with the stuff I do.

Hi. I‚Äôm 13 and my friend is 14. I was uncomfortable because she was drinking with 3 people I didn‚Äôt know at all(not even their names) and a usually very quiet place was very loud. I also have very bad anxiety and loud noises make me quite freaked out/scared as well as being around people I don‚Äôt know by myself. I don‚Äôt know why she has banned me really because she‚Äôs known me since I was 3. Although she does think at least I‚Äôm apart of the lgbtq(specifically trans, which she isn‚Äôt wrong about) but that was more toward the middle ish of the pandemic.

Hi, I have a friend of 10, going on 11 years and her mom doesn‚Äôt like me. I know she doesn‚Äôt like me because she thinks I‚Äôm trans and gay(which she‚Äôs not wrong about.) And on New Year‚Äôs Eve of 2021 she was drinking and 3 people I had never met before and a usually very quiet place was very loud so I was uncomfortable and asked my parents to pick me up(which they were completely fine with as they were already out and was in our general direction) and she got mad and said I could never hang out with my friend again(or at least at her house). I don‚Äôt know why she is acting like this since she‚Äôs known me since I was a toddler. Can anyone help me?

How do I know if I like someone? I‚Äôve been friend with this person for almost 2 year and they are a year older than me. I don‚Äôt know if I really like them or just because we‚Äôve been friends for so long I think I like him. I feel kinda fluttery when I talk to/see him. He also just got with someone and I don‚Äôt know if he would even like me(he is polyamorous). I get anxious thinking about whether or not he would feel the same and I‚Äôve had the beginnings of a anxiety attack before.

Please take your child to a therapist. I have issues and when I went to my mother about it she said I just wanted attention and I don‚Äôt have anything wrong with me. She knows I have depression and anxiety and I‚Äôm in counsiling now, but, that isn‚Äôt really helping with my other problems. She refuses to take me to a psycoligist or doctor to see if I have some under-lying neruological disorder. This has made me believe that I am faking and just want attention and that is really messing with me. I‚Äôve ‚Äúnever shown symptoms‚Äù but I do still believe there is something there. Just because symptoms aren‚Äôt shown doesn‚Äôt mean that there isnt something there. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to see. Be a good mom and take her.

What is the most beautiful place in the city where you were born?
Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. Inside the city limits, everyone knows about the casinos. The Bellagio is known for its fountains, and the Venetian for its canals. There‚Äôs even a casino modelled after Paris, with a model Eiffel Tower. But none of those are the most beautiful place in the city. For a place inside the city limits‚Äîperhaps ridiculously close to the Strip‚Äîlook at Springs Preserve. It‚Äôs a mixture of botanical gardens and natural history museums. There‚Äôs a butterfly habitat opened during some parts of the year, and you can walk about the trails, taking in all of the wildlife. I remember being astonished at how much could flourish in the desert. Now, if you were willing to travel a bit more‚Ä¶ I have to recommend Red Rock Canyon State Park. I simply must.

Do people with ASPD resent society or just don't care? Do they hate others or are just indifferent?
It would depend on the person with ASPD. People with ASPD have personalities. Some people - many of whom do not have ASPD - resent society or just don‚Äôt care. Likewise, there are many peope with ASPD who think society is beneficial, and there are many people with ASPD who like others. It definitely depends on the people and the situation at hand.

Are there levels to being a sociopath or psychopath?
No, not really. I mean, having a higher score on the PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist) could be considered having a higher ‚Äòlevel of psychopathy‚Äô, but‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre a psychopath, you‚Äôre a psychopath. You still have ASPD like all other people with antisocial personality disorder. It doesn‚Äôt really change anything except the severity of your disorder. I‚Äôd say there aren‚Äôt levels, because if you are a psychopath at all, it just means you have a more severe disorder alongside antisocial personality disorder.

Why do I feel like character I like? Not just ""a character"" but like characters I like from games, shows, etc.. I feel like it could be an identity disorder but I genuinely don't know.
Identity disorders are formed duing childhood due to intense childhood rauma. Unless you‚Äôve had intense childhood trauma, you likely do not have an identity disorder. Rather, you likely connect with the characters, or perhaps they remind you of yourself or soeone you like. Often, people mirror traits of those they admire; this could be an instance of that.

Do sociopaths have multiple personalities?
A sociopath might be diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, in which case they might have multiple personalities in the clinical sense, but generally it‚Äôs not multiple personalities but just different masks shown to different people.

Are we all sociopaths of some sort?
No.
To explain, sociopathy is a diagnosable disorder and a subtype of sorts of the diagnosable personality disorder Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). People can show sociopathic traits, but not everyone is a sociopath, which is characterised by low or no empathy, callous and unemotional traits, impulsivity and dislike of authority, among other things.

Is it possible for a sociopath to not be narcissistic?
Yes - sociopathy is caused by Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) while narcissism is Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). While both have high rates of comorbidity, plenty of people with NPD do not have ASPD, and plenty of people with ASPD do not have NPD.

Why is a southern accent so incredibly annoying?
I used to live in Nevada, but my family moved to the South a few years ago. I have a more plain American accent although I use slang like ‚Äòhella‚Äô and say some words in a way that might be considered different from the norm. My mother is a native Southerner, and we don‚Äôt get along so well. Her accent is strong. People have a lot of misconceptions about Southern accents.

Living in a red state here. A woman and a minor. My state has a trigger ban that does not make exceptions for rape or incest - if I were my parents, I would move northwest a bit to where there are actual protections for abortion.

However‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm luckier than most of my friends in that my father is pro-choice and my mother would let me make the decision for myself (the decision being to travel to another state, and she would probably cover the costs).

When you would ask a narcissist if he/she is a narcissistic, would they say yes?
It depends. A narcissist is a person with narcissistic personality disorder. They may be unaware that they have said disorder, in which case their answer would likely be ‚Äòno‚Äô. However, if they are self-aware, they might say yes.
This also depends on how the person wants you to perceive them. People with NPD generally want to be liked and/or admired, so they may not admit to having NPD if they think it will make you admire them less.

How do you feel about people who take birth control?
Anyone who takes birth control is doing good things for their health. Not only can it postpone an unwanted or unneeded pregnancy, but it can also help with problems like anaemia or the ability to take other medicines. Birth control can also help slow the progression of endometriosis - another point towards birth control.
People who take birth control are just people, the same as you and me, but there‚Äôs nothing else differentiating them from people who don‚Äôt take birth control save for the fact that they might be healthier in the long run.

Why do so many Americans hate their own country?
For the younger generation, America isn‚Äôt quite what it used to be.

Gen Z in particular - and perhaps millennials, too - dislikes what this country has become. We see what we will have to deal with in the future. The economy is crumbling. The politics are polarized.

How can I support my partner with his trauma/mother wound? He won‚Äôt seek professional help or family/friends for support. He acknowledges the destructiveness after the fact but falls into self sabotaging patterns. How can I help without a shrink?
Hi -since he's in agreement then you're half way there- and we don't need a shrink all the time. any small detail would help me answer this question,ok? In a very few, maybe 1 word, how was he traumatized? My 1st thought is Emotional Incest but I could be way way off

I agree with all of the above what Hilliri said and would like to add that you revisit and reevaluate every 5 years or soso. Make the decision ongoing. This is a big choice .

What do you say to a sister who has cut off contact with her family?
A.‚ÄùEveryone loses.‚Äù Please, not to sound flippant with you. I have family estrangements all over the place. In my case, none have come back. B.You could ask her to deeply reconsider the long run, the big picture such as when relatives start dying off. C. But I hate to say it, everyone in the family would do best to prepare for the worst, grieve her loss and let go. Such a cliche, who wants to believe that? D. One of a few real life examples: After my most recent estrangement, who was my daughter, separating my 3 year old grandson from both him and me in the process, my therapist gave me the above advice and I didn't want to receive that, but now that it's 3 years later and he's 6, that little guy has forgotten I exist, and my daughter is apparently happier without me, and during these 3 years‚Ä¶

Someone I know very recently lost their partner to cancer. Soon as I found out, I went out and bought flowers, and a card, and I left it at their door. It's been three days and I haven't had a thank you or anything. Is that a bit rude of them?
You said it's still there. Do you mean still there at the door where you left them? Could it be that no one has opened the door yet, so your friend doesn't know they are there? Either way, no, I don't think that 3 days is long enough to expect any acknowledgement yet, given the devastating circumstances.

What is the opinion of people who have written letters about their psychotherapists after termination of treatment?
That's such an interesting idea. I don't know what people think about people who do this, but I think it's a really good idea. Even really good, helpful therapists have failed us miserably in certain ways over the years and I think it's therapeutic in itself to get those things out in this way. I'm going to do this. I'm on the verge of breaking up with my therapist of 8 years. This is a good way to get out the issues I now have with him. I'll never send it to him, because he's done so much more good than harm, but I can address the failures, times he didn't hear me,times he didn't take me seriously in the last few years, how I think his advanced age has deteriorated his ability to continue to work and why I have to move on.

Plotting revenge and seeing how you can outshine them sounds very much like a person who is still enslaved. Plus, you didn't at all answer the question. This response from a professional is so bad that it's scary, unless your response is an inappropriate joke‚Ä¶ I'm staying far away from you.

Why is Turkey still an undeveloped country?
Same reason why Europe was underdeveloped during Medieval times: Religion and Religious Dogma. Simple as that.

Why is Medieval Europe so popular for fantasy books, movies, games, etc. as opposed to other cultures or time periods, such as Ancient Rome or Egypt?
I think main thing is there is indeed lots of different fantasy time periods but people don't think of them as fantasy. One other thing is people are used to the classical Medieval Europe fantasy, when someone writes a Greek fantasy book everyone gets mad that it's historically wrong as if there really were wizards, dragons, druids, elves etc. in middle ages.

Yes, it's mostly genetics. Like with every part of one's body. You can never overcome genetics with workout. That also applies to rest of your body, you might build lots of muscle but still look thin, you may have a shredded waist yet it might still be thicker than most people. However you can still improve your hands strength and maybe its look aswell. There another problem arises: What even is a manly hand? Is it having big hands? Then you simply can't achieve that. Your hands will grow bigger as you grow older as hands never stop growing untill you die. However it will happen so slowly that you probably won't realize it. Is having manly hands having hands that have lots of veins? That's much simpler, hand workout will give much more pronounced veins. Any workout will make your hands look more veiny. Is it having lots of those ‚Äúbones‚Äù at the back of your hand? Then it has nothing to do with hand workout, if you live in a colder climate and you haven't protected your hands very well those bones will fade away, as they're not really bones. If you want more boney hands simply wear gloves and keep your hands moist at all times. So yeah it's mostly genetics, with influence of lifestyle. Yet you can make some improvements how little they might be.

If Batman had to fight each of the original 6 Avengers with no prep time and meets them on the spot, when would he lose?
Batman without prep time is nothing but a rich furry obsessed with his bat persona so he'd lose to half of them quite quickly. Hawkeye and Black Widow are more likely to lose, as Batman is‚Ä¶ well Batman. He might be still human but so are they however Bruce has incredible intellect, stronger body and higher tech gadgets which just gives him the edge. Captain America might be more his equal in fighting skills as Captain doesn't know much technique compared to Batman but still has a body much more stronger than his, however Batman‚Äôs suit kinda would protect him enough in this case and considering Cap only has a godly strong shield and no other protection he has openings which Bruce wouldn't hesitate to utilize.

Are there verses in the Quran which make more sense in Aramaic than in Arabic?
Well, rarely but gen‚Ä¶
So we know, Quran is at least mainly Arabic. And it seems like kinda of a big deal isn't it? Well, that would be correct. Have you ever tought why, Muhammad is called ‚Äúummi‚Äù even tough he clearly is written a book by himself (yes, he wrote it by himself. It's stated in Quran that who wrote the book is prophet himself). Well the thing is this word meant ‚ÄúOne who doesn't know Aramaic‚Äù. Because Aramaic was the only language the holy books were available back in the day. And day, ones who doesn't know about religion were also called ‚Äúummi‚Äù for the very reason. ‚Äúummi‚Äù. But since at some point Muslims decided that it was wrong the prophet didn't believe in an Abrahamic religion for a while, they have changed it into ‚Äúone who doesn't know how to read or write‚Äù. (Like another word which was changed: ‚Äúhanif‚Äù which at the time of Prophet clearly meant ‚Äúpagan, worshipper of idols‚Äù later changed into ‚Äúbeliever of true religion‚Äù)

Well, rarely but generally no. First I gotta explain some stuff, like every religion Islam got forged into what the nation wants at times. And alltough I don't believe that the scripture itself was changed, the translation was always changed and is changing still to this day. And where book isn't enough, the rumors that are were created only to serve a purpose of bending the religion as wished wished. Which makes it extremely hard to know what actually is historically true, what is not and where exactly did all this happen? The real physical evidence from first times of Islam in history is so little. So when it comes to Islamic history anyones word can be better than other.¬∂

whatwould you suggest I do when my stepdaughter comes to visit her father And I and her mother consistently calls, text and now FaceTimes. It feels very intrusive. her mother and I got along great, but have since become bitter because of the circumstances. I was anxius having my stepdaughter again because I haven‚Äôt had her since and the last time there was no FaceTime. I‚Äôd never stop her from coming of course I‚Äôm always excited to see her, but I was just anxious about what may transpire. I knew it would get under my skin. And it did and I angrily said some thing to her father loud enough that I‚Äôm sure she heard so I know that her feelings are hurt and she‚Äôs upset with me, but we were all supposed to be taking a trip together in our new airstream camper together to her cousins wedding on her father side. She‚Äôs 18 going on 19. She mentioned it first that she had told her mom that she could only text five times a day and call twice and I thought oh boy that‚Äôs great. I was really happy that she was taking an initiative with her mother, but that didn‚Äôt last long , so I feel it‚Äôs partially her fault but I feel bad for my stepdaughter because her mother really has some issues and I do feel bad for her as well but it‚Äôs causing a problem with our family because I ended up not going on the trip and I‚Äôm going to meet them by flying and not joining them in the camper. But my luck I actually was sick maybe stress? I don't know, anyway plane fare this late will be astronomical. Nonetheless I really want to go and this is a really big deal for me to travel with my little dog so wish me luck.

You're suppose to be a supportive parent and take her to see a professional.
You aren't in her head, you don't know your child better than they know themselves.

The ‚Äòpleasure‚Äô he gets is his literal freedom to live. He can have proper hygiene and safety. You can't blame a human for wanting to live without suffering, he has long enough. You should blame those who forced that man to endure such hardships for so long.

I wish people would stop harassing famous people over their sexuality. Unless they ask you out, it's got nothing to do with you. Find representation in people that are officially out and stop bugging everyone else. üòí Thank you for the post.

Is it sexist to help women?
Of course not! Keyword is helping and not doing for us. Always ask before you intervene and never take the entire burden on unless asked.
I'm at a physical disadvantage compared to my male twin whose taller, stronger and has a bigger build. Its nothing to be ashamed of. If a man offers help you either accept it or decline politely. Don't assume it came out of pity or because he looks down on you. No need for defensiveness and nasty remarks. This makes men avoid people like me struggling, to save us the embarrassment. Please please please help me carry that heavy box, I'll be grateful!

So the new generation is, according to you, now responsible for apologizing for what happened before they were born? It's ridiculous how you expect so much from the children when they can't even genuinely admit to anything. Do you expect a nationwide apology in their parents and grandparents behalf? From my American classmates, I was nicknamed a Nazi, isolated in history, demonized and called a dictator because I was born in Germany. I had an Italian-American best friend because she could understand what it was like not being able to be proud of your heritage without people only seeing the war in your history. Nevermind the fact that my mother suffered under a dictatorship in a foreign country. Or that my gay brown ass wouldn't have been treated like royalty during the war in Germany either. Yet I have to carry the burden and apologize as a German citizen, years after everything?

It's not weird at all, I totally understand what you mean! My brother admitted to me before that this is difficult because skinship like hugging or piggybacks make you ‚Äúgay‚Äù to everyone else and that embarrasses a lot of guys even if they're confident in their sexuality. It's sad because I'm female and can easily do these things with my all my friends without judgement.
Reversed, I wish I could hug and cuddle friends of the opposite gender without us automatically ‚Äúdating"" or being in love with each other. I have good male friend and we have zero romantic chemistry but can talk forever about small things and laugh a lot together. I sometimes want to just give him a goodbye hug or be sentimental without people thinking I'm flirting. I know it can be embarrassing to him too, especially if he has a crush around.
I hope society will be more accepting to things that are labeled ‚Äúgirly‚Äù , ‚Äúgay‚Äù or strictly for couples but really are just platonic desires of friendship. We're social creatures who like contact, it's in our nature. One day..

I have a good relationship with my mum now and still find this creepy myself. A baby monitor is there to make sure a child is safe and healthy or not choking, etc. Unless this boy has life-threatening respiratory issues why even put one in? That would make ME uncomfortable and I used to share a room with my brother.
Around 7 years old I had an alarm system attached to my door because my twin and I would steal snacks/sweets or wake up and watch tv during the night. It sounds ridiculous because I understand we misbehaved and it was to alert our parents to scold us. Even as troubled as we were, we NEVER had cameras/monitors set up in our room because they believed in privacy even as children. The alarm idea went sour very quickly anyway after our bladders forgot all about our pantry raids.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Your daughter can be experiencing mental health decline a different way than you imagine it, so it's understandable that a seemingly happy child like her can all of a sudden break down and ask for help. Having these emotions bottled up inside so long isn't good and it takes a lot of bravery to show this much vulnerability to someone close, especially if it's so bad that she feels she needs a professional to talk to. Do NOT brush this off as ‚Äúoh, she's a teen, she's going through hormonal changes"". Please take her wishes seriously. Not everyone who is depressed will self-harm or have anger outbursts. When I get really angry and cannot control my outbursts, I break down sobbing and crave sleep. It's often mistaken for me being sensitive or just having a bad day when it's stress building up so‚Ä¶

You should believe her. You should want to reward her a) prioritizing her mental health and b) asking for help.

Why do so many younger people not want to work?
Laziness. I see comments online and in my life where people complain they‚Äôre working a 9‚Äì5 job. My response is it must be nice having a dedicated start and end time to their schedule. Some of us are actually on call 24/7, even if it‚Äôs 2 am and you got home an hour earlier. And no, that‚Äôs not a joke. If you like working incredibly long and hard hours become a lead paramedic and be dedicated to your job.

I'm 14 years old. How do I convince my parents to let me get a small tattoo?
the best thing to do is wait. the tattoo you want now you will probably regret or not even like as much in the future. so much changes and you develop a lot of different interests. you‚Äôre only 14, if i got the tattoos i wanted at 14 i‚Äôd be embarrassed. at 15 i did a bunch of stick and pokes and i regret every single one of them and have covered up them since. when i turned 18 i finally got a professionally done tattoo to cover up one and i don‚Äôt even like it as much anymore and im only 20.
it would be so much more better to simply wait.

My teenager got caught getting food at 1:00 AM. What should I do?
My parents were the same way. Because of it I developed an eating disorder and when I would get food in the middle of the night it was because I had a headache and my doctor told me that to help make them go away I should eat something. Now I keep a snack box beside my bed because I have trauma over it because if one of my siblings would eat something in the middle of the night and my parents found out, they would go on a witch hunt and integrate us till someone spilled and force that person to do things like wash my parents feet for them. I recommend not punishing kids when they are hungry because if you do itll likely lead to resentment.

My 16-year-old daughter‚Äôs friend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. Am I wrong for prohibiting her from being in contact with us anymore?
Have they been friends for a while? Dose the friend ever incited a dangerous situation? If they've been friends for a while and the answer to the last question is no then she should be able to contact her friend. Having a diagnosis doesn't change you that person is still the same person they were before the diagnosis. It is a cruel thing to keep your child away from a friend because of a diagnosis. It's like parents who think autism is bad and contagious so they keep their children as far away from them ad possible. By keeping your daughter from this friend its showing her you don't have much compassion and therefore she doesn't have to show compassion in the future. She will also likely resent you for keepin her from her friend.

There are a lot of things I couldnt tell my parents so they never knew my pain. Thats why they didn't believe me.

This question bothers me not only as a parent but also someone who suffered in silence with mental health and is now finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel after almost two decades of depression and anxiety. You damn well go and do exactly as she asks! You had already answered your own question - my daughter asked to seek a professional for mental health! As a parent you take that seriously not question her behaviour, your attitude definitely makes me question how long you have had your blinkers on to not realise your daughter needs help. As a fellow parent, I know my child‚Äôs life is worth far more then the extra cost of them needing to see a medical professional for a medical reason.

Sometimes you have no fault as to why cops are involved with you. Perhaps the person is having issues with property destruction / theft/ violence from someone else - we do not know the reason as to why police are involved. It could be a completely innocent reason on the behalf of the poster.

That actually depends where you are, ie; country and situation. In Australia, as a culture people are scared of guns. Most people only ever see a gun on the side of a police officer/ certain security/ military. This means it‚Äôs something people can go a long time without ever seeing. Besides those sources, any guns we heard about it see are related to bad things and we see on the media, so it‚Äôs understandable that guns would make people uncomfortable.

I am not from any affluent area and don‚Äôt qualify as even being middle class by wealth standards , but rather by manners / dress etc here in Australia. Our gun laws are very very different, NO ONE open carry‚Äôs except police, certain military in very certain situations which is very rare and occasional certain security who all have very special licences.
I am by no means against guns, I myself until covid competition shoot and also for pest control. But if I was to see someone open carry anywhere it would freak me out and make me uncomfortable, because it‚Äôs just not done and it‚Äôs just not legal in Australia - regardless of where I was in the world.
We also have far less gun crime and gun accidents due to our laws. So whilst you wish to judge someone for not liking that people choose to open carry, realise that where they come from they may not see it or even have it something that‚Äôs legal, so they haven‚Äôt grown up where it‚Äôs normal so they feel comfortable around it. People may wish to not want guns around their children as well; because of their own negative experiences in the past, that should be respected and tried to understand rather then judged.

Can you learn to draw without anatomy?
You can if you're not drawing characters or any figures representing a human like figure because if you are then you'll probably have a hard time drawing said figures. But you can still learn to draw without having to be anatomically knowledgeable. Architecture is an example of such drawings without the use of anatomy. Instead, you'll be using geometry to sketch out buildings and shapes. Just in case, if you're thinking that cartoons don't have anatomy, you might want to retract that thought. Though they look wacky, they do have anatomy as well.‚Ä¶

As an artist, what do you do if you have lost interest in drawing?
In all honesty, I don't think I'd be able to do anything about it.
Although, I do think that this is some sort of process. Maybe look at others art and be inspired to draw? Perhaps you need to take a break from drawing, go out into a park (albeit still following health and safety protocols because the ‚Äòrona is still on the loose), enjoy the scenery, have tea/coffee/chocolate (whichever you prefer).
Perhaps you can also convince yourself in drawing by buying art books to teach yourself (or maybe just going on libgen if you don't have money, not that I would advise it but it's your choice)

Just because she's never shown any symptoms does not mean that you shouldn't, at the very least, consult a professional regarding about it. If anything, it's best that you do have a professional verify whether or not your daughter does indeed have any mental issues; even more so when they're reaching out for help, which is done lesser than you can imagine. This is a rather serious topic that's misunderstood and scoffed at, being said that it's only in their heads, that it does not exist. To say that it does not exist is tantamount to challenging years worth of studies performed by various researchers over the years; something that needs to be tested first for verification before it is published.

My son watches anime. How do I tell him that it's only for little kids?
The assumption that anime is only limited for children is naught but an incomplete truth.
Anime is intended for a wide range of audiences; that means there‚Äôs anime targeted for children, while at the same time, there‚Äôs also anime intended for more mature audiences, ones who do not need parental guidance when they witness violence/gore, NSFW, etc.

What is the best way to learn how to draw?
From what I have experienced first hand, The best way to study many drawing lessons is via Kinetic Learning. This means that you have to copy what they are doing whilst you are taking lessons. This learning method works best if said lesson is presented via video such as Youtube or Skillshare. Once you have done so, try tweaking your newly acquired skill so it goes along with your art style then keep on repeating on doing the skill on order to finally make it yours. (AKA P R A C T I C E since at the start, that skill hasn't developed that much. I mean, it has been engraved into your brain but only temporarily. You have to keep repeating it to make it yours.) Along the way, you might get bored. You might think to yourself that this is the only thing that you've been doing. Just remember that you‚Ä¶

How can you improve your drawing skills?
First of all, Practice. Start off Fresh! If you happen to be drawing Characters, then it's a good idea to try and draw the body first before the expressions but its probably even better to give time and practice one at a time. This means that when you finished a practice session for one area, Try the other and vice versa! (That way, you won't end up with a huge skill gap that took too much time just to fill in like I did.) Secondly, Do not use draw using a continuous line. What I mean is that in drawing your rough sketch, Use short lines and curves to mark or ‚ÄúRough out"" your sketch! Thirdly, DO NOT GIVE UP! Whatever you do, you must never give up as a Drawing Artist. That means you mustn't allow yourself to be discouraged to draw. One of the things that can make you discouraged is when you co‚Ä¶

If you could master any instrument apart from the piano or guitar, what would it be and why?
My ideal instrument would be The Violin. As to why I'm going to learn to do the violin, the violin had played a part in orchestras and accompaniments with other instruments such as the piano. Other than that, it has a good tone that literally speaks sophistication. And when violinists play a heartbreaking orchestra, the violin delivers the mellow sadness straight into the hearts of the viewers. Another reason is the feeling of belonging. My family plays string instruments. My cousins play the guitar. I had also played the guitar as well but I immediately had withdrawn because I preferred classical instruments like the piano than a modern instrument like the guitar itself. I played the piano because it had tones that ranged from the bold and loud to the gentle and mellow but I feel as if I do‚Ä¶

What do you do if someone likes you, but you don't like them back?
I‚Äôve been on both sides of this situation and let them know how you feel about them (you care about them, you find them kind) to let her know she‚Äôs not just a person to you. If you really don‚Äôt know her well just let her know. That would give her a hint of why you don‚Äôt like her.
If you guys are close just be honest and don‚Äôt offend her. And the biggest thing to do is treat her the same way you did before. Still being mindful of course.

As someone who's young and has been tested for mental health issues and illnesses, just atleast go to a doctor or therapist. I was embarrassed of saying anything and when i did it took a while to handle. I fell into a really dark time by myself. I felt so lost, suicidal, depressed, alone, and all i wanted to do was to talk to someone. My counselor helped me IMMENSELY. I wouldn't be as good as i am today without being able to express everything. Now if she is comfortable with telling you a lot of information, please take everything into consideration and don't make your own assumptions like 'your not sleeping enough' or ' it's all online'. You just need to watch it very carefully and don't gaslight her. :)

I am just 14 years old. And I had my first kiss with my love and we are in relationship. He is 19 years old. Is it right what I am doing?
I‚Äôm sorry but that is not love. First of all he‚Äôs a pedophile. He‚Äôs playing you. If he really loved you he would keep a huge distance between you two and have no contact. If he was really in love with you he would‚Äôve waited patiently at least 4‚Äì5 years for you. We think we are full of maturity, but as we grow older (even if we grew one year older) we realize that we were dumb and so immature. You just never know when you have the full maturity, but at 18+ you‚Äôre responsible for your own actions. Now at this age you can‚Äôt let yourself do anything you want. You will fall under a deep rock and you won‚Äôt know how to get out of it. Instead learn how to discipline yourself. Don‚Äôt let yourself do anything you want. I‚Äôm sure you know what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong. So discipline yourself and don‚Äôt e‚Ä¶

What the hell. No offense but that‚Äôs your fault that she hasn‚Äôt shown symptoms to you. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden‚Äù!? You should be the first one to believe your daughter. I have no hate towards you but what you said is disrespectful and very immature. Are you living in her head? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs not your place to believe it or not. Your place is to get your daughter all the help she needs.

My 14-year-old daughter got mad when I told her she had to sleep in my room for a week to let her uncle sleep in hers. She is now ignoring me. What should I do?
I‚Äôm 14 myself and I understand how your daughter is feeling and I also understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I mean I think you should let her have her own room. Especially at 14 a lot of different things are going on in the mind. She needs privacy. Even one night can be important. It‚Äôs hard to explain how a lot of things are changing. Try to make her understand you didn‚Äôt mean to take her room. Tell her you just couldn‚Äôt tell her uncle to sleep on the couch or something. I also think it‚Äôs kind of weird that he is sleeping in her room, but again that‚Äôs only my opinion!

Narcissists do not care about anyone but themselves. They do not care if they hurt you. They do not care about anything or anyone unless they can get something from them. Narcs don‚Äôt have empathy. They simply don‚Äôt care. Narcs will also cheat on you with anyone and anything they can get into bed with. 99.9% of narcs cheat whether you think they do or not, they do. Also, narcs cheating is also extremely premeditated. Narcs don‚Äôt only cheat on impulse (although they do that too). Narcs will have relationships with multiple people at the same time and not think twice about it. I found out that my nex had 4 of us at one point but the reality is, it was probably even more than that.

what should you do? You should listen to your child and get her the help she obviously wants and needs. I am a social worker and I also suffer with my own mental health struggles. I suffered in silence for YEARS because I was embarrassed. This is why there is such a stigma surrounding mental health issues. Just because you don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù symptoms, doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt there. You should be SO proud of your daughter. Do you know how many kids and adults don‚Äôt say anything and go on to hurt themselves, or worse? You are causing so much more harm by invalidating her experiences and feelings. You don‚Äôt get to decide you don‚Äôt believe her just because you don‚Äôt see symptoms. I really hope you did not tell her you don‚Äôt believe her. If you did, you‚Äôve caused even more harm and will make it so sh‚Ä¶

You look beautiful- nice enough for a bridal shower or as a wedding guest. If husband doesn't like it, tell him to talk to his boss about a big, fat raise. As far as the young, spoiled woman, she has a very limited, shallow life, and therefore nothing else to talk about besides boutiques. You could reply with, ‚Äúoh dear, those places are so overpriced. I prefer to be frugal and donate to worthy causes‚Äù (it doesn't matter if you only donated a few bucks at Christmastime, or donated clothes.) You need to be proud of your life, and could have talked about things she doesn't know about. Do it with confidence and she might have found it interesting. You may have found common ground somewhere: cats, puppies, movies, tv programs, family‚Ä¶ You can talk about your childhoods, schools, vacations and day trips. His response to your exit could have been, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not feeling well‚Äù.

The Mexica tribe settled in the area and predates the US by at least 800 years. The country of Mexico gained their independence from Spain in 1821. About a third of the US belonged to Mexico until the war 1846‚Äì48. Anyway, I hope you're kind to your Mexican-American neighbors, because their ancestors were indeed in California first.

Blame your MAGA Congress. Enough Republicans liked Biden's border/Ukraine package enough to pass it, but Trump got into the MAGA speaker Johnson's ear and told him NOT to bring it up for a vote, to save it for him pending his election. MAGAS will bend over and kiss his üí© ass in the hopes that their loyalty will give them more power. In the meantime, Ukraine is falling. Do you think Russia will stop there? Next will be Poland, and being a NATO country the US will be obligated to send troops over there. Sending money to Ukraine to stop the spread of Communism is much more preferable. Trump should not be allowed to get involved at all. This is not his administration.

üòë You're so far behind, I don't know if there is any hope in changing your mind. Try avoiding watching Fox and others who filter what you see, in an attempt to make the Republican candidate look good and the democratic one look foolish. Filter, edit, spin‚Ä¶ Try watching YouTube podcasts: Rachel Maddow, Brian Tyler Cohen, MeidasTouch, Legal AF, John Oliver‚Ä¶ Also look beyond these two men and see how our Congress acts- the most unproductive one in history. The loud mouths make stuff up and get facts wrong (Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert‚Ä¶) You have grown men challenging each other to a fist fight. Utterly ridiculous. Jasmine Crockett is a rising star. She sets the record straight. The Republicans‚Äô speaker Mike Johnson is refusing to put Biden‚Äôs Mexican border/ Ukraine proposal to a vote because Trump doesn't want him to‚Ä¶ because it will make Biden look good. Interest rates are the lowest in history under Biden. Joblessness is super low, especially among minorities. I voted for Biden because he was VP under Obama, who had an admirable reputation. Trump bragged he could grab women by the pussy. I couldn't vote for something has no respect for women, and has no ability to conduct himself professionally. Trump wants everyone to believe he's a hotshot billionaire. That's proving to be false: several bankrupted businesses, people he hasn't paid for services, ‚Äúowns‚Äù many properties (how much of it is actually equity?). Can't come up with cash for his bond? The guy is a grifter and snakeoil salesman. Compare their speeches. It's no wonder Trump refuses to participate in a debate. He can't keep a thought together, meandering from a serious subject like NATO, into a word salad about golf. He doesn't understand the importance of NATO and has said our loud that Putin should do what he wants. He admires dictators, and is a racist - compares his problems with those of black people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being indicted and discriminated against like you‚Äù. His discrimination against them goes back for decades. Mexicans are not coming over in droves from prisons and insane asylums as he‚Äôd have you believe. He uses scare tactics about foreigners, exaggerations of abortion, and believes he should be immune from prosecution. Who would ask for that, if they weren't guilty as sin? MAGAs have a plan to take over the country. Look up and read Project 2025. Vote for Biden. Our democracy depends on it.

Take her to a therapist. It's not ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù, despite you feeling it is. She has probably been feeling ‚Äúoff"" for some time, and worked up the courage to ask for help. You ‚Äúdon't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms‚Äù. Are you a professional? I'll tell I you, as a person with depression and anxiety, we can hide it really well, and run on autopilot, but it eats away at us until we can barely function. She may have issues she feels she can not talk to you about, or can barely put into words. If you were physically sick, you wouldn't just ignore it and wait for it to go away. Get over the ‚Äústigma‚Äù, and help her find and take her to a licensed therapist.

Every time my daughter goes with her father and brings back items that were purchased by her father, my husband (her stepdad) throws them out. He makes up all these excuses to have them tossed in the garbage can. What should I do?
Make him stop. Assert yourself. The bio father had a right to maintain a connection with his daughter. Stepdad must be feeling somehow threatened by the prospect that she might love her first dad over her second dad. He needs to get over it. First dad didn't divorce the child.

First of all, you should be so damn thankful for your daughter opening up to you and reaching out for help. So many people just suffer in silence which is the worst way to be, feeling like you have no one to turn to. Secondly, EVERYONE deals with issues differently. Simply because she hasn‚Äôt been showing symptoms, doesn‚Äôt mean she hasn‚Äôt been suffering with it. And lastly, you are in absolutely no position to tell wether she‚Äôs telling the truth or not, unless you have a degree in psychology. Little do you know, you won‚Äôt take Not taking her seriously and could have serious consequences including her mental health could get even worse, meaning she would be in such deteriorating and falling into a bad place, she wouldn‚Äôt bring it up again.

If this sadness is corelated to a particular incident that recently happend in you life which involves a loss it cud be part of the grief process.
If not and this sadness has been prevailing for quiet some time and it has began to interfere with your personal and social life i suggest that you consult with a mental health practitioner..

What is the worst mental illness to have?
You cant really rate the worst and best diorders to have. It doesnt work like that , a lot of other factors play a role in determing that like
The kind of person you are..
The family support you have..
The culture you grew up ..
And these are just the few
It varies from person to person.

A lot of people with mental illness keep their symptoms hidden for fear of being judged.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Greetings,
I think you must consider taking her to a therapist, since she's feeling low. She's never shown any symptoms doesn't mean she never had any. Maybe she's holding back her feelings, or too scared to share them with parents. Try talking to her peers about how she behaves while she's around them. It'd be better if you yourself talk with her and try to understand her and make her feel better before meeting a therapist. Upon failing to do so, ask her to meet the therapist/psychiatrist in private and let her discuss her problems confidentially.
Hope this helps
Thank you

Mental health issues are not always obvious, maybe she's been clever enough so far to hide everything that could look wrong, ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. Also mental health problems sometimes appear and are not there when you born .

She‚Äôs coming to you in comfort asking you for help. I think a parent should never question whether they do have issues, each individual struggles with something. Allow her to get help she wants. üòä

We have a pretty good relationship other then his past ones that some what effect ours. This is my first ever and in 23 he's 25. Healing takes time but we have a pretty awesome relationship but you communication is lacked. It was one of the boundaries I have ever put in place was him not seeing Rachel alone after him and the only fans incident but am I being unreasonable? We nearly broke up multiple times about it because the first 3 days was him saying I'm overthinking and natw was there but I was right? I've never actually had a feeling like this before. How would y'all respond? I'm pretty kind and relax. And try have convos but he will just hide in the room all day acting sad like I was the one who lied haha? Like help relationship such

Me and my partner have been together for over 2 years. Recently my partner lied about hanging with a girl alone while his partner was at work even tho my bf said he will be there. He didn't come home till 2 am. He lied then 3 days later I asked again and he told the truth. I saw the messages it was always gonna be just the two ‚Äúgaming‚Äù . I don't think he did anything but we've had the similar situation happen 3 times but with naked girls on snap chat and one on instagram. I love him to much but what do I do? Accept the fact he lied and just wanted to hang? Or? Like bro I feel heart broken

I‚Äôm not going to be accusatory or judgmental because I truly believe there is still a lot to be done about people‚Äôs understanding of mental health. If your daughter thought she was sick, but wasn‚Äôt running a fever, would you still have her go to the doctor just in case? Probably, because if she was, you wouldn‚Äôt want her to get worse being untreated, and you don‚Äôt always run a fever if you‚Äôre sick. Mental health is just as important as physical health, believe it or not, and we need to start looking at it that way. If your daughter thinks she is struggling to a point that she needs professional help, even though you don‚Äôt see her pain, it‚Äôs there-it‚Äôs an instinct to hide your emotions. So, you should believe her, just in case, because you don‚Äôt want it getting worse to the point of something‚Ä¶

My 2 year old boy was difficult to wean from baby bottles. It's like his security item. So I took my 2 year old boy to the dentist and he was so scared, he had a meltdown in the clinic. So they told us to go to the hospital instead. But i was very surprised that he put in our referral reason ""DEFINITELY NEGATIVE CHILD with bottle carries"".

Sometimes, it's not about the symptoms that we see. your daughter brought it up because she actually is asking for help. or maybe she needs someone to talk to. there's nothing wrong with seeing a therapist. remember, people who committed suicide once asked for help in a different way, and was ignored.

No one is extremely ugly in other people's eyes.. sometimes we are are our own critic. We may see ourselves differently from how others perceive us to be. Real people dont make friends based on how we look. They only care on how we treat them. But on the other hand, if they are your real friends, they'd tell you if your clothes are dirty or you got dirt on your face etc. ü§î

MORE CONTEXT:
I believe I have depression but my parents won‚Äôt get me diagnosed. I am a minor. I think an emotional support dog will help me a lot and I want to train one myself. Before you say something like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need one‚Äù or ‚Äúyou probably dont even have depression‚Äù I have been feeling this way for around 2 years and have went to the point of self harm. I have a dog and he helps a lot but he rarely even comes up to me when I am upset and when he does he just walks away. So I want to get a new smaller puppy and train it to be my ESA.

If democrats dropped the gun issue, most of my other views are fairly liberal. They haven‚Äôt been successful so far, but they‚Äôve made it clear that they don‚Äôt want citizens to have more than a shotgun or low capacity bolt gun. I‚Äôm not okay with that. We can go free healthcare, we can legalize weed, abortions for all, whatever. look at politicians like Beto and Bernie, and AOC, the trajectory of the party is clear, and I care about personal protection more than any of those other subjects. There‚Äôs room for better vetting, maybe we need to adjust some age ranges, and it‚Äôs abundantly clear we need a law requiring that any house that files taxes with dependents and owns a firearm has to have a burglary rated safe that firearms are stored in except when it is in direct control of the person who is using it for protection. I can‚Äôt vote for people who want magazine limits, semi-auto bans, or Californians weird pistol grip laws.
As to your other point, Quora sent me an email with this comment headlined. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre getting so much traction.

Is it morally wrong to not visit a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer's in a nursing home? What is the point of visiting if they don't remember you, or won't remember you ever visited?
It‚Äôs not morally wrong. The nurses caring for them sure feel bad about it, but what does it do for YOUR mental health? I went to see my Grandma on a snow day from school that shouldn‚Äôt have been a snow day. Roads were fine. I got there, she called me every name of every male in the family oldest to youngest until my cousin, born 5 years before me. That‚Äôs where her memory stopped. flashback: 3 years before that I was sitting at her kitchen table with her. Grandmas door was always open and you just come in and have a seat. Someone came to check on her because a vehicle they didn‚Äôt recognize was there. The entire time she stared at him with beady eyes of hate that I had never seen from my grandmother before, and after he left she confirmed as much and called him a pervert. flash forward: that‚Äôs‚Ä¶

I went through 1500 over (I knew I was over weight, pretty simple calculations.) got a 500lb ticket. Was surprised because it was California lol.
for my empty weight:
steers are 12.300 all the time with full fuel.
drives are 14500 (maybe a little less but I leave room for error) (I have a scale that works based on air pressure for these tires that I can see in the cab.)
trailer axles are 4K lbs ea. (this matters because I‚Äôm generally split axle)
When I go to a shipper and they tell me I‚Äôm loading at 48,000 lbs, I know my steers, I can see my drives on my scale, so 48klbs on deck it‚Äôs usually at 32,500 on drives, so 32.5‚Äì14.5= 18,000 added on drives
48k (load)-18k (of that load on drives) = 30k lbs on trailer axles. 30,000/2 = 15,000 per axle + 2,500 per axle for axle weight itself. So my total should come to 35,000 lbs Also, from experience I know the front axle loads 1,000 lbs heavier than the back, so the difference is 500lbs / axle in our final calculation.
so now our loaded weight is
steers : 12.300
drives: 32,500
trailer : front axle= 18000 / Back axle 17000
Double check the math for the trailer, 18000 + 17000= 35,000, so we know that‚Äôs correct.
Then we go to a CAT scale before any DOT weigh stations, and make sure we get a legal weight, because they pay your ticket if they‚Äôre wrong, or they hire an attorney to fight the ticket from DOT scales if the DOT scales were wrong.
Total weight 79,800
Now I generally have 48‚Äô flatbeds, so that calculation works for me. Changes a bit with stepdeck and 53‚Äô

Do semi-trucks ruin roads?
So the answer is yes and no. There are different ways to BUILD roads based on use case and soil compaction. On an interstate, while we wear them more, it‚Äôs largely the fault of the engineers/construction crew/government (available funds for construction) of developing pot holes, while on other roads that maybe weren‚Äôt meant to be frequented by that kind of traffic but rather much lower-tonnage vehicles, it very well may be, in part, a semi‚Äôs fault. A prime example is when our high school was re-built, we had probably thousands of HEAVY trucks back and forth on 2 roads that weren‚Äôt meant to handle that kind of traffic, much less that frequently, and they had to be replaced immediately after construction ceased. Now is that the fault of the trucks or drivers? No. It was necessary to move those‚Ä¶

My 13-year-old daughter came home with a half sleeve tattoo. How would you handle this? I told her no, she did it behind my back. I'm so upset.
Assuming you are actually an irresponsible parent and not a 13 year old trying to figure out how much trouble you‚Äôre about to be in
A tattoo kit (with gun, ink, and power supply) is $47.99 on Amazon. A little bit of birthday money could get you started, so I‚Äôm inclined to believe this is possible.
take your kid in for an STD test. That‚Äôs what you do in that situation. You don‚Äôt know what kids it was used on, probably wasn‚Äôt cleaned right, or if any of them have something. I know we are talking 13, but one of my best friends was pregnant at 14, and clearly they‚Äôre hanging with kids that aren‚Äôt the best influences. Now get off quora and be a helicopter parent.

Have to agree with this one.
1- probably not an actual sleeve, but easy for a distressed parent to view it that way, and probably the forearm half
2- wasn‚Äôt a real tattoo artist, I can buy a tattoo gun on Amazon, not unreasonable to think it was a kid with a summer job or a few Amazon gift cards, also means it probably Wasn‚Äôt good
3- probably more outlines than fill

How much do semi-truck drivers make?
Highly individual. Company, lease, or owner? I‚Äôm out 3 months at a time and go back to my parents for 4 days at a time. I pull about 80k as a company driver and trainer. A solo lease guy could pull 80k/yr. I‚Äôll switch to lease trainer in the new year, a conservative estimate is 120k. BUT if I took all of the home time available to me currently (a day/week, though as lease in my company I can go home whenever I want, you still have bills though) we‚Äôd be looking more at 90‚Äì100k. 52 days makes a huge difference. That‚Äôll be 4 years of driving experience.

If a drone is flying on my property and I have already notified that I do not want it to be flying on it, can I destroy it without legal repercussion?
If you‚Äôre in the USA, drones are under the authority of the FAA. They‚Äôre an air vehicle. The consequences for shooting at the drone are similar to shooting at a plane. Understand that the remote operator is still operating under the capacity as an operator. You can file a complaint with the FAA, get a restraining order for harassment, etc. IF YOU SHOOT AT IT, you‚Äôve committed a felony. Legally you don‚Äôt own the air above the buildings or groundscape. It doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have rights though. A pilot can legally pass over your property, camera or not. Hovering over your property is slightly different. Keep in mind at 300 feet I can fly my drone straight above my property and see the back yards of all of my neighbors on my block. At 250 grams the drone has to be registered with the FAA,‚Ä¶

If she wants to see a therapist. I don‚Äôt think you should stop her. You can take her to a therapist, voice your concerns and let her and your daughter have a conversation with each other. Again, mental health issues are not just depression or anxiety. They can include stress, prolonged sadness, confusion and sometimes lack of safe space. Therapists are not psychiatrists hence they do not prescribe medication. If there is anything that is serious, they will report it to you. Often a lot of parents worry that therapists will put unnecessary thought into their child's head. If that is your concern you can check the background and experience level of the therapist. And take feedback from your child. As therapy space is confidential in nature. I think restrain from your part would be required to‚Ä¶

I was rejected by UCLA, UCB, USC, UPenn, Duke, and Northwestern, but was waitlisted by UChicago. Statistically speaking, does this make sense and what could‚Äôve gone wrong with my application?
Okay, so before I start, I think you should know how obsessed I was (am) with UChicago and it was legit my dream uni. I got rejected lol, but I am really rooting for you to get into UChicago at this point cause as far as I have researched, they look for a blend of quirky and genius. The good news is that they really found the unique blend in you and they look forward to having you at the uni so congratulations! It is an achievement in itself. As far as your application is concerned, I‚Äôd say it is about what the colleges are looking in you and not how you present yourself. My application was perhaps very straight forward and not very creative in a way but I still managed to get into a better ranked uni than UChicago, because that is what the college was looking for - MEHH kids with good acad‚Ä¶

I am 18 years old and I hate being an Indian. My parents are very controlling, and I hate being with them, but I am financially not stable. I want to move out and fly somewhere. What should I do?
Alright, so here‚Äôs the deal. I am 18, want to move out as well. Before even I start to list down the requirements, here is the primary requirement to move out at 18- COURAGE.

It all starts with one goddamn thing- CONFIDENCE. Build up some confidence, get out of your comfort zone. Try talking to people who are better than you, smarter than you, and more efficient than you. Make sure you don‚Äôt surround yourself with people who are afraid to dream big, who backbitch, who gossip, waste their time, are into negatives like drugs and stuff. Change your company and be with people who truly make you happy and comfortable (the ‚Äòcool‚Äô kids in highschool aren‚Äôt going to be cool forever, so don‚Äôt go for that. Sometimes that one silent kid with the hoodie on all the time is the coolest person you‚Äôll ever meet).
You‚Äôre 80% there when you are more confident and comfortable and the rest 20 lies in how your personality is like. Be kind, dress better, look sharp (you look fine to me right now, but if you‚Äôd want change, then go for better fitted drips, and a smarter hairstyle maybe) and just be respectful to people. Be chill.
Also, drink lots of water, work out often, maybe even play a sport or smthg and have fun!
Hope this helps!

Listen up. I am 18, just opened up to my parents about seeking therapy too. This is too coincidental. Here is the deal: Firstly, kudos to your daughter for opening up about this, it takes courage. I have been holding back from opening up and when I finally did, it felt SO GOOD. You should be glad that she chose to tell you and not do something stupid with her life (iykyk) that she would regret later. It not necessary for everyone to show symptoms, you have no idea what people go through even when they seem completely okay. Be glad about the fact that your daughter atleast told you about this and for god‚Äôs sake please don‚Äôt be sus. BELEIVE HER. People don‚Äôt lie when they are in pain.

First day of college today, I was hella insecure. I looked like a potato the entire day with my hair like Dora the Explorer. Thank you for this post, acceptance is something WE ALL need. I haven‚Äôt met a person who DOESN‚ÄôT wish to change a thing about themselves. We forget how much our body loves us and that it is trying so hard to keep us alive and healthy while we continue to point out things that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúperfect‚Äù with our bodies. Your body loves you, love it back :)
I really appreciate how you embrace all of your body, which I believe each one of us should at least try to. Because in reality (unfortunately), every human is insecure about something or the other; some make it seem obvious (which is completely fine) some conceal it (also fine). Everyone is fighting their own demons inside of them so lets be kind to everyone and accept ourselves as well as cease to judge others. Hey stranger whoever is reading this, YOU‚ÄôRE FREAKING BEAUTIFUL!!!

How important is age in second language acquisition?
It is really important and I will explain why. Learning a second language as a toddler is easier because you learn how to think in that language. When you are an adult trying to learn a second language, all the information that you incorporate about it goes through a translation process that starts with your mother tongue. This can be changed once you get enough resources to develop thinking skills without translation steps, but it is certainly easier to fully incorporate languages if you don't have to overcome that. Learning a language as an adult can be more difficult than it is for children, but there are other things to consider. Age, together with environment, abilities, and habits will make your language learning process easier or harder.

What is the best way to deal with a public tantrum of a 2-year-old (lying on the floor kicking and screaming for not getting their way)?
One day I was taking care of my niece and I started a google search trying to find ways to deal with her tantrum. I tried the first tip that I found because I didn‚Äôt have time to scroll to the bottom, and it actually worked.
First, try to hold your kid. Yes, it can look like an impossible task, but just make your best to hug them or at least take their hand.
Then, start talking to them and ask them questions about their tantrum while showing that you understand their sadness. If they are crying because the wanted a toy, you can try something like ‚ÄúI understand that not getting that toy can be frustrating, but we can not get it now. It makes you sad, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
I was amazed when my niece stopped crying after a while.

What are the possible distractions brought by phones to young learners?
Social media and its notifications. The urge to answer any message and check any update even when you are focusing your attention on something else. Also, meaningless scrolling on platforms that we enjoy tends to be more enjoyable in the short term. There are many applications that block your phone for a specific period of time so you can achieve your goals without distractions.

How does first language influence second language acquisition?
When you learn a second language later in your life, your brain ‚Äúthinks‚Äù using your first language. This means that, if you don‚Äôt try to change that default behavior, you will translate everything in your head going from your first language to the second one.

How can I learn English fast and easier at home?
If you want to learn a language fast, you have to take advantage of the 20/80 rule.
Google:
-Regular plus non regular verbs.
-Pronouns.
-Curse words.
-Simple tenses (Past, present, future)
-100 most common words.
-20 most common expressions.
-Propositions/connectors.
-Questions.
Now study all these for a month and understand how they work as an structure.
This represents 20% of any language, but this 20% it is used 80% of the time. It gives you a strong foundation to start trying to understand movies, books or any type of content that you can engage with in order to keep learning.

A teenager is a person aged between 13 and 19 years. In less than a year, your daughter will become a teenager. It won‚Äôt really make much of a difference.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
The fact she came to you at all with her problems is something you should be thankful for! Not all of us get the luxury of confiding in our parents at that age. I certainly didn‚Äôt. You are not in her head or her body. How are you supposed to know what she‚Äôs going through? She may be having symptoms you cannot see. She may even be hiding them from you because she doesn‚Äôt want to hurt you. And how do you know you aren‚Äôt the problem? Parents do the best they can with what they have, but children are still going to have trauma somewhere along the line. No parent is perfect and no childhood is perfect. Wouldn‚Äôt you rather her get the help now? Get her the therapy! And, do your own part. Read up on mental health so you can support her. Doubting her and dismissing her is going to ruin your relationsh‚Ä¶

There's a couple things you've said that is making me feel worried that you may be going through some postpartum depression or need some extra support.
My main concern right now is for your daughter. You can't 'force' her to be quiet. Secondly‚Ä¶ she's a week old.. meaning that if you've left her alone for four hours that's neglect. And it's abusive to 'let her cry it out' - newborns will eat anywhere from every 2 hours to 4 hours‚Ä¶ she needs to be held and cuddled and loved. And with how much she's supposed to be eating, she probably needs her diaper changed as well.
There's been studies that prove the cry out method doesn't work. It makes a child feel unsafe and can create personality disorders later on in life‚Ä¶ where she won't develope empathy -
I'm hoping that this is a troll question‚Ä¶ because my heart breaks for this helpless little girl who can only cry to tell you something is wrong. Unfortunately there ARE people like this in the world.
You should be having a followup appointment pretty soon with the nurse and dr.. please express your concerns and how your handling them. Call 911 if you're feeling out of control or having thoughts of harming her - do not shake her - or toss her down roughly - please ask a neighbour or a friend for some help - or call 911 and tell them you think your baby might need to be checked out and explain she's shrieking after 4 hours in her crib - they will send someone out and give you some support. ü´∂ü´∂

How do I tell my 9-year-old foster son that we will be adopting his younger half-sister, but not him (he'll be removed to a group home)?
Coming online to ask this question makes ME question why are you even foster parents in the first place!? For real. This is so hurtful and abusive.. makes me sick. ANSWER: UMMMM.::: 1: adopt them BOTH is what most ppl say..: but SERIOUSLY!!!! U not fit to have children who need extra love and safety in your home. 2. *PLEASE** DO NOT ADOPT either of them. OR foster them. I‚Äôm so shocked!!!! Like,. What!! U want a younger little girl.. and not the sightly older brother for a family dynamic!!? This boy IS part of your family. You don‚Äôt explain ‚Äòwhy‚Äô‚Ä¶ keep the kids as a pair.

I think this is a girl who knows it‚Äôs wrong and doesn‚Äôt have a mom who is either capable of sticking up for her and advocating for her‚Ä¶ Or didn‚Äôt teach her proper respect and boundaries and if the mom has no idea what‚Äôs going on, it just sounds like a really messed up bad household maybe there‚Äôs alcoholism and drugs or God knows what‚Ä¶ So worst case scenario I think we should have a cat and take it is the truth and give her proper advice. The rest of us adults understand how wrong it is and how disgusting and how we would love to just kill this piece of shit paedophile goof, however as a daughter who of course loves her father‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of psychological bullshit especially if it‚Äôs a broken home that goes along with it.
I wish I knew who this kid is because I‚Äôd be there in like as long as it took me to get there I guess there‚Äôs so many kids but I end up with lifelong fucked up issues because some perverted piece of shit is a total creep and how many other children has he abused

We don‚Äôt know her family dynamics‚Ä¶ The mother could be condoning it or even blame her‚Ä¶ I think she needs to go and speak to the police which can hook her up with a professional. To make sure she‚Äôs safe because of course she loves her family and her parents she doesn‚Äôt want anything bad to happen, but the guilt and shame an uncomfortable Ness she‚Äôs feeling right now is intense. It‚Äôs questions like these that make me wish I knew where the people were living who asked them‚Ä¶ Because if it was somebody in my town I would get involved‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had a lot of my daughters friends live with us over the years‚Ä¶ Or just be a safe place to go‚Ä¶ It breaks my heart this makes me sick on so many levels.

I'm 15. My dad will touch me and do stuff to me that's not appropriate. He asks me if I'm okay with it and I say yes, but I don‚Äôt know if it is normal. What should I do?
Sweetheart‚Ä¶ This is absolutely not normal. I know you love your father, but what he‚Äôs doing is completely wrong. I know it can be confusing because it feels good and you have love for him‚Ä¶ But what he‚Äôs doing is sexually molesting you and not only being a pedophile, but it‚Äôs incest. I would like you to go talk to a school counselor, and a doctor, and Parents, I want you to talk to you as many adults and tell everybody that you can to make sure that you‚Äôre safe and protected, because much more damage could be done than leaving it how it is or by telling someone who doesn‚Äôt believe you. 10 years from now you‚Äôre going to look back and be so relieved if you follow my advice.

Please hook her up to see someone.
she‚Äôs reaching out and asking for help. You‚Äôre not a professional, and it‚Äôs not your place to judge or diagnose. You‚Äôre lucky she‚Äôs coming and asking for support- so please, from one mother to another,. Don‚Äôt hurt her trust by judging her and/or downplaying what YOU believe about her mental health.
Please just make her an app and support her. You‚Äôre incredibly lucky she trusts you enough to ask and reach out. You have no idea what‚Äôs happening in her head‚Ä¶ so if you would rather have a dead daughter (or fucked up/addict/high risk) please encourage her and support what‚Äôs going on with her and assist her with providing professional support.
I feel nauseous and worried that you have to even ask. Seriously- drop the judgement and make the call she‚Äôs asking for.

My sister told me that my our dad was doing annoying things to her in the night. She also told me that it wasn't tickling, it was ""other things"". Should I be concerned?
If you have to ask‚Ä¶ the answer is ABSOLUTELY FUCKING YES!!! Sounds like she‚Äôs being molested and your dad is so in the wrong. I don‚Äôt know how old you are.. but for the love of God‚Ä¶ your sister trusts you and is reaching out. Please tell an adult (more than one‚Ä¶ and not just your mom) call a child crisis number in your area. And teachers.. counsellors.. tell your friends parents - and just call the police (you‚Äôre allowed to do that) ‚Äî‚Äî but this sits so uneasy with me.
‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt get in trouble‚Ä¶ and to act and acknowledge your sister and what she‚Äôs saying is more important than anything- seriously- trust me on this. It‚Äôs better to advocate for your sister than to keep your mouth shut or not say anything- when you‚Äôre older you‚Äôll be more than sorry if it‚Äôs what I believe it to be.

My father did this all the time to me as a child he didn‚Äôt believe me because apparently, I hadn‚Äôt shown any symptoms. however, you don‚Äôt understand how much it takes for kids to tell their parents how much they‚Äôve been struggling.
most times, depression is very easy to hide and that‚Äôs why a lot of suicide cases go unnoticed.
PLEASE for the sake of your daughter's mental health, let her see a therapist.

Can vaping cause cancer?
Legacy TBI acknowledges the ongoing research regarding the potential health effects of vaping, including its association with cancer. While vaping eliminates many of the harmful chemicals found in traditional cigarette smoke, such as tar and carbon monoxide, it's essential to recognize that vaping is not risk-free. Some studies suggest that certain chemicals present in e-cigarette vapor may have carcinogenic properties or contribute to the development of cancerous cells. However, the long-term health implications of vaping, including its potential role in cancer development, are still being studied.

Vaping without nicotine can be a personal choice for some individuals, and it's essential to understand that while vaping without nicotine eliminates the addictive substance found in traditional cigarettes, it's not entirely risk-free.

Civil engineering and architecture are closely related fields that involve designing and constructing buildings and infrastructure, but they have distinct focuses and responsibilities. Civil engineering primarily deals with designing, constructing, and maintaining large-scale infrastructure projects such as bridges, roads, dams, and water supply systems. Civil engineers are responsible for ensuring these projects' structural integrity, safety, and functionality. They use principles of physics, mathematics, and mechanics to design and analyze structures, considering factors such as load distribution, material strength, and environmental conditions.

Architects are responsible for designing the layout, form, and construction of buildings, considering factors such as safety, sustainability, and aesthetics. On the other hand, if you're more drawn to enhancing the interior spaces of buildings and focusing on elements like furnishings, color schemes, and lighting, interior design could be the better fit.

Certainly! Here's the information without the bold formatting: While people typically cook food, there are instances where the term ""cook"" is used metaphorically or in non-food contexts. For example: 1. Books: People may use the term ""cook the books"" to refer to manipulating financial records or accounting figures, often for fraudulent purposes. 2. Ideas: In a creative or brainstorming context, individuals might talk about ""cooking up ideas"" or ""cooking up a plan,"" indicating the process of developing or formulating concepts. 3. Drugs: Unfortunately, the term ""cooking"" is sometimes associated with the illicit production of drugs, particularly in the context of homemade substances like methamphetamine. 4. Data: In computing, the term ""cook"" can be used metaphorically to describe the processing or manipulation of data. For instance, someone might say they need to ""cook the data"" before presenting it in a certain way. 5. Books or Stories: Writers and storytellers might use the phrase ""cooking up a story"" to describe the creative process of crafting narratives. It's essential to note that these metaphorical uses of ""cooking"" are not literal food preparation but rather expressions used in various contexts to describe different activities.

Why do British homes have washing machines in the kitchen?
Certainly! Here's the information without the bold formatting: The placement of washing machines in kitchens in British homes is a cultural and historical norm. Several factors contribute to this practice: 1. Limited Space: Many homes in the UK, especially older ones, have limited space. Designing a separate laundry room might not be feasible in smaller homes, so the kitchen serves a dual purpose as a space for cooking and doing laundry. 2. Plumbing Considerations: Plumbing and water supply connections are often more easily accessible in the kitchen.

Is chicken breast bad for gut health?
No, chicken breast is not inherently bad for gut health. Chicken breast is a good source of lean protein, which is an essential component of a healthy diet. Protein is necessary for the body's growth, repair of tissues, and overall function. However, when it comes to gut health, it's important to consider the overall balance of your diet. A diet that includes a variety of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other protein sources, is generally more beneficial for gut health than relying solely on one type of food, even if it's a healthy choice like chicken breast. Including fiber-rich foods in your diet is particularly important for gut health. Fiber promotes the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, aids in digestion, and helps prevent constipation. While chicken breast itself may not be a significant source of fiber, incorporating a variety of plant-based foods into your meals can contribute to a more gut-friendly diet. Chicken breast can be part of a healthy diet, but it's essential to maintain a well-rounded and diverse intake of foods to support overall gut health.

Is oil bad for our health?
The impact of oil on health is nuanced, and it depends on the type and amount of oil consumed. Not all oils are inherently bad; in fact, some can be beneficial in moderation. Oils that are high in unhealthy saturated and trans fats, such as certain hydrogenated oils, can be detrimental to health. These fats are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, as they can raise levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol). On the other hand, oils rich in unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, can have positive effects on heart health. Unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, may help lower LDL cholesterol levels when used in place of saturated and trans fats.

Is a good vegetable a healthy thing?
Certainly! A good vegetable can be considered a cornerstone of a healthy and balanced diet. Vegetables are rich sources of a myriad of essential nutrients that play pivotal roles in promoting overall well-being. These include crucial vitamins, such as vitamin C, which supports immune function, and vitamin A, which is vital for maintaining healthy vision and skin. Moreover, vegetables are abundant in minerals like potassium, magnesium, and folate, each contributing to various physiological processes within the body. Potassium, for instance, helps regulate blood pressure, while folate is essential for cell division and the formation of DNA. The fiber content in vegetables is another noteworthy aspect contributing to their health benefits. Dietary fiber aids in digestion, promotes a feeling of fullness, and helps regulate blood sugar levels. It also supports the health of the gut microbiota, fostering a balanced and thriving microbial community in the digestive system. The colorful array of vegetables offers a diversity of phytonutrients, compounds with antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. This can contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases and support overall longevity. By incorporating a variety of vegetables into one's diet, individuals can ensure that they receive a broad spectrum of nutrients, promoting a holistic approach to health. Therefore, it is safe to assert that a good vegetable is indeed a healthy and nutritionally valuable component of a well-rounded diet.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
therapy does not require mental health problems first of all, so if she wants to go that‚Äôs all that matters. second of all, if she goes and it turns out she DOESNT have mental health problems then literally nothing bad will happen. i‚Äôm not understanding your concern. it seems like this is because of a deeper judgement, because like i said nothing bad will happen if you take her if anything it might help.

I want to convince my daughter to get an abortion because I am not ready to be a grandparent yet. I have so many years left to live before I want to feel old. What‚Äôs the best way?
The best way is to not do it. What you want and don‚Äôt want does not matter. Don‚Äôt want to be a grandparent? Fine‚Ä¶.let her love her life happily with her family while you miserably deny your grandchildren existence

Are you serious? You‚Äôre her parent and you don‚Äôt believe her?! You‚Äôre a perfect example of an unsupportive parent and should be ashamed of yourself. Not all signs and symptoms of mental health disorders are VISUALLY SEEN!!! A REAL parent who actually cares enough about their child to get the the help they need whether they see signs or not would actually know this. If you are not going to believe your child, then you need to give her to someone (such as a family member who is NOT LIKE YOU) who will believe her and care enough to get her help. I can‚Äôt believe people like you actually have kids. It angers me you are a parent and you are actually saying you don‚Äôt believe her! Mental health is NIT something to joke about!! Grow up!ü§¨

I think you might want to read an answer about a difficult daughter and how her life turned out. Many comments of that answer are similar.
How do I tell my 12-year-old daughter that I want to put her up for adoption? She's borderline insane and she's been in and out of psych wards. I cannot handle her anymore.

I am 16 years old. My stepmom does not let me wear makeup. All I do is wear mascara because I have white eyelashes and get teased about it. Today she said if I don't stop she will make me cut my hair and my eyelashes. What do I do?
Sit down and have a heart to heart. Understand her point of view why she doesn‚Äôt want to let you wear makeup so badly, then explain your side of story. If her reason isn‚Äôt valid enough, she should understand and let you go through with it. If her reason has some valid point, this method will help the both of you find a compromise. If her reason is truly ridiculous (deemed by a 20+ adult), get help like the other answers suggested.

I‚Äôm a college student that recently got accepted into a research project about gallbladder cancer. My professor said that first, you need to find extracts of something, such as canabis, tomato, or whatever. In that said extract, you need to know what substances there are, then test them in at least 2 types of cancer cells (same type of cancer can have different cells in different persons) to see if the substances have the ability to kill cancer cells. This step takes less than a month. If they can, you have to find the mechanism at molecular/genetic level.
The problem is most substances that can kill cancer cells can only do that at high concentrations, and high concentrations in vitro can multiply into very high concentrations in vivo (in cells) in order to treat cancer in humans. High concentrations lead to side effects. Therefore most substances that we find that can kill cancer cells just stop at preclinical trials of drug development.

First of all, don't think that you know your children more than they know themselves. You are not with them 24/7. I have a friend (currently more than 20 years of age) who had put a knife by his neck and prepared to execute a suicide more than 50 times throughout 8th and 9th grades. I am the second person who knows of this (his family knew nothing) as he recently told me. I hid eating disorder from my parents. Even my older sister who sleeps in the same bed as me didn't know much. Luckily, when I told my mom, she took me to a therapist. The last example is my sister. She's suffering from mild depression. She cried everyday and I only know some of the days. I listened to her vent and used an account the university gave me to let her video call a therapist for free. She met a doctor for other‚Ä¶

You Smell Like a Baka
Honestly, I've loved listening to Î∞©ÌÉÑÏÜåÎÉîÎã® for the past 5 years, but recently I started to realize how uninterested I've gotten in them. I still like their songs, but I find myself listening to other groups rather than listening to Î∞©ÌÉÑÏÜåÎÉîÎã®. I'll skip over their songs to listen to like twice, or BP. They made me happy for the time being, but so much has happened in my life that I'm just not interested in them like I used to be, and they're not something that takes my pain away anymore. It's always refreshing to start liking new groups, getting their albums, etc.

Be honest. If you knew Jungkook and he was obviously attracted to you and attempting to impress you, would you date him?
Yes.
Jungkook fits all the standards I'd like to find in a guy one day, and his personality appears to be a kind and generous one.
I know a lot of people may say, ‚Äúoh! Well that's just his personality online. You don't know how he is in real life.‚Äù
Everyone has a different personality type whenever they're online or offline. Just because Jungkook is nice and generous on camera, doesn't mean he isn't in real life.
Jungkook just feels like the definition of ‚Äúhome‚Äù to me, and that's what you want to find in someone. Someone who feels like home away from home.
With that being said, I hope Jungkook finds his love one day and they will treat him the way he deserves. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Is Jungkook pretty or handsome?
I feel like he's both. Jungkook is definitely one of my celebrity crushes, and it's either he's drop dead gorgeous one day, or so freaking handsome the next. Honestly, to me, before he got all the piercings and tattoos, he looked adorable at most times. Maybe because everyone still viewed him as the baby of BTS, but at the same time, he's a grown man who wants to be viewed as one. (I would add photos but Quora is being weird so you're gonna have to trust me lol) Compared to how Jungkook looked before and after, there's a slight difference. Don't get me wrong, there was definitely times when Jungkook was cute with his piercings and tattoos, and when Jungkook was very handsome without them. However, his piercings and tattoos just added to his handsomeness. Jungkook will forever be adorable in m‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been studying Chinese for years now, but I felt like I didn‚Äôt really understand anything, and now I wanted to quit to focus on my native language, but my parents and friends told me to continue studying. what should I do?
There's nothing wrong with wanting to focus on your native language, nor is there anything wrong with wanting to focus on learning Chinese. What I would do personally is (if I have time) work on both languages and study them. Even if you never truly understand all of Chinese, at least you're willing to learn and there's nothing wrong with taking a break from it for a while.

I've been dealing with depression on my own for several years now. I overheard my aunt and grandma saying that it was an excuse. It wasn't until someone had to TELL her that I was depressed did she actually think about it, but even now she let's it go over her head and what's done is done.
If she wants to see a therapist, take her to one. Her life is more valuable than your opinions.

She‚Äôs most likely ever shown YOU any symptoms. Listen to your kid, stop acting as if you know them better than they know themselves. Acting that way is not going to make your kid more comfortable talking to you about said issues, it‚Äôll make them hide it more.

What's the quickest way to learn Arabic?
As an Arab myself, I didn't know how hard the language was until I saw other people trying to learn it. My tip is to learn the alphabet then try finding an app or book or teacher to learn Egyptian Arabic since it's the dialect everyone who speaks Arabic will understand. You'll slowly be able to understand other dialects, it was a struggle for me too when I came to the uae. As for the morrocan darija, don't worry about it many people don't understand it.

She knows herself, take her to a therapist. My parents have always thought I was the perfect daughter that ‚Äúnever suffered from depression or anything like that weird stuff‚Äù as they put it. I used to go on really strict diets (throwing up food after eating it) and they never noticed, I self harmed a month ago, they never noticed. They still think I'm the perfect daughter they had even after I told them to take me to a psychiatrist.

Are most people in the younger generation depressed? What do you think could be the reason behind it?
At least the ones you see on media. In general theis generation probably does have a higher depression rate however it is impossible to list all of the possible reasons here as you could right a novel on it. In my opinion my main factors are,
Ill equipped parents or bad role models
Being forced to ‚Äúgrow up"" much faster due to heavy problems being shoved in their face. Even though they mentally are not ready or developed enough (in most cases)
The negative effects of social media
Lack of adequate sleepüòÇ

Why does my ex-husband say nasty things to upset my daughter and not my son?
That's a very broad problem, there could be a plethora of reasons why he is doing that. it also depends on your situation, how he grew up, how much time he spends with each of them, ect. The only thing i can say for sure is that its obviously wrong. In fact it your son should stand up for his sister if he notices this behavior and if ex husband gets along with him. And ofc if the ex is not a man who is safe to tell that then you should probably distance yourself far from him or get a restraining order. order if necessary. A very case specific question like this might not be best to ask on Quora.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I will be more sound in my reasoning. Instead of not believing her instantly try asking her what's wrong first, open up to her and let her know she can trust in you, then you can have her go see a therapist. If she doesn't tell you or won't open up then don't get mad but find a way to bond with her to where she feels comfortable telling you while she is doing therapy. Also she is 18, legally you can't really do anything. The biggest thing is make sure the therapist is a person who will not unnecessarily prod or try to indoctrinate her to any view no matter what that view is. This isn't som you should really asked the internet anyway.

Let her see a therapist. She shouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúshow‚Äù symptoms of anything in order to be able to see a therapist. There‚Äôs plenty of people that didn‚Äôt show ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù and yet still committed suicide. Mental health is a spectrum, if someone says their mental health is bad then that‚Äôs what it is. Only person who‚Äôd know that is them so again‚Ä¶ take her to see a therapist

Young women are especially prone to social pressures. Anyone with a lobe between their ears understands how modern society puts people ‚Äòstruggling‚Äô with disorders on a pedestal. It is a similar phenomenon as Munchausen Syndrome, but your daughter could also be seeking social status with this behavior. Mental Illness is the norm these days, so she could also be seeking conformity. The best way to deal with this is by cutting off whatever manipulator is feeding her these ideas that being sick in the head is cool and dissuading her internal feelings of inadequacy.

I don‚Äôt know your daughter and I don‚Äôt know you so I‚Äôm not gonna pretend like I do, but if your daughter feels the need to see a therapist I think you shouldn‚Äôt even think twice about it. I don‚Äôt know why your daughter want to see a therapist but I think it‚Äôs a good idea that you let her. Some people who suffer from depression or other mental health issues (such as myself) are sometimes good at hiding what you call ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù. Hell some people don‚Äôt even show ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù of depression or other mental health issues. I think you should have a talk with your daughter as well, don‚Äôt talk just listen and be there for her if she wants you to. If she hasn‚Äôt told you about anything it‚Äôs probably because 1. She doesn‚Äôt trust you or she feels you don‚Äôt trust her. 2. She is probably uncomfortable tell‚Ä¶

My narc ex sent me flowers. Should I thank him?
No. Do not thank him. I broke up with my ex who has narcissistic tendencies when he started lying and gaslighting me after 2 years of bliss. I knew the anxiety was not healthy for me and I knew he was finally showing me who he really is. I was always kind to him or ignored him, as it is not in my nature to be mean regardless of nasty things he‚Äôd said to me. I tried to maintain a pleasant relationship, because I am very close with his daughters. However, when a random girl texted me saying he cheated with her and started asking me questions (I did not respond), I asked him to tell her not to bother me. He was awful to me and accused me of making it up (until I sent the number). He had finally pushed me over the edge. So, I sent a long message outlining every single flaw of his and then I immedia‚Ä¶

First of all, you don‚Äôt need to be mentally ill to benefit from therapy. It encourages emotional intelligence (with the right therapist of course). Secondly, you may not know what your daughter is really going through or feeling. She may hide it well. If she had the maturity to ask for help, let her see a professional. If you don‚Äôt, you may regret it down the road and she could end up resenting you. In fact, many people who commit suicide seem extremely happy beforehand.

I am a dog lover. I have a rescue dog, who I house trained in 2 weeks flat when he was 3.5 months old. My soon to be fianc√© has a dog who shits and pisses everywhere and growls and bares his teeth and climbs all over the furniture including the nightstands. He barks constantly and has destroyed the inside of my brand new car. I donate to pet shelters and charities and have fostered many dogs. I also have a start up for pet products. However, this animal is purely an asshole and I can‚Äôt stand him. He‚Äôs gone away for months for training and nothing works. My boyfriend loves him, but works too much to properly train the animal (a miniature pinscher) and I would love nothing more than to not deal with this creature.

Yes. Twice.
The first time, the guy who asked me out was so rude to the waitstaff that I didn‚Äôt even want to be associated with him. It was not only a huge turn off, but embarrassing and I felt so badly for the people working hard to serve us (they made no mistakes). I politely excused myself and told him why, left some money on the table, found the waitress, apologized to her, tipped her and left.

Who do you hate right now? Vent here.
No one is important enough to hate. If you hate them, they win, because you‚Äôre spending time & energy on them.

Why did I find birth control in my 17-year-old daughter‚Äôs bag? Should I call the cops?
Uh, I don't know. Maybe to regulate her period? Help ease period cramps? You know birth control helps with that right? It doesn't just help not have kids. And like, 17-year-olds are sexually active sometimes. Would you rather your 17-year-old daughter get pregnant? And why were you going through her bag? Does your 17-year-old not deserve privacy? That'll get her to cut you off.

Which is the better game, Fable 2 or Fable 3?
Easy, Fable II. It works well with the first game. Lore is more together, example Wraithmarsh, Bloodstone, all those kinds of things. Also I like the story more but that's because I love the three other heroes as in Fable III I only love maybe two of the characters(Ben and Walter, also I hate what they did to Reaver-). Don't get me wrong I love Fable III but it feels like it doesn't fit. I like the ties from the first to second game. The first and secknd game go together so well while the third one feels like it's own game not connected to the other two despite being closer to the second game than the second and first.

Hi, what the actual fuck? I hope she tells someone and you both go to jail. What the actual fuck is wrong with you? SHE IS FIVE! A MEER CHILD! This better be some sick fucking joke.

Take her to see a therapist. Just because she ‚Äúhasn't shown any symptoms"" does not mean she has no problems. My mother and my grandmother did this to myself and my mother and both of us ended up incredibly ill. If she thinks she might be you should take her to see someone.

What is the best old video game you still play today?
Deus Ex: Invisible War is a fantastic piece of video game history. It‚Äôs got a cyberpunk espionage theme, and there are multiple ways to approach each mission. I‚Äôve played it enough that I attained all 5 endings. It‚Äôs got high replay value, at least for me. I just wish it could have gotten a sequel to it.

Why do some people become so obsessed with video games or other forms of entertainment?
The same could be asked of anyone who asks or answers questions on this site. Developing an obsession is just part human nature. The why, though, one handles those obsessions is another matter entirely.

What is the best multiplayer game that you can play with your friends only and no random people?
Left for Dead 1 and 2 are a good multiplayer experience. You and three other friends must go through various stages full of zombies, figuring out the best route to the exit. All the while, the group must search for resources they may need later. Otherwise, it‚Äôll be harder to attain a firearm.

What do ‚Äúnerf‚Äù and ‚Äúbuff‚Äù mean in gaming?
‚ÄúNerf‚Äù is a term used to cut back a character‚Äôs ability. For example, robbing Spider-Man of his considerable strength, and saying he‚Äôs only about as strong as a heavyweight lifter would be nerfing his strength.
‚ÄúBuff‚Äù is usually a reference to something like gaining a special item or trait. In DnD, having a Bard cast something like ‚Äúinspire‚Äù, for example, would buff the group‚Äôs stats in a certain way.

Why do people criticize video games that get PEGI 16 in the same fashion as PG-13 movies?
Depending on the story, such as a Deadpool movie, it would affect the story itself. With a character like Deadpool, a PG-13 movie doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. The character is violent, curses or makes inappropriate jokes every other sentence, so censoring much of what he does or says would essentially rob the character of their on-page identity that he‚Äôs so famous for.

Honestly, the first WatchDogs game. As good as the overall story was, for me personally, no mission after the intro ever matched it in intensity. Even the spider-mech digital trip was more exciting than a couple of the main story missions.

Is 30+ too old for a person to play video games?
Not at all. I‚Äôve made a living writing about video games. I‚Äôve spent a collective $100 on video games in the last 5 or 6 years, $60 of that having been a game I bought as a gift for my wife. Depending on how one works it out, playing video games can be extremely lucrative.
That being said, one shouldn‚Äôt spend the whole day playing video games, while there are other obligations. If every necessary chore has been finished, and there‚Äôs nothing else to do, playing games are fine. Besides, half the games that exist now might require someone in that age range to understand a couple of the social situations in certain video games.

I hope your kid never visits you. You're an awful parent who does not deserve your child's love on any level. May he find somewhere that treats him with actual respect and dignity.
You better hope he bothers to claim you when you're a stiff on a table.

You should have thought of that before making the promise. Don't feel like keeping it? YTA. My parents did this to me multiple times, and I never forgot. I guarantee your child will never forget. And if you break big promises like this consistently, he will grow to hate you. And I wouldn't blame him.

If your child is seeking help from you, please provide it. I‚Äôm 18, I have depression and anxiety. When I told my mom she instantly got me help, fast as hell. Just because you don‚Äôt see any symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs not battling it alone. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for some children to even come forth and say that they are going through such and such. This should even be a question at all. GET HER HELP! She asked you for a reason. And I applaud her for doing so because it‚Äôs not easy at all. I believe your daughter and so should you. I struggled with telling my mom, but soon I told her and she helped me, you should do the same for your daughter, and I‚Äôm telling you this as an 18 year old myself. GET YOUR DAUGHTER SOME HELP.

Is self-blame a symptom of depression?
Yes, it is. I have depression and I blame myself for things I shouldn‚Äôt and I find myself apologizing all the time for things I shouldn‚Äôt even be sorry for. It gets overwhelming because then you start thinking everything bad that happens is your fault and it‚Äôs not. I had to realize that so, it is a part of depression for sure but I went to a group with people who did the same, and we all came to an understanding of why we do these such things. I still go through depression but blaming myself and always being apologetic, that‚Äôs gone for sure.

Anytime I made a little science joke he would get furious, which confused me because it was SCIENCE JOKES.

even if you're her parent, you are in no place to believe/not believe her when it comes to mental or physical health. get her checked and get her the help she needs. if she turns out to be okay, then good. no loss for you (except money maybe). but if she turns out to be not okay, your action will just make her distrust you and not willing to open up to you. yes you don't lose money but you lose her trust, you make her worse, you contribute to the pain she feels.

How can you go into Costco without a membership?
A few things, like prescriptions in the pharmacy or an eye exam with or without glasses, you can purchase. But the easiest way to get stuff at Costco is to go with a friend who has a membership. They‚Äôll let you in if you‚Äôre going with someone who has a card. This is because they want someone to see why it might be worth becoming a member, and they know it‚Äôs often inconvenient to plan one‚Äôs shopping trips around a buddy.
In my state, one can‚Äôt go to the gas pump or liquor store without scanning an active membership. But I can tell you that even getting gas there regularly pays for the membership, as I drive my deceased grandmother‚Äôs SUV.

How do I tell my 9-year-old foster son that we will be adopting his younger half-sister, but not him (he'll be removed to a group home)?
First, start by correcting a misconception in your own head: it‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs not good enough for you, it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre not good enough for him. Well‚Ä¶ either of them. Second, get ready for the host of issues your adopted child has as a result of the separation. Imagine the therapy she‚Äôll need, not only as she is separated from her sibling, but as she takes on guilt that belongs rightfully to you. Imagine her falling apart as she learns more about what her brother has endured, from the rejection of a family he thought he was part of to falling behind her trajectory. You might not love him, but she does, and it can be hard to watch people we love get hurt over and over again, or to not know what becomes of them.

If you see a police officer chasing a suspect, and you tackle that suspect, will you be charged with interfering in a police investigation, or something of the like?
You probably wouldn‚Äôt get into trouble with the cops, but the suspect could theoretically press assault charges against you (which might or might not hold up) or sue you in civil court for any injuries caused. Citizen‚Äôs arrest is a thing, but so is the litigiousness of people, even if they‚Äôre doing the wrong thing.

My 22-year-old daughter wants me to babysit her 3-year-old without paying. How do I tell her I won't babysit her child without getting paid?
My wife was really fortunate as a grandchild that her grandmother watched her regularly so that her mom could go to grad school.
If you do refuse to watch your grandchild without payment (or if you do it but are passive aggressive about it), please prepare yourself for a bad outcome. You‚Äôre in charge of your own life, and you can make whatever choices you want. But if there‚Äôs the smallest hint of love and kindness in your soul, at least cancel on her a couple of weeks in advance so she can make other arrangements.

Your child is asking for help. She may be hiding what she‚Äôs going through in order to please or not upset others, including you. Your first step is to believe her. Your second is to empathize. Your third is to get her the help she needs. The first two don‚Äôt accomplish the third; only getting her the help will accomplish that. You might think telling her that she can tell you anything solves it, but if there‚Äôs stuff she‚Äôs not comfortable talking to you about, it‚Äôs not necessarily something she‚Äôs doing wrong. She might feel more comfortable talking about it with someone who isn‚Äôt connected with any other stuff going on in her life. You, as her parent, are connected to nearly every aspect, and she‚Äôs dependent upon you for food and shelter. That‚Äôs A LOT of involvement. And if you search ‚Äúpsych‚Ä¶

You‚Äôve thrown it away, so a cop, a neighbor, or anyone else can go through it. Cops don‚Äôt need warrants for trash pulls, for instance. But you might want to update your security system immediately. Your neighbor is certainly not doing a ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù thing, and feels entitled to information about you. You are not overreacting by feeling creepy about this. A cross-cutting paper shredder should be affordable online, and you can use that to securely destroy your sensitive information.
To reiterate: you do not own your trash after it leaves your house. It is legally not yours after that.

If your child took a toy home from another child‚Äôs house and the other parent asked for it back because their child was upset, but your child refused to part with it, should you buy a replacement toy or not?
You don‚Äôt have to be a jerk to teach the lessons that 1) there‚Äôs not a reward to be expected from stealing and 2) when we steal from someone, it has an impact. The toy is the other child‚Äôs; the other child should get it back. Sure, your kid handing it back with apology is preferable, but no matter what, that‚Äôs that child‚Äôs toy. That‚Äôs the first priority. Then, you talk to your kid: ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt okay. You made ____ very upset.

Are fat people who claim that fat shaming will just make them eat more the same as alcoholics who claim that they'll just drink more if people hold an intervention for them?
Lol no. Shaming is ineffective, period, and everyone has an opinion. Imagine this: you‚Äôre losing weight, but you‚Äôre still fat, and people tell you so whenever you‚Äôre sharing space with them (strangers, family, everyone). Wouldn‚Äôt it feel like you couldn‚Äôt win, so what‚Äôs the point?
It‚Äôs often cast as ‚Äúconcern for health,‚Äù too. And yeah, some fat people are unhealthy, just like some skinny people are unhealthy. The difference is that skinny people don‚Äôt get comments from everyone and their mom.
Worst case scenario, if you keep it to yourself, you‚Äôre not causing additional harm.

Just because a cop can‚Äôt arrest you for being insulting doesn‚Äôt mean a cop can‚Äôt arrest you‚Äîor detain you to investigate. It‚Äôs not illegal, but it‚Äôs also not smart.

For me, my periods with the biggest weight loss have been a result of my improving health, and not the other way around. Weight loss is not itself a panacea, and obesity is not CHD, Diabetes, or anything else, in itself; sometimes, it‚Äôs a symptom of something bigger going on.
Sometimes, my weight has been an obstacle to physicians treating my symptoms (like the time I literally had a fever with chills and DayQuil vomit on my shirt, and was whisper-arguing‚Äîsore throat‚Äîwith my doctor about his recommendation that I take a walk that day! Like‚Ä¶ dude, really? I‚Äôm trembling in a heated blanket, and you have yet to swab my nose. Aren‚Äôt there more immediate concerns?); sometimes, I‚Äôve lucked out, and the doctors have treated my symptoms, which resulted in better sleep and an increased ability to move my body, which naturally led to food decisions based less on stress and low energy.
There‚Äôs no doubt that cooking a piece of salmon and putting it on a bed of salmon and arugula with some lime juice and olive oil is more enjoyable than eating a bag of chips; however, on my worst days, sometimes I have to pat myself on the back for eating, at all. If you assess the symptoms instead of the appearance, you can give people more good days, and save more lives. Many people are actually doing their best; it just looks different from yours. If it didn‚Äôt, you might be crowded out of a job!
Doctors have missed cancer, gall stones, appendicitis, thyroid issues, fibro, etc. from assuming that whatever someone was reporting was related to their weight. To me, *that is malfeasance and malpractice*. What makes weight more important to treat than any of those issues, and how does treating weight before anything else improve patient outcomes in individuals experiencing them? If literally everyone else is telling them to lose weight, *why should they miss work and pay you to tell them the same thing*?

First of all I feel incredibly sorry for your loss, Nilbah and my thoughts are with you as I read this. Secondly, take your own advice here! Out of all of the pushy people on here arguing about God and giving you their ‚Äòadvice', this is the best thing I've read, coming from your very own self. I don't think throwing yourself into work or school fresh out of a tragedy like this is in anyone's best interest, especially your own. While it‚Äôs easy for everyone to tell you what you should do next, none of these people can even imagine the pain you must be going through and the time-consuming thoughts of grief that must have taken over your life so suddenly. I can imagine it must be hard to gather any thoughts at all, let alone to throw yourself into academics that would take a lot of focus and hard work to succeed at. And failing at that would only make things worse. You're 21, you have plenty of time to get back on your feet and get an education when your mind isn't a mish-mash of grief.
If it's financially feasible for you, I think taking yourself out of your lonely apartment and going on a trip somewhere you've always wanted to go, taking your mind off of the monotonous day-to day life is a really great idea. Go on an adventure, meet some new people from other walks of life, lay low, relax, take it all in! Who knows, maybe you will find somewhere you love so much you will want to stay there! When the time comes you can circle back to going to college and living a thriving, successful life. You are so young, don't put too much pressure on yourself right now.

My daughter's therapist diagnosed her with BPD. I told her she wasn't allowed to take medication and that she needs to learn to just deal with it, and now she wants to move out. What should I do?
You probably should just tell her SHES NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT EITHER! And then just wait until she commits suicide or turns to drugs. Then She'll be gone for good. You're a worthless parent.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
You don't believe her?! Are you serious?! Why would she make that up? Do you know how many people I knew in high school that committed suicide (as young as 12!) because ‚Äòthere weren't any symptoms' and their parents/friends had no idea how sad they were? WAKE UP! And be happy your daughter is reaching out to you instead of holding in her anguish. Most people have some sort of depression/anxiety, especially women. And being a teenager is hard. There is a lot of pressure to be ‚Äòperfect‚Äô. By everyone. Peers, teachers, parents, grands, siblings, roll models, etc. Get your daughter the help she asks for before she ends up like so many people I've known.

You can't be mad at the daughter. Addiction is not a choice. It is a mental disorder. She should be proud her daughter is getting the help she needs. Most addicts don't, or won't! It's 28 days of this man's life. Big deal. When you get married, you marry a FAMILY, not just a wife.

Wow, how can you even ponder on this? My Mom's 3rd husband has RAISED my child since he was 2. He's 13 now. His Dad and I fell into the thros of addiction just like your daughter. I've been clean now for 9 years but because we don't want to disrupt his comfortable life at ‚ÄòHOME (yes, my parents house is his HOME) my ‚Äòstep' Dad STILL raises him, even though both his Dad and I have been clean for years. Now that is a GOOD husband, father, grandfather! Yours is questionable if he's not willing to take in a helpless 5 year old for even 28 days.

My 11 year old son is getting interested in playing video games but I don‚Äôt want to introduce him to it yet. What is a safe age to let him start playing?
My son is 13 and been gaming since he was probably 5. He's highly addicted to it and if I'm being honest, I don't have a problem with it. I can think of worse things he could be doing. He's an only child and we kind of live in the boonies, so it is not only his form of entertainment, but also his social outlet. He has friends, gets good grades (in honors courses) and is a VERY good kid. Gaming or drugs? I choose gaming every time!

a lot of mental illnesses arent visible she doesn‚Äôt have to be acting crazy in order for something to be wrong, reaching out to someone for help is very difficult‚Ä¶ feel honored she trust you enough to tell you about it. sometimes, you just have to say yes. Better to be safe than sorry, if she‚Äôs asking for help, please just say yes. don‚Äôt let her grow up and live thinking her feeling or situation will be ignored if she ever needs to ask for help, and that applies to any situation not just mental health

street gangs although dangerous don‚Äôt look to control other areas, only keeping people out of their area and business. mafias and cartels are practically the same they work together they just define your level in the group like the people who can actually give orders being a higher level, the sicarios who do the actual selling and killing, and the mexican government (believe it or not) would be the lowest as they slowly make their way into the organization but never make it to the top and some officers who don‚Äôt contribute to it but dont get in the way either as their families will most likely be hurt if someone decides to get in the way. usually they don‚Äôt purposely hurt regular civilians who have nothing to do but unfortunately some get killed, kidnapped or tortured due to false info if‚Ä¶

You take her to see a therapist. Even if you haven't noticed any outward signs or symptoms, that doesn't mean she doesn't have any.
That's it. That's the whole answer.

Did Magnus Bane have feelings for Will Herondale?
It was never exactly made clear one way or the other; Magnus is a somewhat mysterious sort of character in the first place, and I think living several centuries probably taught him not to be terribly forthcoming with every feeling he had as well. I believe he may have, and I'm sure there are fanfictions which entertain the notion to its fullest extent if you feel inclined to seek them out (though Clare is one of my most favourite authors, so I was never able to appreciate fanfictions of her works as they never could have measured up to her writing style; I never attempted to write any myself for the same reason). But if he did, he would have known that Will was both heterosexual and in love with Tessa, so he would have seen no good reason to make his feelings known regardless. Essentially,‚Ä¶

Wouldn't ""The Mortal Instruments"" by Cassandra Clare and ""Percy Jackson"" by Rick Riordan be of the Urban Fantasy genre?
I don't know about Rick Riordan, as I've never read anything of his and am unfamiliar with him, but I do know the Mortal Instruments series was described as urban fantasy by Clare. I don't recall where I read that, though it was likely either on her old LiveJournal or on the official website. Although, possibly it was during the one very brief exchange of emails I had with Clare shortly after City of Bones was released, when I suddenly couldn't find her fanfictions (which were my favourites, and at the time I would re-read them about once a year; I still have them saved to my phone, even now) online anymore, and she very kindly pointed me toward a source where I could still download their PDFs, and explained that her publisher had advised her to take them offline since some of her original‚Ä¶

I mean. Yeah, if your argument for gun ownership is just a general blanket statement about protecting innocent lives, it will fall flat quickly when the stats are taken into account. But‚Ä¶ that's not why we have the right to bear arms, not really.
Edit: I am not a gun owner, and I have a serious aversion to people owning guns without learning how to handle and store them appropriately. I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong, but the reason we were given that right was so that we had the ability to rise up against a tyrannical government. And, as much as I'm not a fan of the weird firearm obsession shared by much of the country, we may well see the day when we will need that right, for that reason.

The short answer is no. No, you shouldn't. Nobody should. That's how it will continue, by being allowed to do so by the general population.

How much does getting a helix piercing hurt?
Not too badly. I made the mistake of having three done in the same ear at the same time. The first two weren't bad, but the third one did hurt quite a bit, as you might imagine. I'm sure it was because, being the third in a row, it was done right beside two other brand-new piercings.

First of all it‚Äôs good news that she cares about herself to share her feelings and thoughts on her mental health with you. Now with regards to your question, as a pharmacist and healthcare professional, I suggest you to tell her to make an appointment with a psychologist (not psychiatrist) at first.

They can help people to overcome or manage their problems using a variety of treatments or psychotherapies. I should mention that it‚Äôs not necessary to have an illness to go to a psychologist and even people with no problem can benefit from getting an overall understanding of their mental health.

Understanding Narcissistic Abuse: What It Is and How To Recover?
Narcissistic abuse is a form of emotional and psychological abuse that is perpetrated by someone with narcissistic personality disorder or traits. It can take many forms, including gaslighting, manipulation, emotional neglect, belittling, and exploitation.
The following are some common signs of narcissistic abuse:
A constant need for attention and admiration
Belittling, demeaning, or insulting language or behavior
An inability to acknowledge or apologize for mistakes
A lack of empathy for others
Manipulation and gaslighting
Control and domination over their partner
Emotional neglect or abandonment
Blaming their partner for everything that goes wrong in the relationship
Isolation from family and friends
Threats or violence.
Recovering from narcissistic abuse can be a long and difficult process, but it is possible. The following are some strategies that may help:
Seek Therapy: Therapy can provide a safe space to process your experiences and emotions, and can help you develop coping mechanisms for dealing with triggers and negative thoughts.
Build a Support System: Surround yourself with friends and family who are supportive and understanding, and who can provide emotional support when you need it.
Practice Self-Care: Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. This can include exercise, healthy eating, getting enough sleep, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.
Set Boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with the person who has abused you, and stick to them. This can include limiting or cutting off contact, and refusing to engage in behaviors that are harmful to you.
Challenge Negative Self-Talk: Work to identify and challenge negative beliefs and thoughts about yourself that were reinforced by the abuse.
Take Legal Action If Necessary: If you have experienced physical or sexual abuse, or if your partner has engaged in illegal activities, consider taking legal action.
Recovering from narcissistic abuse can be a difficult and overwhelming process. It is important to seek professional help to heal from the trauma of being in an abusive relationship. Therapy for narcissistic traumaTherapy for narcissistic trauma, emotional abuse victims, and survivors of domestic violence are all available options for those seeking help. Professional counselors and therapists can provide support, guidance, and tools to help individuals manage their emotions, cope with the effects of the abuse, and develop healthy coping strategies. With the right kind of therapy, survivors can begin to heal from their traumatic experiences and move forward with their lives.
Remember, recovery is a process, and it can take time. Be patient with yourself and seek support when you need it.

Narcissistic abuse is a form of emotional and psychological abuse that is perpetrated by someone with narcissistic personality disorder or traits. It can take many forms, including gaslighting, manipulation, emotional neglect, belittling, and exploitation.
The following are some common signs of narcissistic abuse:
A constant need for attention and admiration
Belittling, demeaning, or insulting language or behavior
An inability to acknowledge or apologize for mistakes
A lack of empathy for others
Manipulation and gaslighting
Control and domination over their partner
Emotional neglect or abandonment
Blaming their partner for everything that goes wrong in the relationship
Isolation from family and friends
Threats or violence.
Recovering from narcissistic abuse can be a long and difficult process, but it is possible. The following are some strategies that may help:
Seek Therapy: Therapy can provide a safe space to process your experiences and emotions, and can help you develop coping mechanisms for dealing with triggers and negative thoughts.
Build a Support System: Surround yourself with friends and family who are supportive and understanding, and who can provide emotional support when you need it.
Practice Self-Care: Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. This can include exercise, healthy eating, getting enough sleep, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.
Set Boundaries: Establish clear boundaries with the person who has abused you, and stick to them. This can include limiting or cutting off contact, and refusing to engage in behaviors that are harmful to you.
Challenge Negative Self-Talk: Work to identify and challenge negative beliefs and thoughts about yourself that were reinforced by the abuse.
Take Legal Action If Necessary: If you have experienced physical or sexual abuse, or if your partner has engaged in illegal activities, consider taking legal action.
Recovering from narcissistic abuse can be a difficult and overwhelming process. It is important to seek professional help to heal from the trauma of being in an abusive relationship. Therapy for narcissistic trauma, emotional abuse victims, and survivors of domestic violence are all available options for those seeking help. Professional counselors and therapists can provide support, guidance, and tools to help individuals manage their emotions, cope with the effects of the abuse, and develop healthy coping strategies. With the right kind of therapy, survivors can begin to heal from their traumatic experiences and move forward with their lives.
Remember, recovery is a process, and it can take time. Be patient with yourself and seek support when you need it.

Admitting your mistakes is never easy. It needs considerable power and encouragement. Only influential people can accept if they did anything wrong. When people avoid to make lame excuses and own their mistakes, their strong and courageous personalities become visible in front of others.
People start believing them because of their honesty, and they become save from losing their reputation.
It is impossible to move on and make progress if you have any past guilt in you because
of any mistake you have done. If you have not admitted it, it will accompany you wherever you go. You will be caught up in the past mistakes which prevent you from moving on.
The solution to this is that you admit your mistake as soon as possible. It will improve your focus in your present instead of your past, and you will feel free from stressful feelings.

My son got an A in his AP Spanish 4 class. Yet, when I ask him to speak Spanish for me, he can‚Äôt say anything. Should I be mad at the teacher or my son? I am preparing an email now for the teacher and I‚Äôm ready to send it, if I feel it‚Äôs necessary.
My main language is Spanish, but I can never say I truly know Spanish. If your son is an English speaker, learning Spanish will obviously be hard for him also he could be a visual learner not a speech learner. Meaning, maybe he can read and understand Spanish but speaking it is non existent. That is normal, specially if he doesn't have friends that speak Spanish were he can practice.

Why are some people afraid of the fact that gender is socially constructed? What is actually threatened?
‚Äò‚Äôgender is socially constructed‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äî this is really an oversimplified statement. What is meant by this is - our gender expression is a social construct (like calling something masculine or feminine) but our gender identity is not a social construct (feeling masculine or feminine).

Is 25 too old to play video games?
Video games have no age, if you feel like you are not doing the things you should be doing because you are playing video games all the time then create a discipline, do what you have to do first and THEN play video games. Video games are a way to free yourself from life hardships so if it helps you, by all means don't stop, just take care of yourself and always look out for what's best for you.

My 14 year old daughter failed out of her math class. How do I tell her there's no hope for her?
What? Ask yourself why is she failing, does she has a good teacher? Is she okay mentally? Like is she feeling depressed or anxiety. Communicate with your child. And SPECIALLY don't tell her that there is no hope for her or she will believe that all her life. And it would have been your fault, as a parent you can only support your kid. No child is stupid they just need the right support. Are you doing enough?

My 13 year old daughter was video chatting a 21 year old man at 1AM. I found her in a dark room doing this. What do I do?
Sadly around that age I met a man that wasn't 21 but much older, he made me do things that as an innocent kid I didn't understand but being much older I realized that it was sexual assault and that he was a pedophile. My recommendation is help your daughter so that in the future if she goes to therapy is not because of that. She probably won't understand now but in the future or when she has kids of her own, she will understand. And if you can figure out who that dude is‚Ä¶report him, that's a pedophile. No 21 years old should be talking with a 13 year old girl cuz trust me, they ain't talking about school or the multiplication tables.

Your daughter telling you all of a sudden doesn't mean that she is faking it, it just means that it got bad enough were she realized she needed help and decided to trust you with the information. Do yourself a favor as I am sure you are a loving parent, take your daughter to therapy so that hopefully you never have to come here to give an update that she is gone. This comes from experience in this department, I spend years hiding my emotions, I spend years contemplating if I should end it or not and the only thing that always stopped me is the thought of the stage that I would leave my parents if I actually do it, I finally told my parents and this started years of therapy and I am currently on antidepressants being diagnosed by a therapist with an anxiety disorder, and depression.

About 8 days ago, I got a tattoo and it looked great. As days passed, I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs been scabbing and flaking to the point where the tattoo is coming off. Is this normal? Is my tattoo supposed to look like this?
You don't have to worry at all, it's normal. Just don't scratch it or you are going to mess the tattoo up or scar yourself, and when it gets unbearable and it will, use this cream (I got it at Walgreens) hidrocortisone 1%, I got one with Aloe and it's really good. And if you don't have after care for the tat use coconut oil, that will also help with the itch but not for a long time, it will help heal faster and it is great for the skin. What's important is that you keep the tat moisturized until it heals. And when it's all done, if you wanna see it look shiny and with bright colors, use coconut oil. Again, don't scratch it, if you can't help it, give little pats at the zone. Oh and wash your tattoo at least 3 times a day, remember it's an open wound and bacterias happen so use a sope that‚Ä¶

My 18-year-old son continues to play video games even after I smashed his laptop and deleted his Steam account. How can I permanently put an end to his gaming?
Let your son be happy. Or idk ask him why he plays so much, communicate with him instead of breaking his things. Maybe playing video games makes him happy or distracts him from his own personal problems. Breaking and deleting his acc (which both are fcked up) will only cause your relationship with him to break and soon you will be asking yourself why your son doesn't visit or talks to you. This is coming from a fellow gamer who it's all ready on its way to break all communication with my parents bc of the same sht. Just let him be happy

Is vaping bad for your health?
Vaping has been a controversial topic for the past few years, with people on both sides of the argument stating their views on the potential risks and benefits. On one hand, vaping is often promoted as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes, which are known to cause numerous health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. On the other hand, there have been numerous reports of people experiencing serious health problems as a result of vaping, leading many experts to question whether or not it is truly safe. So, what is the truth about the potential risks and benefits of vaping? Is it really a safer alternative to smoking, or are there serious health concerns that need to be taken into consideration?

It is important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, as your daughter may be feeling vulnerable and distressed about her perceived mental health issues. It is also important to recognize that mental health issues can manifest in different ways and may not always be immediately visible to others. First, it is important to listen to your daughter and validate her feelings. Ask her about her concerns and try to understand what she is going through. Encourage her to talk about her experiences and feelings, and let her know that you are there to support her. It may be helpful to seek out more information about mental health and the different types of disorders that exist. This can help you better understand your daughter's concerns and how they may be impacting her. It can a‚Ä¶

How do gender, age and activity levels affect an individual's ideal percentage of body fat?
Body fat percentage is the amount of fat in the body as a percentage of total body weight. It is different from body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of body weight relative to height. There are various methods for measuring body fat percentage, including skinfold thickness measurements, bioelectrical impedance, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and hydrostatic weighing. These methods can be divided into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct methods measure body fat directly, while indirect methods estimate body fat based on other measurements such as weight, height, and circumference. There is no one ""ideal"" percentage of body fat for all individuals. The amount of body fat that is healthy for an individual depends on several factors, including age, gender, and activity leve‚Ä¶

How do the nutrients in dairy products contribute to bone health?
Dairy products are a rich source of several nutrients that contribute to bone health. These include calcium, vitamin D, and protein. Calcium is a mineral that is essential for building and maintaining strong bones. It helps to form the matrix of bones, which gives them their strength and structure. Dairy products are some of the best sources of calcium, with a single serving providing up to 300 mg of calcium. This is especially important for young people during their growth and development, as their bones are still growing and need a constant supply of calcium to stay strong and healthy. Vitamin D is another important nutrient for bone health. It helps the body absorb and use calcium effectively, and a deficiency in vitamin D can lead to weak bones.

Is there any relation between age and body fat levels?
Yes, body fat levels generally increase there is a relationship between age and body fat levels, although the specific relationship may vary from person to person. As we age, our metabolism naturally slows down, and we tend to lose muscle mass. This can lead to an increase in body fat levels, as the body is less able to efficiently burn calories and fat.¬∂

In addition to the natural slowing of metabolism, there are also hormonal changes that occur during the aging process that can contribute to an increase in body fat levels. For example, levels of the hormone testosterone, which helps to regulate muscle mass and metabolism, tend to decrease with age in men. This can lead to a decrease in muscle mass and an increase in body fat. Similarly, levels of estrogen, which helps to regulate body fat distribution, tend to decrease with age in women. This can lead to an increase in body fat, particularly in the abdominal area.¬∂

However, it is important to note that the relationship between age and body fat levels is not necessarily linear. While body fat levels may increase with age for some individuals, others may not experience this same increase. Factors such as diet, physical activity levels, and genetics can also play a role in body fat levels as we age.¬∂

For example, individuals who maintain a healthy diet and engage in regular physical activity may be able to maintain a healthy body fat level despite the natural slowing of metabolism that occurs with age. As people get older, their metabolism tends to slow down, and On the other hand, individuals who have an unhealthy diet and are inactive may be more likely to experience an increase in body fat levels as they may not be as active as they were in their younger years. This can lead to an accumulation of fat in the body.¬∂

However, genetics, diet, and exercise habits age.¬∂

Additionally, genetics can also play a role in body fat levels, so it levels. Some individuals may be genetically predisposed to carrying more body fat, while others may have a genetic tendency towards a lower body fat level. This can affect the relationship between age and body fat levels, as some individuals may be more resistant to an increase in body fat levels as they age due to their genetics.¬∂

Overall, there is a relationship between age and body fat levels, but this relationship is not a given that everyone will experience an increase in body fat as they necessarily linear and can be influenced by factors such as diet, physical activity levels, and genetics. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity, can help to mitigate any potential increase in body fat levels as we age.

This can lead to a decrease in muscle mass and an increase in body fat. Similarly, levels of estrogen, which helps to regulate body fat distribution, tend to decrease with‚Ä¶

I don't think that you should restrict her once a week it's ridiculous,it's okay to restrict it like how many hours a day,when it's dinner,family bond that's still normal, what if she have uhh projects,homework that needed to send by online,phone?that's all I might sound stupid but it's okay I guess

Tbh just let her see a professional at least a week first just don't say anything about that you don't see any symptoms ppl are different doesn't mean each symptom are the same sometimes it doesn't some people might went through differently and their responses are also different let her go to a therapist at least a week then see the progress don't ask the progress on her ask the therapist

I yelled at my daughter while she was having a panic attack because she didn't want to go to the pool with me. Now she won't talk to me. Am I in the wrong and how can I fix this?
Yes you're wrong,she clearly doesn't want to go to blablabka I forgot already and you insist her then she had panic attack I never knew what panic attack could look like I'll look after this still insisting when she chosen no it's pretty bad then my opinion how to fix this is first try not to be egoistical on simple shit that u want second try to speak and promise to her that you would never do something like that never again make sure you gain her trust maybe ask if she wants to go or do something or not (if something not that important) asking over opinion is also important in relationship either romantical or not it's just gonna be bad if none of you both understand each other's opinion

Why am I average at everything and not excellent at one thing?
I know this is a very old question but I feel this way now. I am a student, and as a kid I was extremely curious about things, I‚Äôd somehow end up spending hours knowing about whatever was going on around me, like literally dig 10 different websites on the 2g internet connection. When I grew up I realised because of this I knew a lot more than other kids, but that didn't really make me egoistic, rather it made me feel like I was maybe focusing on pretty random things way too much? Even when I tend to study something, I deep dive unknowingly, but not enough to actually make it something useful. Because of this I have been above average in a lot of things but never been a master of one thing. I really wish I could trade my skills with someone who can dedicate all their time and life into some‚Ä¶

If you leave depression untreated, will it get worse?
Yes, it does get worse. The problem is that people don‚Äôt understand that the treatment is not short, but is actually quite lengthy. When I was diagnosed with depression, I didn‚Äôt want to be a financial burden on my family by constantly going to therapy and getting anti-depressants, I felt guilty, so I stopped. My therapist also just played along with my act since she felt that the guilt was eating me up too much. Fast-forward 4 years, I am still unable to function like I used to. I get a lot of remarks from people around me saying how I look numb/sleepy or expressionless. Which is in fact complete opposite of what I used to be. In fact, even now I don‚Äôt have as much energy as I used to before, every chore takes a toll on me. So, TLDR: Yes it affects you pretty badly, get the treatment requi‚Ä¶

Don't question your daughter, she is not an idiot to claim she has mental health issues. Regarding the symptoms, you have no idea how well kids hide things, just because she doesn't look physically sick or emotionally closed off, it doesn't mean that she isn't going through anything. Go to a therapist once and at the least make sure she is good, I'll say from my father's perspective, he did the exact same drama of saying I wasn't sick enough to go see a therapist, finally when time came, things became so bad we had to go, the relationship between me and my father has completely changed. If you don't want to experience that then take your daughter to the therapist, sort it out and be empathetic towards her.

INFP here, totally felt like school was just not meant for me. It was actually quite painful to push through. I just don't like studying or doing something that I don't feel anything towards which I feel like is a disadvantage since being adaptable is much better. However my teachers didn't see me as dumb or so, luckily they thought that I was good at school and that I actually lacked interest in it

Glad someone pointed this out, I too feel that girls tend to bring eachother down a lot, guys get over it in a minute. After having some interaction with guys and girls who hang around with guys, you can really see how different it feels.

What are some views about men's mental health?
This is the thing that nobody wanna talk about ‚Äúmen's mental health‚Äù and the reality is nobody cares
men can only be loved in conditions that they will provide something
the man is dealing with the financial situation of his house
dealing with the expectations of his parents
dealing with society‚Äôs inequality
sacrificing his own dreams
I think men are all about
Sacrificing
Compromising
Adjusting
Man is very selfless

What is the meaning of getting attached with someone when at the end they end up leaving you for someone else?
If you are talking or spending time with him or her daily then you ended up being attached to your partner and if you are available for your partner every time so the chances are high that your partner took you for granted and they do not actually love you they just timepass with you in the name of love and after sometimes they get bored of you and ended up leaving you for someone else easily

How can you differentiate if someone is in love with you or not?
let's assume she is a girl
then if she is giving you hints as she prioritizes you over her any important work and if she asks how was your day and discusses little things with you what she has done in a day and makes excuses to spend more and more time with you then probably she is in love with you
the smartest way to know if she is in love with you or not
propose her and you get your answer

Where can I get the best affordable online counseling?
Just like any other normal human, there was a time when I was quite disturbed and depressed. And I was desperately looking for some external help in the form of online counselling. So my constant search made me come across BetterLYF online counselling sessions. I attended that session which turned out to be too good. From then onwards there was no looking back and fortunately, I was able to step out of that phase of my life. Online counselling allows you to come up with your issues and concerns and get support and guidance on the same. It provides a confidential space to you where you can comfortably talk about the problems you‚Äôre going through. With the help of counseling you can address a wide range of issues, including stress, anxiety, depression, relationship problems, family issues, tr‚Ä¶

Building a Loving Marriage: Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts for a Lasting Relationship
In any relationship, mutual love and respect are essential. While every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach, here are some general guidelines:
What to Do:
1. Communicate Openly: Share your thoughts, feelings, and concerns with your husband. Honest communication builds trust and emotional connection.
2. Show Appreciation: Acknowledge and appreciate the things your husband does for you and the family. Gratitude can strengthen your bond.
3. Support His Goals and Dreams: Encourage him in his ambitions and be his biggest cheerleader. Showing that you believe in him fosters love and respect.
4. Take Care of Yourself: Physically, emotionally, and mentally taking care of yourself makes you feel good and helps maintain attraction and interest.
5. Be Affectionate: Physical touch, compliments, and small acts of kindness can reinforce your love for each other.
6. Share Responsibilities: Work together as a team in managing household tasks, finances, and other responsibilities. This promotes partnership and equality.
7. Maintain Your Individuality: While being a couple is important, maintaining your own interests and friendships adds balance to the relationship.
8. Resolve Conflicts Respectfully: Disagreements are natural, but how you handle them matters. Address issues calmly and seek solutions together.
9. Be a Good Listener: Sometimes, your husband may just need someone to listen. Be there for him without immediately offering solutions.
What Not to Do:
1. Don‚Äôt Nag or Criticize Constantly: Frequent criticism can create resentment. Choose your battles wisely and focus on constructive feedback.
2. Don‚Äôt Compare Him to Others: Comparisons, especially unfavorable ones, can hurt his self-esteem and damage your relationship.
3. Don‚Äôt Be Overly Dependent: While it‚Äôs okay to lean on each other, being overly dependent can strain the relationship. Strive for a healthy balance.
4. Avoid Emotional Manipulation: Using guilt, silent treatment, or other forms of manipulation can erode trust and love.
5. Don‚Äôt Neglect His Needs: Just as you have needs, so does your husband. Ensure that his emotional, physical, and psychological needs are met.
6. Don‚Äôt Hold Grudges: Holding onto past issues can prevent your relationship from growing. Practice forgiveness and move forward together.
7. Avoid Public Criticism: If there‚Äôs an issue, address it privately rather than criticizing him in front of others.
8. Don‚Äôt Be Dismissive of His Feelings: Even if you disagree, acknowledging his feelings shows that you respect and care for him.
9. Don‚Äôt Stop Putting in Effort: Relationships require continuous effort from both sides. Keep the spark alive by continuing to invest in your relationship.
Building a loving and strong relationship takes effort from both partners.

Here is what you need to know before stepping into one of the surest way to succeed online in the aspects of e-commerce.
I have compiled all the necessary information with some examples of companies that are into this. Read more to find out‚Ä¶.
The Role of Social Media in E-Commerce
The Role of Social Media in E-Commerce: Leveraging Platforms for Growth In the dynamic landscape of modern commerce, the fusion of social media and e-commerce has become a driving force, reshaping the way businesses connect with consumers and fueling unparalleled growth. This intricate dance between platforms and online retailers goes beyond mere marketing‚Äîit's about creating immersive experiences, fostering brand loyalty, and leveraging the power of advertisements. Let's delve into the multifaceted role of social media in e-commerce, with a particular focus on the significance of ads, exploring how even globally renowned companies continue to prioritize and innovate in this space. Evolution of Social Media in E-Commerce: The evolution of social media platforms from simple communication tools to complex ecosystems has been a game-changer for e-commerce. These platforms, once a means for connecting with friends, have morphed into powerful channels for businesses to showcase products, engage with audiences, and cultivate brand identity. As we navigate this digital landscape, it's crucial to understand the pivotal role social media plays in driving growth for e-commerce enterprises. Engagement Beyond Marketing: Social media's real power lies in its ability to facilitate engagement. The likes of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter offer direct access to consumers, allowing businesses to forge genuine connections. This engagement is not just transactional but serves to build lasting relationships. Consider Nike, a global giant that transcends traditional advertising. Nike utilizes Instagram to create narratives around empowerment, athleticism, and inclusivity. By emphasizing these values, Nike doesn't just sell products; it creates a community, fostering a sense of belonging among its diverse audience. Brand Awareness and Loyalty: The bedrock of successful e-commerce starts with brand awareness, and social media acts as a potent amplifier. Iconic brands like Glossier exemplify this phenomenon. Glossier's Instagram serves as a visual diary, showcasing user-generated content and emphasizing a natural, inclusive approach to beauty. By prioritizing customer experience and authenticity, Glossier has cultivated a loyal following that extends beyond traditional consumer-brand relationships. Ads as Catalysts for Growth: While organic reach is crucial, the strategic use of advertisements on social media platforms has become indispensable for e-commerce growth. It's not just about reaching a broader audience; it's about reaching the right audience. Take ASOS, a global fashion giant, for example. Through targeted ads on Facebook and Instagram, ASOS tailors its content to match individual preferences. This not only maximizes the impact of their advertising budget but also enhances the overall user experience by showcasing products tailored to each consumer's style. Examples of Ad Success Despite Popularity: Even as companies attain global recognition, many still pri

My tenant refused to allow me to do a surprise inspection of the rental unit, so I called the police and had him arrested. How can I make him pay for the disposal of his belongings before the new tenant moves in?
You cannot just randomly pop into your tenets, you know that right? You have to give at least 24 hour notice. So that alone the former tenet can go further about. Secondly, the police are not going to arrest someone because they wouldn't let you onto a property they are renting from you without proper valid notice. Thirdly, no proper eviction notice?
I really hope you thought this through because now I feel you've opened up unnecessary things for you now as the former tenent can sue you for many things here. I hope it was worth it.

I reported my therapist to my state mental health board for abandonment. In the complaint I also mentioned the fact that the office manager leaves reception unattended quite often. Will the office manager possibly get in trouble too?
Depends on what you mean abandonment. As in when people are seeing a therapist, they can feel abandoned at the slightest thing. But that does not necessarily mean that the person was actually abandoned.
As for receptionist not being at the desk, they could have a legit reason. Receptionists don't leave desks unless necessary and it doesn't be for long. Ie, toilet break, needed printing etc.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
I would start off by BELIEVING her.
Go to her GP who may be able to refer her to counselling.
Anyone suffering with MH and being told they are not believed, does more damage than anything.

Have you ever come across psychologically abusive people who seem to be extremely sophisticated in the way they do it, not cliche at all and maybe even well-read on the psychology topics? Describe them.
Yes but the ‚Äústories‚Äù lack substance. For example people say that narcissists don‚Äôt ever accept responsibility. This may be true but the more experienced manipulators know that they need to appear accepting of their own faults. They will say things like ‚ÄúI was to blame as well‚Äù. It when you dig deeper it is scripted or rehearsed.
the same with empathy. Narcissistic people can behave in a way that appears empathetic but it‚Äôs very textbook and often (in my experience anyway) it‚Äôs like watching Hollywood so is over the top.
the behaviours seem scripted and fake but it throws you off and can be quite hard to pick. We all read about the manipulators who behave in an outlandish manner. Many of them don‚Äôt because they learnt early in that society doesn‚Äôt appreciate that behaviour.

If you must be in this relationship then some advice Dr Ramani has offered is to only talk about mundane topics like the weather and don‚Äôt engage when they start playing games (it‚Äôs raining and they say it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt react). Be aware that they will not meet all of your needs so make sure to have a strong support network around you that will meet your emotional needs. Find a good therapist who will help you navigate the upheaval that usually comes with an abusive relationship. You will need a lot of support to help you deal with the lying, manipulation, cheating, gaslighting etc.
take care and ask if you really need to be there x

How do I stop being a weak person and implement strong boundaries after trauma and narcissistic abuse?
Firstly be kind to yourself. You probably have a trauma bond as a result of the abuse. Start journalling and researching emotional abuse and take it one day (one minute if you must) at a time. Time will gel you heal. It can be helpful to find a good therapist as well. Surround yourself with people who love you. All the best x

Do sociopaths/psychopaths feel anything towards people that they don't know well but are close enough to call friend(s)?
Sociopaths, psychopaths and other people with personality disorders have feelings. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by towards other people but if you mean can they feel sad when somebody else feels sad then yes they can have empathy for other people but not in the way most healthy-minded people do. if you mean can they be attracted to, desire a potential partner then absolutely.

When did you realize that your ex was a narcissist and on what basis?
There were warning signs that I sadly ignored or explained away but they stuck in my memory. He told me his ex said he was a narcissist but he‚Äôd painted her as one so I took it as her projecting. He was very humble (sort of) but I think it was to get the ‚Äò‚Äôno you‚Äôre amazing!‚Äô Adulation. It was the lack of empathy when I pulled him up for trying to make me jealous of his female friends (happened several times). It was shifted to me being jealous (I wasn‚Äôt really, just upset because I thought he was trying to make me jealous - very toxic) and took no responsibility. He apologised for his wrongdoings (when he said something nasty) but never specifically. Just said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äô. He had no care about my emotional health as a result of his behaviour.

I think I have a narcissistic personality disorder. what are some salient traits to look out for and what can I do to help myself?
There are lots of sources talking about characteristics but briefly having little or no empathy for other people, a grandiose sense of self (which is usually to mask inner feelings of inadequacy), not taking responsibility for your actions and it always being someone else‚Äôs fault for what happens to you.
speak to a trained therapist. It‚Äôs great you‚Äôre asking these questions but proper therapy would help more than the internet will.

Why do I lack sympathy and empathy for people, but pretend that I care? But I only ""care"" so I don't look like a heartless person. Like, I don't care how they feel, but I care how I look.
How do you feel about yourself when something isn‚Äôt going right in your life? Do you feel compassion for your struggle or do you feel impatient and resistant? Having empathy for yourself is important as you can‚Äôt have for others what you don‚Äôt have for yourself.

What are people who lack empathy? I have friends telling me their troubles, but I just don't care and can't connect with what they're feeling. I find it annoying. Am I a psycho or something?
Apparently psychopathy is calculated, narcissism is a lack of self identify. Both seem to stem from early childhood trauma but why people end up psychotic or a narcissist compared to having somethig like BPD is still being studied and not fully understood. Genetics may be involved.
my question based on your question is do you have empathy or compassion for yourself? What does your inner voice say when you‚Äôre having a hard time with something? Are you kind and tell yourself you will work through it or do you put yourself down for having the problem. If you can‚Äôt have empathy for yourself then you can‚Äôt have it for others. Same as love.

Do narcissists lack empathy?
Usually a narcissists personality disorder shows up because of trauma (abuse, neglect, abandonment,rejection of their identity) in childhood. Dr Vaknin talks about the child not being allowed to separate from their mother which inhibits them forming their identity.

Do narcissists tend to be cold while growing up at a young age or does the lack of empathy for people appear later in life?
From what I‚Äôve learnt (and just adding that my research is self-led not uni degree) npd develops as a result of neglect, abandonment and rejection of self in childhood. The child‚Äôs emotional needs are not met and they develop a false identity or sense of self as a protection from their pain. It seems to develop over time and shows as a lack of empathy for others and controlling behaviour. Behaviours are fueled by the false self that believes themself to be better than everybody else because it‚Äôs hiding the internal lack of self-love and awareness and is there to protect the persons ego. It is very sad and a difficult thing for a person with narcissistic traits to treat because their ego relies on their false identity to feel worthy (most don‚Äôt feel worthy anyway and it comes out as abuse to‚Ä¶

Why do I cry over little things?
One of the main reasons you cry over small things is that you don't realize their insignificance. You consider them major issues and overthink, leading to tears. When you are facing a situation that makes you want to cry, pause and ask yourself if it's truly worth your tears. Then, you will start avoiding crying because of every small thing happening around you. Your mind will automatically realize those things as tiny little insects. Thus, instead of crying, you will laugh.

Is it possible to be addicted to a person?
It is possible to become addicted to a person. You may feel drawn to someone who makes you feel comfortable, and without them, you may experience a sense of emptiness. As a result, you may feel the need for that person more frequently when you feel ignored or distant. Sometimes, the great attention from someone may serve as a purpose for another person to be addicted.

Which is easier, to love or to be loved?
Both loving someone and being loved can be challenging, but in my opinion, it is easier to be loved than to love someone. When someone loves you, you don't have to suffer, and you feel more confident because you know that person is paying attention to you. However, if someone loves you and you don't share the same feelings, you may feel anxious and uncertain about that person's intentions. Thus, being loved is relatively easier but, at the same time, has its difficulties.

In what way can the ""devil"" have the mind of a narcissist?
Individuals with narcissistic traits have a unique ability to manipulate and control others for their own gain. In some stories, the devil is portrayed as a crafty and deceitful character who uses manipulation to achieve his goals. The tactics used by the devil in these stories are similar to the methods employed by narcissists to exploit and deceive those around them.

How is it that most of us struggle to reach our potential, goals and innermost desires even when we kind of 'know' what needs to be done?
Often, we are aware of what we need to do to attain our objectives and aspirations, but we lack the knowledge of the specific tactics and techniques that can help us achieve them. The biggest challenge lies in our inability to comprehend how we should tackle the difficulties that come our way in order to accomplish our desires. As a result, if we understand how to overcome these obstacles, we can achieve any goal that we set for ourselves.

Who taught you how to be cool?
All of us are cool individually without anyone else's telling. You can be cool due to your values and morals. Try your best; you will not even think about ""who will tell me to be cool."" Sometimes, we see someone who can be a role model for us, and we believe that they are a very cool person, and we want them to tell us about their secret of success. This is wrong because we are just copying someone who may not even be cool. Always try to be a role model for yourself, and you will notice that you are definitely a cool person.

Why, during sleep paralysis, do I hear a voice say ""no one can hear you""? Has that happened to anyone else?
Usually, it is a self-hypnosis during nightmares. After a tired and stressful day, a person lies to sleep and sees a nightmare in which a bad person with a scary voice tells things that do not favor the person. All these are related to a person's bad mood before falling asleep and due to self-hypnosis. Usually, the monster with a scary voice is the one who was the cause of the person's mood fall.

My daughter (18) all of a sudden thinks she has mental health issues and wants to see a therapist. I don't believe her because she's never shown any symptoms. What should I do?
Although your daughter didn't show any signs of mental issues, that doesn't mean that she has not had any mental problems. Your daughter has issues and is asking you to see a therapist. Your daughter thinks only a therapist can help her deal with her mental issues. She can't share any of her problems with her friends or mother; thus, she didn't show any signs and wanted to see a therapist. She would have thought that you would not understand her.

What are the best ways to handle stress and stressful situations?
Dealing with stress and managing stressful situations can be challenging, but it is possible. It's important to remember that no one else can manage your stress for you - it's up to you to take control. One helpful strategy is to identify the things that trigger your stress, like certain situations or memories, and try to manage or avoid them. Engaging in activities or hobbies that make you happy can also help to eliminate stress. Another great tip is to organize your day with a structured schedule, which can reduce stress and anxiety.

What are some signs that a person is pure hearted?
Generally, there are a lot of signs which indicate that a person is pure-hearted.
Let me introduce a couple of them.
First, if someone is honest, particularly within a close-knit community, it demonstrates their purity. Honesty fosters mutual trust and opens many opportunities to develop a healthy relationship. When a person knows that their friend is a good character and has a pure heart, they feel more secure in their relationship.
Second, In a close people environment, having a pure heart also includes not judging others. In today's world, where judging has become a serious issue, people who refrain from judging tend to make more friends and become well-liked.
A Pure-hearted person has many beneficial attributes that can serve as a role model for people who don't have such features.

Should a bullied child's parents reach out to the bully's parents?
It would be a good idea to contact the parents of the child who bullied another child. Sometimes, children may not understand the consequences of their actions and continue to bully others. In such cases, parents can contribute to their child's safety. The parents of the child who bullied the other child need to have a deep discussion with their child and explain why bullying is wrong and the potential consequences it may cause. On the other hand, the parents of the bullied child need to have a gentle conversation with their child, encouraging them to be strong and not give too much attention to the bullying.

Is it okay not to have friends?
Of course, it is okay unless you are not feeling anxious or stressed because of not having friends. Everyone is unique and has different perspectives or angles of view. For some people who are introverts, having no friends and coping with everything alone is the best thing. Introverts and not only introverts can feel calm while being alone because being alone is their nature, and nothing wrong can happen. It's just the person decides what is better for them to feel happy and satisfied, being alone or having friends. Of course, there are situations in which a person feels stressed being alone. Therefore, they need to find and be with people who share the same interests. Indeed, being lonely is definitely normal if the person is in comfort.

What are some tips for becoming successful?
There are a lot of tips that can help you to become successful. I will tell some of them that I find helpful.
Understand your values and follow your values to not go against yourself.
Always learn from your mistakes and try to avoid or lessen them; then, you will realize that you become more successful every day.
Always carefully listen to people who give you advice. Some may be unuseful, but some may be worth it and a better guide.
Never give up because of failure or just because you are tired. Failure is a good motivation and, as I mentioned above, allows you to learn from mistakes. Tiredness will not lead you to any success, but diligence will.
Always try to do your best, and you will see that you will become a successful person one day.

How do I get over anxiety?
First, I suggest you analyze what usually causes you to fall into anxiety. After calculating in your mind and finding out what causes that feeling of uncertainty, try to avoid that particular situation, problem, or even a person who makes you anxious. Make your mind busy with things that you like or are interested in. You can go to a psychologist and share with him or her your certain causes of anxiety and ask them for help. Get a pet that can make you feel happy and get you out of that state. There are always solutions that can definitely help you to get rid of anxiety.

How can the lack of attention from parents negatively affect a young child?
Usually, when a child from early younghood starts lacking attention from parents, they become more closed or introverted. A child will think and consider the fact that no one needs him. He will not share his problems and concerns with their parents because of a lack of attention. Both in kindergarten and school, a child will feel jealous of others because their parents are giving the most attention to their child. A child will be mentally destroyed and traumatized. Furthermore, during school fights or bullies, the child having no friends because of being closed will not have anyone to talk with. The parent's lack of attention, resulting in the child being locked up and thus having no friends, will result in serious mental health issues.

Start-up failure? Do I stop?
Never stop something because of the failure. Failure gives motivation, power, and the opportunity to learn from mistakes. There are relatively rare situations when people succeed at once. Do you think the ""Apple"" company grew or made success immediately after producing their first phone?
The answer is no.
Usually, start-up companies are making tremendous efforts, going through some difficult times, having failures, and eventually recording success as ""Apple"" did. Always have plan ""b"" in case of plan ""a"" -s flop.
Never stop developing your start-up idea because of failure; instead, be motivated and work even harder, and one day, you will see how your business prospers and brings you a considerable outcome.

How do you stay alive if your family issues are too much?
If the person can realize that their life is more important than suffering because of family issues and eventually committing suicide, that person has excellent life potential.Of course, I can't support the fact that it's just necessary to hold everything back and obtain fear concerning family issues for the rest of your life. You don't need to not give too much attention to your family issues but rather try more to consider the pros. Life is short, and until it's not too late, you must take the action of control if everyone in your family avoids doing that essential step. First, it is for your own benefit, and you need to create comfort by eliminating or at least lessening family issues.

How can I motivate myself to study even if I'm not interested in education?
It is expected that studying does not interest you. It is a global problem. But didn't you think about your future lifestyle and major? Wasn't it worth it to start studying?
Imagine after some time, you will be an expert in your dream job by earning a lot of income. The fact that, finally, you will start being independent is the best motivation for you to start studying, even if you are not interested in education.
All this suffering and torment regarding studying will not last forever, but success will; indeed, it's a fact. Everything in this life is not for nothing, and if you have a goal, if you choose that particular path, then go ahead and reach your life destination, which will change your life completely.

I have always been ignored and socially rejected. I‚Äôm in college now. My only friend now ignores and socially rejects me. How can I cope with my depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts from being socially rejected my whole life?
All of us, at least once a time, expected or had the thoughts of being rejected by everyone. It is expected, especially nowadays. People are different, and you are also different. Draw a plan about your life goals and destination. Depression and anger are not forever; they last for a while, and then you realize there was no need to fall into depression because of a friend who didn't even have basic personal values. First of all, prioritize yourself and your goals. Eliminate suicidal thoughts because it will only make you worse. Depression is a life break, which will only weaken you. Anger is good; anger motivates you to prove to yourself first and then to others that you are the best. Walk a lot, and make time for yourself, your thoughts, and your dreams.

First, if you find a solution to your problem of feeling lonely by adopting a dog, you should talk to your parents by describing the situation. Sometimes, parents can't understand the purpose, so you need to have a deep dialogue with them. Avoid being entirely abandoned with your thoughts of failure. Try to reach your wish to your parents, which is essential for both your mental and physical health, by different methods. Tell them about the best angles for adopting a new friend and which, in turn, can benefit you. Try many times until you do not reach your destination. What's your goal in this context?
Of course, the elimination of the feeling of ""loneliness.""
