You are summoned to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County for a hearing on the Motion for Determination of Legal Representation for Respondents and Motion for Discovery to be held on the 10th day of July, 2025 at 9:30 oclock a.m. at the

You are summoned to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County for the Final Hearing on the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights in this matter set for the

Now, therefore, you the party named above, are commanded to be and appear on the date and time stated above and to remain in attendance from hour to hour, day to day, month to month, year to year and time to time, as said case may be continued, and until discharged by the Court, and you are commanded to lay any and all other business aside and to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County, Georgia, located at the Cook County Courthouse, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620 on the date and time specified in this Summons, and you the said parent, guardian or legal custodian are likewise hereby commanded to be and appear with the aforesaid children in said Court at the times and place herein stated, each of you then and there to make defense thereto and to show cause why the said children and all parties named herein should not be dealt with according to the provision of law.
You are hereby notified that these proceedings and the hearings specified herein are for the purpose of terminating your parental rights.
NOTICE OF EFFECT OF TERMINATION JUDGMENT
Georgia law provides that you can permanently lose your rights as a parent. A petition to terminate parental rights has been filed requesting the court to terminate your parental rights to your child.
If you fail to appear, the court can terminate your rights in your absence. If the court at the trial finds that the facts set out in the petition to terminate parental rights are true and that termination of your rights will serve the best interests of your child, the court can enter a judgment ending your rights to your child.
If the judgment terminates your parental rights, you will no longer have any rights to your
child. This means that you will not have the right to visit, contact, or have custody of your child or make any decisions affecting your child or your childs earnings or property. Your child will be legally freed to be adopted by someone else.
Even if your parental rights are terminated:
(1) You will still be responsible for providing financial support (child support payments) for your childs care unless and until your child is adopted; and
(2) Your child can still inherit from you unless and until your child is adopted.
This is a very serious matter. You should contact an attorney immediately so that you can be prepared for the court hearing. You have the right to hire an attorney and to have him or her represent you. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney if the court finds that you are an indigent person. Whether or not you decide to hire an attorney, you have the right to attend the hearing of your case, to call witnesses on your behalf, and to question those witnesses brought against you.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you may call the telephone number
of the clerks office which is (229) 896-7717.

Now, therefore, you the party named above, are commanded to be and appear on the date and time stated above and to remain in attendance from hour to hour, day to day, month to month, year to year and time to time, as said case may be continued, and until discharged by the Court, and you are commanded to lay any and all other business aside and to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County, Georgia, located at the Cook County Courthouse, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620 on the date and time specified in this Summons, and you the said parent, guardian or legal custodian are likewise hereby commanded to be and appear with the aforesaid children in said Court at the times and place herein stated, each of you then and there to make defense thereto and to show cause why the said children and all parties named herein should not be dealt with according to the provision of law.
You are hereby notified that these proceedings and the hearings specified herein are for the purpose of terminating your parental rights.
NOTICE OF EFFECT OF TERMINATION JUDGMENT
Georgia law provides that you can permanently lose your rights as a parent. A petition to terminate parental rights has been filed requesting the court to terminate your parental rights to your child.
If you fail to appear, the court can terminate your rights in your absence. If the court at the trial finds that the facts set out in the petition to terminate parental rights are true and that termination of your rights will serve the best interests of your child, the court can enter a judgment ending your rights to your child.
If the judgment terminates your parental rights, you will no longer have any rights to your
child. This means that you will not have the right to visit, contact, or have custody of your child or make any decisions affecting your child or your childs earnings or property. Your child will be legally freed to be adopted by someone else.
Even if your parental rights are terminated:
(1) You will still be responsible for providing financial support (child support payments) for your childs care unless and until your child is adopted; and
(2) Your child can still inherit from you unless and until your child is adopted.
This is a very serious matter. You should contact an attorney immediately so that you can be prepared for the court hearing. You have the right to hire an attorney and to have him or her represent you. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney if the court finds that you are an indigent person. Whether or not you decide to hire an attorney, you have the right to attend the hearing of your case, to call witnesses on your behalf, and to question those witnesses brought against you.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you may call the telephone number
of the clerks office which is (229) 896-7717.

Any unknown, unnamed father of the children, E.R.B. and O.J.B.
You are hereby notified that the above-styled action seeking to terminate your parental rights and place custody of said children with the Georgia Department of Human Services, acting through the Cook County Department of Family and Children Services, was filed in said Court on May 15, 2025. A copy of the Petition is attached to this Summons or if this Summons is served by publication, a copy of the Petition can be obtained from the Clerk of this Court during business hours.
You are summoned to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County for a hearing on the Motion for Determination of Legal Representation for Respondents and Motion for Discovery to be held on the 10th day of July, 2025 at 9:30 oclock a.m. at the
Cook County Courthouse, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620. Should you fail to appear at the above-mentioned hearing, the Order entered pursuant to the hearing will be made the Final Order of the Court.
You are summoned to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County for the Final Hearing on the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights in this matter set for the
14th day of August, 2025 at 9:30 oclock a.m. at the Cook County Courthouse, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620 Should you fail to appear at the above-mentioned hearing, the Order entered pursuant to the hearing will be made the Final Order of the Court.
Now, therefore, you the party named above, are commanded to be and appear on the date and time stated above and to remain in attendance from hour to hour, day to day, month to month, year to year and time to time, as said case may be continued, and until discharged by the Court, and you are commanded to lay any and all other business aside and to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County, Georgia, located at the Cook County Courthouse, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620 on the date and time specified in this Summons, and you the said parent, guardian or legal custodian are likewise hereby commanded to be and appear with the aforesaid children in said Court at the times and place herein stated, each of you then and there to make defense thereto and to show cause why the said children and all parties named herein should not be dealt with according to the provision of law.
You are hereby notified that these proceedings and the hearings specified herein are for the purpose of terminating your parental rights.
NOTICE OF EFFECT OF TERMINATION JUDGMENT
Georgia law provides that you can permanently lose your rights as a parent. A petition to terminate parental rights has been filed requesting the court to terminate your parental rights to your child.
If you fail to appear, the court can terminate your rights in your absence. If the court at the trial finds that the facts set out in the petition to terminate parental rights are true and that termination of your rights will serve the best interests of your child, the court can enter a judgment ending your rights to your child.
If the judgment terminates your parental rights, you will no longer have any rights to your
child. This means that you will not have the right to visit, contact, or have custody of your child or make any decisions affecting your child or your childs earnings or property. Your child will be legally freed to be adopted by someone else.
Even if your parental rights are terminated:
(1) You will still be responsible for providing financial support (child support payments) for your childs care unless and until your child is adopted; and
(2) Your child can still inherit from you unless and until your child is adopted.
This is a very serious matter. You should contact an attorney immediately so that you can be prepared for the court hearing. You have the right to hire an attorney and to have him or her represent you. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney if the court finds that you are an indigent person. Whether or not you decide to hire an attorney, you have the right to attend the hearing of your case, to call witnesses on your behalf, and to question those witnesses brought against you.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you may call the telephone number
of the clerks office which is (229) 896-7717.

Any unknown, unnamed father of the children, E.R.B. and O.J.B.
You are hereby given notice, that:
โThe biological father who is not the legal father may lose all rights to the child named in the petition brought pursuant to this article and will not be entitled to object to the termination of his rights to such child unless, within 30 days of receipt of notice, he files: (1) A petition to legitimate such child; and (2) Notice of the filing of the petition to legitimate with the court in which the termination of parental rights proceeding is pending.โ
Further,

READ CAREFULLY
Any party to this matter is entitled to representation by an attorney. If the Court determines that said party is unable, without undue financial hardship to provide payment for an attorney and all other legal expenses for representation, then such party becomes an โindigent personโ and is entitled to counsel as provided by O.C.G.A. ยง 15-11-103 All parties who feel that they cannot afford an attorney are hereby required to personally contact the Cook County Juvenile Court, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620, Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. to determine whether they are entitled to the appointment of an attorney.

Now, therefore, you the party named above, are commanded to be and appear on the date and time stated above and to remain in attendance from hour to hour, day to day, month to month, year to year and time to time, as said case may be continued, and until discharged by the Court, and you are commanded to lay any and all other business aside and to be and appear before the Juvenile Court of Cook County, Georgia, located at the Cook County Courthouse, 212 North Hutchinson Avenue, Adel, Georgia 31620 on the date and time specified in this Summons, and you the said parent, guardian or legal custodian are likewise hereby commanded to be and appear with the aforesaid children in said Court at the times and place herein stated, each of you then and there to make defense thereto and to show cause why the said children and all parties named herein should not be dealt with according to the provision of law.
You are hereby notified that these proceedings and the hearings specified herein are for the purpose of terminating your parental rights.
NOTICE OF EFFECT OF TERMINATION JUDGMENT
Georgia law provides that you can permanently lose your rights as a parent. A petition to terminate parental rights has been filed requesting the court to terminate your parental rights to your child.
If you fail to appear, the court can terminate your rights in your absence. If the court at the trial finds that the facts set out in the petition to terminate parental rights are true and that termination of your rights will serve the best interests of your child, the court can enter a judgment ending your rights to your child.
If the judgment terminates your parental rights, you will no longer have any rights to your
child. This means that you will not have the right to visit, contact, or have custody of your child or make any decisions affecting your child or your childs earnings or property. Your child will be legally freed to be adopted by someone else.
Even if your parental rights are terminated:
(1) You will still be responsible for providing financial support (child support payments) for your childs care unless and until your child is adopted; and
(2) Your child can still inherit from you unless and until your child is adopted.
This is a very serious matter. You should contact an attorney immediately so that you can be prepared for the court hearing. You have the right to hire an attorney and to have him or her represent you. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney if the court finds that you are an indigent person. Whether or not you decide to hire an attorney, you have the right to attend the hearing of your case, to call witnesses on your behalf, and to question those witnesses brought against you.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you may call the telephone number
of the clerks office which is (229) 896-7717.
