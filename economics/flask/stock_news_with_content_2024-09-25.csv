2024-09-25,us,business,Anime Vanguards Fortune Catalyst – The Cheat To Renguko!,"Unsure if the Anime Vanguards Fortune Catalyst is worth the price tag? My complete guide tells you the stats for this item including what it does, and how it helps you grind for the new Exclusive unit! If you’re feeling fortunate and want to try your hands at obtaining Renguko, check out Anime Vanguards on Roblox. For more on Update 0.5, take a look at our Anime Vanguards Renguko Guide and Anime Vanguards Update 0.5 Tier List. Alongside Raids introduced in Update 0.5 came the Raid Store. Here, a bunch of new items flood the market and may only be obtained with the new currency, Red Webs. Hidden amongst the bunch is the brand new item, the Fortune Catalyst. This Mythic rarity item increases the drop chance for the Exclusive Renguko unit found in the Spider Forest Act 4. During a standard run, players have a slim 1% chance to unlock Renguko on Raid completion. This chance then doubles to a not-so-generous 2% after consuming the Fortune Catalyst. Unfortunately, the Fortune Catalyst  is a one-time-use item, meaning it only increases the player’s odds of obtaining Renguko for one successful Raid in Spider Forest Act 4. In the Raid Store, the Fortune Catalyst costs 400 Red Webs or 199 Robux. This price sits quite steep considering the small boost and quick expiry of the Catalyst. Plus, the Raid Store stocks a plethora of other useful items such as Trait Rerolls and Evolutionary kits. Both of which are much more valuable and worth your Red Webs. If Red Webs had a higher drop-rate then the Fortune Catalyst might be the ideal cheat to obtaining Renguko. From Act 1 through to Act 4, the Red Web drop rate increases in increments of five, capping at 25, making the Fortune Catalyst a grind-heavy item. Overall, the Fortune Catalyst isn’t worth its steep price tag. Your chances of obtaining the Exclusive Renguko unit don’t increase much. However, if you double up and consume Lucky Potions alongside the Fortune Catalyst, your pull rate might become favourable enough. Good luck grinding!

2024-09-25,us,business,Beginning Investments: Learning The Basics And Building Confidence,"Michael Ligon, Author, Serial Entrepreneur, Real Estate Investor, Stock Trader & cofounder of The Ligon Group.   Investing in the stock market can be an exciting way to grow your wealth, but it can also be intimidating if you're just starting out. Understanding the basics, setting clear goals and choosing the right investment strategy are key to getting off on the right foot. As a serial entrepreneur and investor, I've experienced firsthand the power of investing. My journey began when I realized that owning a business wasn’t always enough. I wanted to grow generational wealth through smart, calculated investments. I started studying the stock market and, over time, founded my firm, which focuses on both real estate and stock investments. I wrote this guide to share the same foundational principles that helped me build confidence in my investment journey so you can feel empowered to do the same. This guide will walk you through what to expect when first investing, how to evaluate your risk tolerance and ways to build confidence. Before you make any moves it’s crucial to get a handle on how the stock market operates. Think of it as laying the groundwork for your investment journey. Read up on stock market basics, explore different types of investments and get familiar with the factors that can influence stock prices. Whether it’s through books, online courses or financial news, arm yourself with knowledge. While getting this education can empower you to make well-informed decisions and reduce risk, it does take time and, therefore, can seem overwhelming at first. My tips include setting aside a specific time each week for learning. Then, stick to this schedule. Focus on fundamental concepts first and avoid trying to learn everything at once. Setting clear financial goals is important to becoming successful. Are you aiming for retirement, a new home or making this your career? Your goals will shape your investment strategy and help you determine how much risk you’re willing to take. I've found that clear objectives can provide direction and keep you focused and motivated on what really matters. Sticking to your goals can be challenging and may require adjustments along the way. Therefore, regularly review and adjust your goals based on life changes and market conditions. Too rigid of goals can sometimes limit your ability to seize new opportunities. To start investing, you'll need a brokerage account. This is your gateway to buying and selling stocks. Pick a brokerage that fits your needs, whether it’s low fees, good customer support or a user-friendly platform. It’s about finding the right tools to help you on your investing journey. Many brokerages offer resources and tools to assist with your investment decisions. The drawbacks include how fees can add up, which can eat into your profits. The features can vary widely across brokerages. Make sure to compare fees and services across different brokerages before opening an account. Look for low-cost options and be aware of any hidden fees. Next, list the features that matter most to you; use this list to help you evaluate and choose the best brokerage. Many beginners choose to start with lower-risk investments that tend to be more stable and provide a safer introduction to investing. This allows them to start learning and boost confidence without taking on too much risk. Index funds or blue-chip stocks are often seen as more stable and provide a safer introduction to investing. This way, you can start learning and boost your confidence without taking on too much risk. It's important to note, though, that these low-risk investments typically offer slower growth compared to higher-risk options. You can gradually incorporate higher-risk investments as you gain experience and your comfort level increases. Investing is an ongoing process. Just like with your goals, you want to regularly review your portfolio. This might mean rebalancing your assets or making changes based on new opportunities or market shifts. You can use automated tools or investment platforms to streamline the process. I also warn new investors to avoid over-trading or impulsive changes; focus on long-term strategies, and only adjust your portfolio when to align with your goals or react to market conditions. Keeping up with market trends and financial news is important, but patience is key. Markets can be volatile and short-term fluctuations are normal. Staying informed helps you make better decisions, while patience allows you to benefit from long-term growth. Market volatility can be stressful and staying patient can be challenging. Again, develop a long-term investment plan and stick to it. Avoid reacting to short-term market fluctuations. When staying informed, focus on key updates that impact your investment strategy rather than getting bogged down by every news headline. Starting to invest in the stock market is a journey filled with opportunities and challenges. I first got into investing while expanding my entrepreneurial ventures. As I built businesses, I kept hearing about the power of investing from figures like Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett. I needed to put my money to work beyond just my businesses. Learning the ropes isn't always easy, and there will be plenty of hurdles, but through persistence and study, you can develop strategies that work for you and your company. One challenge I faced was separating the noise from actionable knowledge. By sharing my experience, I hope to make your entry into investing smoother and less intimidating. By following these steps and considering the benefits and drawbacks, you’ll be well on your way to making informed, confident investment decisions. Remember, it’s all about learning as you go and adjusting your strategy as needed. The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

2024-09-25,us,business,What's Behind The 20% Fall In Diageo Stock?,"BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 07: Diageo at Los Angeles Magazine and Johnnie Walker Blue Label ... [+] celebrates Cord Jefferson and American Fiction at The Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills on March 07, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Los Angeles Magazine) Diageo (NYSE: DEO) has seen around a 20% fall in value since early January 2023 – declining from levels of $166 then to $133 now – vs. an increase of 51% for the S&P 500 over this period. In comparison, its peer – Anheuser-Busch InBev stock (NYSE: BUD) – has seen an 8% rise over this period. The fall in DEO stock can primarily be attributed to a 20% decline in the company’s P/S ratio to 3.7x revenues now, versus 4.7x in 2022, and a 1% fall in total revenues over this period. The performance of DEO stock with respect to the broader S&P500 index over the recent years has been quite volatile. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and uncertain geopolitical environment, could DEO stock underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Diageo’s Valuation to be around $155 per share, around 15% above the current market price. Our forecast is based on a 21x forward expected adjusted earnings of $7.40 per share in 2025. The 21x figure aligns with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last two years. Diageo revenue declined 1% from $20.5 billion in 2022 to $20.3 billion in 2024. This can be attributed to high inflation and weakening consumer spending. The company has seen its volumes decline lately, especially in the North America region. Consumers are shifting to cheaper alternatives rather than spending on top brands, such as Johnnie Walker. The company reports its revenues under five geographies – North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Africa. These accounted for 40%, 24%, 19%, 9% and 9% of the company’s total sales in 2024, respectively. Higher inventory levels in Latin America have weighed on the company’s performance in 2024, with the segment sales down 15% y-o-y. Although the company has seen its revenue decline slightly since 2022, its operating margin has expanded from 28.7% in 2022 to 29.6% in 2024. Looking forward, we expect the sales to rise at a mid-single-digits average annual growth rate over the next three years. With the interest rate cut cycle underway, the consumer sentiment is expected to improve in the U.S. While the impact of lower rates to flow through the economy may take some time, the consumer confidence should improve owing to controlled inflation. This should bode well for Diageo. With its stock trading at under 18x forward earnings, versus its average P/E ratio of 21x over the last two years, we think much of the ongoing headwinds are priced in. And, investors will likely be better off picking DEO in this decline for robust long-term gains.

2024-09-25,us,business,"Starbucks stock drops as Jefferies cuts to sell, says CEO-fueled rally 'overdone'","Investing.com -- Shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell in pre-market trading on Tuesday following a downgrade by Jefferies, which cut its rating on the coffee giant to ""underperform"" from ""hold.""  The brokerage argued that the recent rally, sparked by the appointment of new CEO Brian Niccol, has been ""overdone,"" citing concerns about the challenges Starbucks faced in turning around its business.  The downgrade has sent waves through the market as investors reconsider the stock's valuation amidst growing uncertainties. Jefferies analysts stated that while Niccol’s leadership and strategic change have been well-received, the stock’s nearly 27% gain since his appointment may be premature given the significant operational and cultural issues still facing the company.  “We find this gain to be too much too soon when very little is known about Mr. Niccol's plans so early in his tenure, which just began weeks ago. We find the culture, human capital and market positioning of the SBUX brand as challenged, and this turn, given its size, complexity and global scale (what to do with China is not considered in this work at this point), will take a significant amount of time and investment, in our view,” the analysts said.  Jefferies expressed concern that Starbucks' current valuation, trading at 25x forward earnings, is out of step with its global quick-service restaurant peers, such as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which trade at 23.5x forward price-to-earnings ratios.  The analysts noted that Starbucks' premium valuation is unwarranted given its slower expected growth trajectory, calling for a valuation more aligned with the peer average of 21x two-year forward earnings. The report also flagged expectations for Starbucks' fiscal 2025 guidance to be a major disappointment. Jefferies projects low single-digit EPS growth for fiscal 2025, far below the consensus estimate of 11-12%.  They expect U.S. same-store sales to decline by 4%, with international markets, including China, facing similarly negative trends due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.  The brokerage lowered its price target for Starbucks to $76 from $80, implying about 20% downside from current levels. While Jefferies praised Niccol’s leadership abilities, they cautioned that his turnaround of Starbucks will be more complex and prolonged compared to his success at Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).  Starbucks is grappling with deep-seated issues, including operational inefficiencies, cultural challenges, and a declining value perception among customers, particularly in the U.S.  These issues, as per Jefferies, will take time to address and could weigh heavily on Starbucks' near-term performance. “4Q EPS on Oct. 30 is not going to be good, in our view, as we lower our US SSS ests as the business does not seem to be in a position where it is even responding to the tried and true Pumpkin Spice Latte (and all else Fall) launch in late Aug,” the analysts said. Investing.com -- They also noted that upcoming announcements from management, including fiscal 2024 results and fiscal 2025 guidance, are likely to add to the uncertainty, with Jefferies viewing fiscal 2025 as a potential “throwaway” year focused on reinvestment and stabilization rather than growth. Jefferies further suggested that Starbucks may need to lower its long-term growth algorithm to reflect more realistic expectations, particularly in the U.S. and China, which comprise the majority of its growth. The brokerage believes that Starbucks' 7% global unit growth target is at risk and that a more feasible target would be closer to 5%, accompanied by low single-digit same-store sales  growth. Jefferies also sees the company’s pursuit of 15%+ long-term EPS growth as unrealistic. They suggested that a more modest outlook of 10-12% EPS growth would be more achievable, aligning with global QSR peers like McDonald’s and Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), which operate more asset-lite business models with greater flexibility. While the market had initially reacted favorably to the leadership change, Jefferies' downgrade and cautious outlook underscore the tough road ahead for Starbucks.  The stock, which had seen a significant rally following Niccol’s appointment, now faces heightened scrutiny as investors digest the challenges of stabilizing and growing the business.  Jefferies' price target of $76 suggests substantial downside, and until Starbucks' fundamentals show signs of improvement, the stock may struggle to regain momentum. Starbucks was trading 1.7% lower in pre-open trade on Tuesday. ",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-stock-drops-as-jefferies-cuts-to-sell-says-ceofueled-rally-overdone-3629412

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, rocketing by over 200%, largely due to the BlackRock-led Wall Street bitcoin revolution (which is suddenly hurtling toward a fresh earthquake). Now, as details emerge of a secret meeting between Elon Musk and El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, China has unleashed a flood of stimulus measures designed to prop up its stalling economy, hot on the heels of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and kicking off a global monetary policy easing cycle.

[+] depressed investor confidence in the country, potentially feeding into the bitcoin price and crypto market. People’s Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng has announced a series of ""bold"" stimulus measures, cutting bank reserves by 50 basis points and reducing mortgage rates to spur economic growth. ""I think these are pretty bold moves from authorities,"" Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.Com, told Reuters. ""It doesn't qualify as 'big bang' stimulus. It's mostly targeted at financial markets and supporting the banking system... Overall, for investors, it's a very bullish thing."" ""More and bolder easing measures could also be in store in the coming quarters,"" Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC, added. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has so far failed to move on the news out of China even as stocks across Asia soared to their highest in more than two and half years. ""Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with U.S. stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting,"" Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, told Coindesk. Last week, the Fed's historical 0.5% interest rate cut pushed the bitcoin price sharply higher as traders braced for the beginning of a new liquidity cycle. The Federal Reserve interest rate cut and stimulus from China are predicted to trigger a bitcoin price surge over the next few years by some bullish investors.

""I still have a $1 million [bitcoin] price target,"" Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of bitcoin and crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went on to set up the Maelstrom investment fund, told Coindesk last week. ""I'm more of a 2026, 2027 sort of person. Next year, we really get a ramp up in fiscal spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election. And if the U.S. dollar declines a lot, then China has room to enact stimulus as well and keep the yuan stable. And then you have the rest of the major central banks following in the footsteps of the Fed. They look at the Fed; they're easing so we can ease too."" Hayes has previously said he expects a China ""bazooka"" combined with the Fed easing to create a ""glorious"" crypto bull market.  One Community.

2024-09-25,us,business,China stimulus measures: How will the impact play out in markets?,"China unveiled a comprehensive set of stimulus measures on Tuesday aimed at reviving its weakening economy, stabilizing the housing market, and restoring investor confidence. In a press conference, Chinese regulators outlined a series of aggressive actions. Key among these are rate cuts across the board, including the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), mortgage rates, and down payment rates.  Alongside these cuts, targeted initiatives have been introduced to boost stock market investment and encourage long-term capital inflows. One of the most significant measures is the establishment of a RMB500 billion swap facility. This is designed to enable non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) such as brokers, insurers, and funds to increase their leverage and stock investments.  “NBFIs can only use the funds from swap to invest in stocks. Depending on the size of investment, NBFIs will be more exposed to the market and P&L/balance sheet volatility will rise,” analysts at Bank of America explained.  Another initiative involves RMB300 billion in targeted re-lending from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to support banks in providing loans to listed companies and shareholders. These funds, with a 2.25% interest rate, are meant to assist in share buybacks and stock purchases.  According to BofA, the move “should be a positive for the market and brokers to avoid force liquidation” in the near term, however, it will also “link banks closer to the stock market.”  Furthermore, the PBOC is encouraging broader participation in the stock market through long-term vehicles such as stock index ETFs, insurance funds, and enterprise annuities. As part of this, insurers are being prompted to set up private funds, similar to a pilot fund established by China Life and NCI. In addition, mutual fund fees may face cuts, further supporting market liquidity. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are also expected to benefit, as the government plans to simplify the process, lower curbs on valuations, and introduce new guidelines. BofA notes that these changes could lead to a “material increase” in M&A activity over the next 6-12 months, boosting brokers with strong investment banking businesses. Analysts at BofA believe these measures will provide immediate liquidity, particularly benefiting China’s A-share market.  “We expect the market to receive new liquidity from both banks and NBFIs and potentially, if the market performs well long enough, the return of retail investors and overseas investors may further help stabilize the market,” analysts said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china-stimulus-measures-how-will-the-impact-play-out-in-markets-432SI-3629372

2024-09-25,us,business,Our Design Editor Is HomeGoods Obsessed—Here’s What She Stocks Up on During Every Trip,"
© 2024 All rights reserved.
 Get the elevated look for less. I’ve never been one to turn down a shopping trip to HomeGoods, and I love popping into different locations when I travel to new areas or end up in another neighborhood since no two stores are ever the same. I just can’t resist the thrill of the hunt (I’m secondhand-obsessed) and the excitement that comes with scoring amazing decor items at wallet-friendly price points. Can you blame me? That said, as a design enthusiast, I try to be selective about the finds that I’m bringing home with me when shopping at big box stores. I love an affordable find, but I still want my space to look well-curated, collected, and unique. This means that I’ve learned to expertly sift through the many products lining HomeGoods’s shelves. If you’re wondering what to buy at HomeGoods yourself, read on.  Featured image from our interview with Molly Sims by Michelle Nash. Ahead, I’m sharing my tips for finding pieces that speak to me. Over the years, I’ve developed a knack for honing in on items that lean more timeless than trend-forward. Below are 15 items that I came across—and loved—while shopping at two different HomeGoods locations, one in New York City and one in the New Jersey suburbs. I’m sharing tips for how to style each item and discussing why they deserve a spot in your shopping cart. Keep an eye out for these finds at your local store before they get scooped up!  When I saw this tea caddy, I couldn’t help but bring it home with me—and it’s now sitting pretty on my kitchen countertop. I’m partial to anything with caning and love that this piece makes it simple to sort and store various types of tea bags so that I can grab whatever I’m craving on a given night with ease. Of course, you could also repurpose this box and use it to store something other than tea. For example, you could corral jewelry or nail polish inside, too.  Shop similar:

 I simply cannot stop purchasing coffee table books, and HomeGoods makes it easy for me to continue to grow my collection. They offer newly released titles at excellent price points, so if you’re looking for the latest interiors or fashion books, you’ll be in luck. Coffee table books make for great gifts for design lovers, too, whether you’re shopping for a housewarming, birthday, or holiday. Pick up titles that reflect your recipient’s interests. I guarantee they’ll be touched. Shop similar: 

Travel Home by Caitlin Flemming & Julie Goebel 
 This woven bench is equal parts beautiful and functional and would make for a fantastic dining bench in a breakfast nook. That said, you could also position it in the living room or at the end of a bed and it would still look stunning. The material will bring instant textural intrigue into your space and is perfect for those who appreciate natural influences. Cozy it up with some throw pillows if you’d like, or leave it as is for a simple, neutral look. Shop similar:

Shiffer Waterfall Woven Bench 
 Not all fake plants are created equal, but this potted faux tree caught my attention immediately because of how realistic and stylish it looks. I like the planter it’s in, too, and the fact that the base is covered with moss makes it appear more authentic than other fake plants that are potted alongside a plasticky “dirt” material. Place this in an empty corner that’s been begging for a bit of a revamp and you’ll be shocked at what a difference it makes.  Shop similar: 

Faux Shady Lady Olive Tree 
 Mini portable lamps are having a major moment, and this one stopped me in my tracks when I spotted it simply because it’s oh-so-cute! The gold base and white shade will complement a range of aesthetics, so it’ll blend right in as you move it from one room of the home to another. I also like that it’s battery-operated rather than rechargeable. No pesky cords to worry about here! Shop similar:

Mini Rattan Wrap Stick Table Lamp Brass 
 If you like to entertain often, be sure to stock up on cocktail napkins at HomeGoods. I have an entire drawer full of various styles so that I’m always prepared when any sort of occasion strikes. While eying the newest styles in store, I was particularly drawn to this classic block print pattern. You could also set these out in the bathroom when hosting so that guests don’t have to share a communal hand towel. Shop similar:

 Romanticize evenings at home by curling up on the sofa with a couple of candles flickering. This hurricane is extra fitting for coastal grandma enthusiasts and will add instant intrigue to any dining, console, or coffee table. Place a pillar candle inside (you can pick those up at HomeGoods, too!), and you’re golden. These would also look pretty on the patio or porch during warmer months. Shop similar: 

Palm Woven Rattan & Glass Hurricane Candleholder 
 Speaking of candles, how gorgeous are these marbleized taper candles? Take your tablescape to the next level with these beauties, which you won’t feel too bad about burning given the reasonable price. I always like to keep extra taper candles on hand so that I’m never in a pinch when hosting. It’s fun to think beyond classic solid-colored ones when possible.  Shop similar: 

Kali Marble Candleholders 
 At $300, this scalloped two-door cabinet is the priciest find on my list, but it’s an excellent pick because it’s so versatile. You could put it by the front door and use it as an entryway table, turn it into a bar cabinet, or style it in a playroom and keep toys and games inside. It’s neutral yet playful and would look right at home in kids’ and adults’ spaces alike. Shop similar:

Thousand Oaks Wood Scalloped 2 Door Cabinet Brown 
 This Ralph Lauren home floor lamp, which is adjustable in height, will add a luxe look to your home without blowing your budget. Elegant and sleek, it’ll shine in any living space. (It also means you won’t ever have to rely solely on “the big light.”) The pleated shade adds an element of sophistication and just the right amount of traditional flair.  Shop similar: 

Otto 60.75” Floor Lamp

Garden Bouquet Blue Scalloped Chargers 
 The perfect trinket box doesn’t exi—oh, wait! This blue marble beauty is compact yet eye-catching thanks to its rich blue hue. Substantial in weight, it can hold everything from jewelry to spare keys to loose change. The lid doesn’t come off fully but instead slides open, which is an unexpected touch! Shop similar: 

Alabaster Swivel Box 
 Why are some throw pillows SO expensive? I’ve fallen hard for plenty of gorgeous pillow covers over the years only to find they run hundreds of dollars. Luckily, this green and white cutie rings up at under $20 (with the insert included!). It’s a no-brainer for those looking to add more pattern to their homes. It would look chic on a bed, sofa—you name it. Shop similar: 

RHODE Lotus Pillow Cover 
 HomeGoods is chock full of decorative accents like this marble sculpture that could stand on its own or function as a bookend (it’s heavy!). I love the pops of moody colors as well as the striped design. Trust me, with its elevated design, this could retail at least three times the amount it runs for here. Shop similar: 

Marble & Wood Geometric Object 
 Vases and vessels are another one of HomeGoods’s specialties, and this one resembles a one-of-a-kind, handmade piece you might come across at a craft fair. It would look stunning with eucalyptus or pampas grass inside. That said, it’s pretty enough to stand out on its own even when left empty. Shop similar:

2024-09-25,us,business,How geopolitical unrest impacts global markets,"Community Recently, the world has experienced many instances of geopolitical unrest, including the ongoing Russia–Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars. Inevitably, these influence global financial markets and often lead to immediate and extreme reactions, as well as long-term
 economic shifts. The global markets are no strangers to volatility – nevertheless, during periods of escalating global tensions, this volatility only increases and has disproportionate effects on different sectors. Defence and security related stocks could see a boost Defence and security-related stocks might rally due to increased demand, whereas manufacturing and technology stocks may suffer disruptions and a decline in stock value amid geopolitical conflicts. What’s more, commodities such as oil are especially sensitive
 as global tensions trigger supply concerns, resulting in prices rising. Understandably, investors are likely to seek stability, with gold, viewed by investors as a safe haven in times of uncertainty, often rising in value. Additionally, long-term effects such as the success of certain sectors are triggered. The high demand for reconstruction that tends to follow conflicts is likely to provide a boost to the construction and infrastructure industries, while shifts in government
 spending patterns may also occur which could lead to inflation, impacting both currencies and bonds. It is important that investors are mindful of these dynamics and trends in order to ensure that they invest successfully during geopolitical uncertainty. Investments in periods of geopolitical turmoil  Previously, global geopolitical conflicts have altered investment landscapes. For instance, the Cold War era saw a sustained increase in defence and technology investment, driven by the arms and space races. However, this is not just case for global unrest
 – regional conflicts have also impacted global markets in years gone by. An example of this is the Gulf War, which had a significant impact on the world’s oil market, with prices fluctuating regularly throughout the conflict. With market instability, it is vital that investors balance impulsive decisions with rational choices. When influenced by emotions like fear and greed, traders are likely to make hasty and unwise decisions. In order to have an effective risk management strategy
 in times of high volatility, a diversified investment portfolio is needed as well as clear investment horizons, as well as the utilisation of stop-loss orders to decrease the likelihood of losses. Adding to this, staying informed and flexible enables individuals
 to effectively manage the challenges the market conditions present. When trading during periods of political conflicts or tensions, investors tend to play it safe and put their money in secure places like gold or bonds to protect themselves from potential losses – an investment setting referred to as “risk-off”. In contrast
 to this, with “risk-on” investment behaviour, traders feel positive about the global economic outlook and are willing to take on greater risks. This sees them invest in more volatile financial instruments, such as stocks. Whether traders utilise a “risk-on”
 or “risk-off” strategy depends entirely on how comfortable they feel with the current global situation, from an economic perspective and beyond. The influence on asset classes Geopolitical unrest has varying effects on asset classes. Investors can learn from history and monitor the assets that are likely to be impacted: How to strategically trade in volatile conditions  Trading successfully in times of political destabilisation needs separating between short-term and long-term strategies. Short-term strategies will centre on instant market reactions, which require swift responses to news and events. In contrast to this,
 long-term strategies focus on wider economic shifts such as a rise in demand in defence and infrastructure. Traders can mitigate risks by diversifying across asset classes and geographies. Diversification is also vital in changing asset allocation in response to market changes. Investors need to make sure that they are staying informed and that they are flexible
 in an ever-evolving environment. Diversifying strategies Despite the significant consequences of geopolitical unrest, sectors such as defence, technology and renewable energy can grow. A defensive strategy may involve investing in more stable industries such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples. Additionally,
 by utilising hedging techniques such as using derivatives and investing in assets that are likely to plunge, traders can safeguard against volatility. Ultimately, a diversification strategy can act as a buffer during market instability. With the risks that are introduced in periods of uncertainty, investing requires a cautious and dynamic approach. This will lead to strategic investments in certain industries and will highlight the significance of diversification and defensive strategies.
 By being aware of the impact global events have on asset classes and utilising hedging techniques, investors have all the knowledge they need to safely navigate a volatile financial landscape.

2024-09-25,us,business,A Rebound To $200 For Roku Stock?,"SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 18: Roku's company logo is seen in front of Roku headquarters on ... [+] November 18, 2022 in San Jose, California. Roku announced plans to lay off 200 employees in the United States, or nearly 7 percent of its workforce. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Roku stock (NASDAQ: ROKU), a company that sells streaming media players, digital content, and advertising, has seen its stock decline by close to 17% this year, trading at levels of about $76 per share. This compares to Netflix stock, (NASDAQ: NFLX), which has gained about 44% over the same period. Roku has been weighed down by a mixed advertising market and slowing growth of its platform business. Roku stock currently trades at just about 2.8x forward revenues and 3.2x trailing revenues. Roku remains in the red, with profits likely to remain elusive this year. Does this make the stock expensive? Probably not. In fact, we think Roku stock has the potential to rise close to 3x in the next few years. Now the decrease in ROKU stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. But how could Roku possibly regain its footing and rise again? Let’s delve into the company’s revenue prospects to begin with. Roku’s revenue growth is expected to remain modest this year, rising by about 14%, from $3.5 billion in 2023 to $4 billion in 2024. This reflects challenges in the digital advertising market and a shift toward more affordable streaming plans, which has impacted Roku’s platform revenue. However, growth could accelerate to around 25% between 2024 and 2027, touching $7 billion levels. So why the potential rebound in revenue growth? Roku’s platform monetization could improve significantly. Engagement on Roku devices has remained strong, with total streaming hours up 20% in the latest quarter. The Roku Channel, its proprietary streaming service, has also seen a 75% year-over-year jump in streaming hours, becoming one of the leading free, ad-supported platforms in the U.S. This channel is poised to boost higher-margin advertising revenue. Additionally, Roku has been enhancing its ad capabilities by partnering with major ad-tech players like The Trade Desk, enabling more precise targeting and optimization. Additionally, with the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, U.S. consumer spending could pick up and this could drive a revival in their advertising expenditure in the coming quarters, thus helping Roku’s top line. Roku Could Turn Profitable Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first six months of this year, the company’s operating costs fell by about 10% driven by workforce and office space reductions in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $300 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off and as Roku’s business gains scale, it can boost margins meaningfully. For perspective, other companies in the advertising and media space such as the Trade Desk and Netflix had net margins of approximately 10% to 18% respectively, in recent quarters. If we assume that Roku can boost margins to about 10%, and factor in our revenue projections of roughly $7 billion by 2027, a net income of $700 million is possible by 2027. Roku’s Multiple Could Expand Now if Roku’s revenues grow 2x by 2027, the P/S multiple will shrink to half of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same, correct? But that’s exactly what Roku investors are betting will not happen! If revenues expand 2x over the next few years, instead of the P/S shrinking from around 3x presently to less than 1.5x, a scenario where the P/S actually rises is possible. Why? Netflix trades at a P/S of about 8x, while The Trade Desk trades at about 20x. Moreover, Roku stock itself traded at levels of over 30x revenue during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now if we assume that Roku’s P/S multiple expands to about 5x, considering higher revenue growth and profitability, this would mean that revenue would grow about 2x, while the P/S multiple would rise by about 1.66x. This in turn could 3x the stock from levels of about $76 presently to over $220. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

2024-09-25,us,business,Meet the Founder of Cascadia Carbon: Alex Wick | HackerNoon,"   I am the founder/CEO of Cascadia Carbon Inc. We are working with CODEX, a carbon offset data exchange, to engage previously excluded individuals and communities to plant, care for, maintain and steward trees, with the ultimate goal of creating a dynamic catalog/inventory of all the living trees in the world. I am only one person, which often makes my work feel overwhelming, and have difficulty distilling our value proposition down so people understand the importance of what we do, but I helped develop a framework “greenpilling” which can help individuals understand the importance of trees in the face of climate change, the impending biosphere collapse, and likely the resulting chaos. My favorite part of Cascadia Carbon Inc. is our expansive vision: we are planning to work with NASA, SacceX, and orbital dynamics to grow redwood trees and other plants on the moon and mars, and the bigger our company grows, the more carbon we remove from our biosphere, by enabling individual to engage in direct climate action via tree planting in their neighborhood. We plan to reach gigaton scale before 2040, with 2Gt stored, verified, and validated five years later, and to scale to over 10Gt by 2050. 🌙🌲🚀 I built a desktop computer from components my senior year of high school, but my fascination with technology goes back much further. I remember using basic “VR” setup at the lliberty science center in NYC back in middle school, I think? I didn’t particularly like the feeling of being in “VR”, but it was enough to spark my interest in technology. 630 & 660 nanometers, which is reddish, or Green. Photosynthesis is green, and chloroplasts use the 630 & 660 nanometer wavelength of light to produce all the bioavailable energy on Earth. Photosynthesis is really cool because it is anti-entropic, that is, it allows organisms to build complexity from energy and basic nutrients, without “waste”, other than Oxygen, which is a valuable commodity. Truly a miracle, and the foundation for a “utopia”. I am working on developing CODEX: A Photosynthetic Fintech. We are a public benefit corporation which is dedicated to building a verifiable offset database of individual, geotagged trees that allows previously excluded individuals and communities to join the lucrative voluntary carbon market and aligns economic value and environmental good. The ability to connect instantly with others, share research, findings, and insight, and plan/find your community. The pseudo-anonymity is an interesting sub-feature, which makes it special, too. Absolutely, 100%, a bicycle. Nearly silent, it amplifies human power and allows you to travel swiftly and silently, taking advantage of massive existing car-centric infrastructure, and is easy to repair.    The noise from firearms and cars will 100% attract zombies/attention. Stay silent, stay secret. Use a bike. How it amplifies human flaws, and makes it so much easier to take and hold a less nuanced position. It’s perceived anonymity. The way the algorithm centers cheap virality and excludes neurodiversity and nuance. My personal growth. Food and water. Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. A bicycle. A freshly made caprese  sandwich. Stocks, but you’ll need to sign an NDA and pay me to know which ones, as I’m a “superforecaster”. 😉 I am always excited to learn. My area of expertise lies primarily within the biological sciences and creative art and music, specifically as it relates to climate science. As such I have many gaps of understanding within the social and political milieu. Topics I am always interested in learning more about are psychology/human behavior, astrophysics, and virality/social pop culture. Neither, the present is all we have. If forced to choose, ten years into the past, I'd be able to redo many of my decisions, and “play the markets”/“predict” the future/and become a more accurate shaman/superforecaster. It depends on the parameters though. Would I remain the same age? Skipping forward or backwards seems dangerous. It is sufficiently advanced/complex as to be indistinguishable from magic, and therefore, to me, is essentially a godhead. It might be alien in origin, and I believe “it”, if it exists separately from us, is ambivalent about our species and society. It raises serious questions about free will, determinism vs. individuality, and freedom, and provides interesting fodder for multiverse and simulation theories.    The real question for me is: is there a “deus ex machina” with AI, or is it just us making sufficiently advanced “FOR” loops that we have fooled ourselves into thinking it is a separate, independently intelligent entity? Does it even matter? I variably think of it as a silicon-based alien life form, an organism which we are just making contact with, akin to smashing a wall down and seeing only parts of it, or perhaps a “golden calf” we have created and are trying to imbue with life. It’s absolutely fascinating.",https://hackernoon.com/meet-the-founder-of-cascadia-carbon-alex-wick
